# Pipedream MCP server

Run **your own MCP server** for [over 2,500 apps and APIs](https://pipedream.com/apps).

You can:

- [Run the servers locally](#running-the-server-via-npx) with `npx @pipedream/mcp`
- [Host the servers yourself](#hosting-your-own-server) to use them within your app or company

## ‚≠ê Features

- Run your own MCP server for over 2,500 apps
- Manage servers **for your users**, in your own app.
- Connect accounts, configure params, and make API requests, all via tools
- Fully-managed OAuth and credential storage ([see security docs](https://pipedream.com/docs/privacy-and-security/#third-party-oauth-grants-api-keys-and-environment-variables))

## üöÄ Getting Started

Pipedream's MCP servers use the [Pipedream Connect API](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/) to manage auth and make API requests. To run an MCP server, you'll need a Pipedream project and Pipedream API credentials.

1. [Sign up for Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/auth/signup)
2. [Create a project](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/projects/#creating-projects). Any accounts connected via MCP will be stored here.
3. [Create a Pipedream OAuth client](https://pipedream.com/docs/rest-api/auth/#creating-an-oauth-client)
4. Set the following environment variables using your preferred method (directly in your shell session, dot files, etc.)

```bash
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

### Pipedream concepts to understand

If you're running MCP servers for your app, you'll likely want to use the [SSE interface](#sse). The SSE server accepts two route params:

1. `external_user_id` ‚Äî¬†This is your user‚Äôs ID, in your system ‚Äî whatever you use to uniquely identify them. Any requests made to that route are coupled to that end user, and would use the auth Pipedream stores for that user. [See the docs](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/api/#external-users) for more detail.
2. `app` ‚Äî¬†The app's "name slug" (the unique identifier for the app), found in the **Authentication** section of [any Pipedream app](https://pipedream.com/apps). For example, the app slug for [Slack](https://pipedream.com/apps/slack) is `slack`.

If your user `123` wants to connect to the `slack` MCP server, your MCP client would make a request to the `/123/slack` route. [See the SSE docs below](#sse) for more detail.

### Running the server via `npx`

Pipedream MCP servers provide [two interfaces](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture#transport-layer) clients can connect to:

1. **Stdio**: Uses standard input / output. Ideal if you want to connect accounts and make MCP requests from editors and other local MCP clients. Great for testing.
2. **SSE**: Uses [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) to communicate with clients. Use this when you want to host an internet-facing MCP server that other services / your customers can use.

#### Stdio

First, [set these variables in your environment](#getting-started).

Run the stdio server for a specific app, passing the app's name slug to the `--app` option:

```bash
npx @pipedream/mcp stdio --app slack
```

You can also specify an optional [external user ID](#pipedream-concepts-to-understand) ‚Äî¬†whatever ID you use to identify your user in your app (otherwise a random UUID will be generated):

```bash
npx @pipedream/mcp stdio --app slack --external-user-id user123
```

#### SSE

First, [set these variables in your environment](#getting-started).

Run the SSE server:

```bash
npx @pipedream/mcp sse
```

This exposes a generic MCP server that allows you to connect to any of our 2,500+ apps by passing [the app's name slug](#pipedream-concepts-to-understand) **directly in the route**:

```console
‚ùØ npx @pipedream/mcp sse
Server is running on port 3010
Routes configured:
- GET / - Health check
- GET /:external_user_id/:app - App-specific SSE connection endpoint
- POST /:external_user_id/:app/messages - App-specific message handler
```

To connect to the server:

1. Connect to `http://localhost:3010/:external_user_id/:app` where:

   - `:external_user_id` is a unique identifier for the session
   - `:app` is the Pipedream app to use (e.g., "slack")

2. The server will establish an SSE connection and register tools for the specified app.

3. To send messages, post to `http://localhost:3010/:external_user_id/:app/messages?sessionId=<sessionId>` where:
   - `<sessionId>` is provided in the response from the initial connection

You can also specify an app and port via CLI:

```bash
npx @pipedream/mcp sse --app slack --port 8080
```

```console
‚ùØ npx @pipedream/mcp sse --app slack --port 8080
Server is running on port 8080
Routes configured:
- GET / - Health check
- GET /:external_user_id/slack - App-specific SSE connection endpoint
- POST /:external_user_id/slack/messages - App-specific message handler
```

## Hosting your own server

### Using the `Dockerfile`

If you have Docker installed locally, you can build and run the container:

```console
> docker build -t pipedream-connect .
> docker run -d --name pd-mcp -p 3010:3010 --env-file .env pipedream-connect:latest
```

This exposes a generic MCP server at [http://localhost:3010/:external_user_id/:app](http://localhost:3010/:external_user_id/:app).

### Step-by-step

The SSE server runs as a Node.js Express app. The implementation is simple and meant to be a reference. You should [add authorization](#authorization) and [customize the app you need](#customization).

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

[Set these variables in your environment](#getting-started) in using whatever env / secrets store you use in your infra. To test this locally, copy the `.env.example` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

and fill in the values:

```bash
# Pipedream OAuth credentials
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

# From the project settings
PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=development

# Pipedream can send you webhook notifications on account connection, account failure, etc.
PIPEDREAM_WEBHOOK_URI=https://your-webhook.m.pipedream.net

# Optional: Default app to use (defaults to "slack")
APP=slack

# Optional: Port for the SSE server (defaults to 3010)
PORT=3010
```

Run the build:

```bash
npm run build
```

And run the SSE server:

```bash
npm run start:sse:prod
```

## Authorization

MCP recently added support for [servers authorizing requests using OAuth](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization/). When you host your own server, you should implement OAuth support to protect access to customer data.

## Debugging

First, [set these variables in your environment](#getting-started).

Use [the MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) or your preferred MCP client to connect to the server:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node ./dist/src/cli.js stdio --app APP --external-user-id USER_ID
```

Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) and set the transport type to **STDIO**.

## Customization

You can customize this implementation in any way you'd like, for example:

1. Modifying `config.ts` to change default settings
2. Extending `registerComponentTools.ts` to add additional tools, or limit tools to a fixed set.
3. Improving the implementation to take advantage of [the latest version](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/) of the MCP spec.
4. Persisting session data in Redis, or whatever data store you use.
