\# Salesforce UI â€“ Pre-alpha Demo



A minimal HTML/JS interface to test the main Salesforce API actions:



\- Get record by Id

\- Update record by Id

\- Upsert record by External Id

\- List custom fields for an object



This demo uses static HTML and fetches internal API endpoints (e.g. `/api/sf/...`) defined by the back-end.



\## Next Steps

Once endpoints and object names are confirmed by maintainers, this will be turned into a PR for the main project.
