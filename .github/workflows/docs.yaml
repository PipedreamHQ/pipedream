        # This will be slow. The intent is to fetch all commits
        # since the merge-base (the commit where we branched off)
        # so we can check the git diff against all changed files.
        # By default, the checkout action only returns the last commit,
        # There's no native way to do this in the checkout action, so 
        # we have to fetch the entire history. See
