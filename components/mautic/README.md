# Overview

The Mautic API empowers marketers to automate and integrate a wide range of marketing tasks directly into Pipedream workflows. With Mautic's API, you can manage contacts, campaigns, emails, and reports, and use triggers to automate responses based on user behavior. It's a robust tool to align marketing efforts with real-time data and actions, making it possible to personalize communication, streamline follow-ups, and ultimately drive conversions with less manual effort.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Scoring Automation**: Automatically update lead scores in Mautic when specific events occur in a connected CRM like Salesforce. For instance, if a contact closes a deal, use Pipedream to listen for the event and then increase the contact's lead score in Mautic.

- **Dynamic Email Campaigns**: Use Pipedream to monitor customer activity from an e-commerce platform like Shopify. When a customer makes a purchase, trigger a Mautic API call to enroll them in a post-purchase email sequence, providing relevant cross-sells, upsells, or loyalty program details.

- **Real-Time Analytics Sync**: Integrate Mautic with a tool like Google Sheets using Pipedream. Whenever a new campaign report is generated in Mautic, automatically send the data to Google Sheets for real-time analysis, enabling marketers to make data-driven decisions quickly.
