# Overview

The Vtiger CRM API lets you tap into your customer relationship data to create, read, update, and delete records across various entities such as contacts, leads, and opportunities. In Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate workflows, sync data across platforms, and react to events in real-time, all without the need for dedicated backend code. You can create dynamic workflows that respond to webhooks, schedule tasks, and integrate with 3,000+ apps readily available on Pipedream.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Scoring Automation**: Automatically score and qualify leads in Vtiger CRM by setting up a workflow on Pipedream that processes incoming leads, evaluates them against predefined criteria, and updates their score in the CRM.

- **Sync Contacts with a Newsletter Service**: Keep your Vtiger CRM contacts in sync with a newsletter service like Mailchimp. When a new contact is added to Vtiger CRM, a Pipedream workflow can trigger that adds the contact to a specific Mailchimp audience, ensuring your mailing lists are always up-to-date.

- **Customer Support Ticketing Integration**: Integrate Vtiger CRM with a customer support platform such as Zendesk. Whenever a support ticket is resolved in Zendesk, a Pipedream workflow can update the related customer record in Vtiger CRM, adding notes or changing the status based on the outcome of the support ticket.
