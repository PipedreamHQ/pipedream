# Overview

The Mastodon API enables automation and integration with Mastodon, an open-source, decentralized social network. Using Pipedream, developers and social media managers can create automated workflows that interact with Mastodon instances by posting toots (messages), managing followers, and monitoring activity. Integration with Pipedream expands the potential of the Mastodon API, allowing users to trigger actions based on a variety of events, orchestrate data flow with other services, and build custom serverless workflows.

## Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Sharing**: Share new blog posts or updates from other platforms to Mastodon automatically. When your CMS (like WordPress) publishes new content, trigger a Pipedream workflow that posts a toot with the title and link to the article.

- **Social Media Engagement Tracker**: Monitor mentions and hashtags on Mastodon. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers when your account is mentioned or a specific hashtag is used. The workflow could log this data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet for analysis and engagement tracking.

- **Cross-Platform Posting**: Syndicate Mastodon posts to other social networks. Create a Pipedream workflow that listens for new toots from your Mastodon account and cross-posts them to Twitter, LinkedIn, or Facebook, ensuring your message reaches a broader audience.
