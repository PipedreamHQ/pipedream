# Overview

Middesk API is a game-changer for businesses looking to automate their background checks and company verifications. It's the bridge between your company and critical data on businesses you plan to engage with. Through the Middesk API on Pipedream, you can seamlessly conduct due diligence, validate company information, and ensure regulatory compliance. From automating onboarding workflows to real-time monitoring of business status changes, the integration possibilities with other apps and services are both robust and precise.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Vendor Onboarding**: As soon as a new vendor is added to your CRM, you can trigger a workflow that uses Middesk to perform thorough background checks and business verifications, ensuring they meet your compliance standards before onboarding.

- **Real-time Business Status Tracking**: Connect Middesk to a database monitoring service on Pipedream. Monitor for updates or changes in the status of businesses you work with and trigger alerts or update records in your internal systems to reflect the new status.

- **Compliance Report Generation**: Schedule a regular workflow that pulls the latest verification data from Middesk for all your active vendors and compiles a compliance report, which can be formatted and sent to your compliance team or stored in your document management system.
