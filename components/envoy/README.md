# Overview

The Envoy API empowers users to streamline workplace operations, particularly visitor management, deliveries, and room bookings. Leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can automate tasks involving these aspects. For example, you can receive notifications when guests arrive, sync visitor data with other systems, or automate the creation and management of room bookings.

# Example Use Cases

- **Visitor Arrival Notifications**: Get a real-time alert in Slack via Pipedream when a guest checks in through Envoy. This workflow can enhance security and hospitality by promptly notifying the relevant personnel of a visitor's arrival.

- **Automate Guest Wi-Fi Credentials Distribution**: After a visitor registers in Envoy, trigger a workflow that automatically generates Wi-Fi credentials and sends them to the visitorâ€™s email. This can help streamline the process of providing internet access to guests, ensuring a smooth experience.

- **Sync Visitor Logs with Google Sheets**: Save visitor check-in and check-out times to a Google Sheet for record-keeping and analytics. This workflow can assist in maintaining accurate visitor logs and making data-driven decisions about workplace resource management.
