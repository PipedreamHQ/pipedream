# Overview

AltTextLab's API provides powerful AI-generated alternative text for images - enhancing SEO, accessibility, and automation workflows. With Pipedream, you can create workflows that generate alt text for images automatically, connect it with your CMS or e-commerce platform. Pipedream’s serverless architecture lets you trigger these workflows on events, schedules, or incoming webhooks without maintaining your own infrastructure.
# Example Use Cases

- **Automated SEO Optimization for E-commerce**: Automatically generate alt text for new product images uploaded to a Shopify or WooCommerce store and save the metadata to your CMS or database.

- **Content Publishing Pipelines**: When a new blog post with images is published in your CMS (e.g., Ghost, WordPress, Webflow), send the image URLs to AltTextLab, generate alt text, and attach it back to the post or send it via email for editorial review.

- **Bulk Image Processing for Media Libraries**: Periodically scan a folder in Dropbox, S3, or Google Drive for new images and generate alt text descriptions for accessibility compliance and tagging.
