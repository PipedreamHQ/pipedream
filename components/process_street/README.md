# Overview

The Process Street API empowers you to automate and integrate your checklists and workflows with other apps to streamline business operations. With the API, you can create workflows, manage tasks, trigger actions based on checklist completion, and synchronize data across tools. This paves the way for endless possibilities in terms of project management, compliance tracking, onboarding processes, and routine audits, all managed within the familiar interface of Process Street but supercharged with Pipedream's connectivity.

# Example Use Cases

- **Workflow Management Automation**: Automatically create Process Street checklists from a project management tool like Asana or Trello. When a new task is marked as complete in Asana, trigger a Pipedream workflow to create a corresponding checklist in Process Street to ensure all subtasks and compliance requirements are assessed.

- **Dynamic Checklist Deployment**: Use Pipedream to deploy checklists in Process Street based on customer actions. For example, once a customer signs up on your platform, a Pipedream workflow can trigger the creation of an onboarding checklist in Process Street, ensuring consistent onboarding experiences.

- **Data Synchronization Across Tools**: Keep your CRM, like Salesforce, in sync with Process Street. When a sales deal is marked as won in Salesforce, a Pipedream workflow can update or create a checklist in Process Street for the account management team, ensuring a seamless transition and kickoff for account setup and management.
