# Overview

The Hotjar API lets you tap into real-time feedback and user behavior analytics. With Pipedream, you can automate workflows using this data to enhance user experience, respond to feedback quickly, and integrate user insights into your broader ecosystem of tools. By crafting custom functions or responding to webhooks in Pipedream, you can connect Hotjar with other services to create seamless, data-driven processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Trigger Email Campaigns Based on User Feedback**: When Hotjar captures negative user feedback, trigger an automated email outreach in a service like Mailchimp or SendGrid from Pipedream. This workflow can help you address concerns proactively and improve customer satisfaction.

- **Create Trello Cards for User Issues**: Use the Hotjar API to monitor for specific user issues or feedback, and automatically create Trello cards for each issue. This can help your product or customer service team prioritize and track user-reported problems efficiently.

- **Sync User Feedback to Google Sheets**: Set up a workflow that sends new user feedback from Hotjar directly to a Google Sheets document. Use this to analyze trends, share insights with your team, and maintain a living document of user experiences.
