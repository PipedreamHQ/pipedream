# Overview
By connecting your Google Chat account to Pipedream, you'll be able to incorporate your Google Chat data into whatever you're building with any of the 1,700+ apps that are available on Pipedream. 

# Getting Started
The Google Chat (Developer App) setup is only available for Google Workspace users. See [here](https://developers.google.com/chat/troubleshoot/apps#workspace-users) for more details. If you are not a Google Workspace user, you can use Pipedream's [Google Chat](https://pipedream.com/apps/google-chat) application alternatively. 

The steps are outlined below:

## Creating a Google Chat app
In order to connect your workspace Google Chat account to Pipedream, you'll need to create a custom OAuth app in Google Cloud. This requires a Google workspace account.

1. Sign in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/)
2. Select an existing project or create a new one

2. Add the scopes that you chose when setting up the app in a space-separate list.
3. Click **Connect**
4. You will be presented with an OAuth consent screen and should see the scopes that you specified at this step. Click **Allow**.

    ![Click Allow to Continue](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpenc2lit/image/upload/v1704752139/Screenshot_2024-01-08_at_2.15.12_PM_pzk47x.png)

5. You should now be able to use your Google Chat application that you created on Pipedream!

## Publish your Google Chat app (EXTERNAL ONLY)
Google has a [7 day expiration window](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#:~:text=A%20Google%20Cloud,Connect%20equivalents) on refresh tokens for applications that are set to **External** users with a publishing status of "Testing", so you will need to **Publish** your application in order to maintain your account connection.

1. Navigate to your application, and click **OAuth Consent Screen** on the lefthand sidebar.
2. Under **Publishing status**, click **Publish App**. If you included any sensitive or restricted scopes in your app, there will be a disclosure stating that you will need to go through the process of verification. Click **Confirm**.
3. Your application will not be available externally unless you share your **client_id** with others, and you will not have to go through the verification process unless you intend to onboard over 100 users.
4. The publishing status should be set to **In production**, and your account should maintain its connection without an expiration window.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Helpdesk Bot**: Create a bot within Google Chat that listens for keywords related to IT support and automatically responds with troubleshooting advice or escalates the issue by creating a ticket in a service like Zendesk or Jira.

- **Project Management Notifications**: Set up a workflow that monitors project management tools such as Asana or Trello for updates, and then posts these updates to a dedicated Google Chat space, ensuring your team stays informed about project progress in real-time.

- **Meeting Coordinator**: Develop a bot that helps schedule meetings by integrating with Google Calendar. When a meeting request is mentioned in a chat, the bot can check participants' availability, propose times, and send calendar invites, streamlining the scheduling process.


# Troubleshooting
