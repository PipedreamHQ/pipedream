# Overview

The Filter API is a great way to build powerful workflows that can manipulate and transform data. Here are some examples of what you can build using the Filter API:

- A workflow that transforms data from one format to another

- A workflow that filters out data that does not meet certain criteria

- A workflow that sorts data in a specific order

- A workflow that calculates statistics or aggregates data

- A workflow that combines data from multiple sources
