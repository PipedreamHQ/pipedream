# Overview

The E-conomic API allows for the automation of accounting tasks, enabling seamless integration of financial data into custom workflows. With Pipedream's capability to connect to the E-conomic API, you can trigger actions based on invoice creation, update financial records in real-time, and sync data across various business tools. By harnessing this API, businesses can streamline their financial processes, reduce manual data entry, and gain clearer insights into their financial health.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing**: When a new invoice is created in E-conomic, trigger a Pipedream workflow to send a notification via Slack to the finance team for approval. Once approved, the workflow could update the invoice status in E-conomic and send a confirmation email to the customer.

- **Expense Tracking and Reporting**: Set up a workflow that monitors new expenses entered in E-conomic. The workflow can aggregate this data weekly and automatically generate a report, which is then sent to Google Sheets for further analysis. A summary of this report can be dispatched to key stakeholders through an email using a service like Gmail.

- **Synchronized Customer Management**: On the creation of a new customer in a CRM like Salesforce, trigger a Pipedream workflow to create the corresponding client in E-conomic. If the customer updates their details in Salesforce, the workflow will keep the records in sync, ensuring accurate and up-to-date financial data in E-conomic.
