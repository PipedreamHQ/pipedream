# Overview

The E-conomic API is a powerful tool for managing financial operations within the E-conomic accounting software. Using this API on Pipedream allows users to automate financial tasks, sync data across multiple platforms, and enhance data-driven decision-making processes. The API can handle tasks like invoice creation, payments tracking, and financial reporting, making it an essential tool for businesses looking to streamline their accounting practices.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automatic Invoice Creation on New Shopify Orders**: When a new order is placed on Shopify, this workflow triggers an event on Pipedream, which then uses the E-conomic API to create an invoice for that order. This can help ensure that accounting records are updated in real-time, reducing manual entry errors and improving financial accuracy.

- **Sync New Customers to a CRM**: Whenever a new customer is added in E-conomic, this workflow can automatically add that customer's details to a CRM system like Salesforce. This ensures that sales and accounting data are aligned, which can improve customer relationship management and sales tracking.

- **Monthly Financial Reports Automation**: At the end of each month, this workflow can use the E-conomic API to gather all necessary financial data and compile it into a comprehensive report. This report could then be automatically sent to stakeholders through an email delivery service like SendGrid. This automated workflow helps in maintaining regular financial oversight without manual intervention.
