# Overview

The E-conomic API enables developers to access the vast majority of data and
functions available through the E-conomic online accounting system. This
includes accessing and manipulating customer, invoice, product, and journal
data. The API also enables integration with third-party applications, such as
online shopping carts and order management systems.
