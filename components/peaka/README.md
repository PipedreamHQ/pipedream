# Overview

The Peaka API provides tools for managing and automating tasks related to e-commerce, such as inventory management, order processing, and customer relationship management. By integrating Peaka with Pipedream, users can automate complex workflows involving other apps and services, facilitating real-time data syncing, automated reporting, and enhanced customer interactions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Order Processing**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream that listens to new orders from Peaka and automatically creates invoices using an accounting service like QuickBooks. This reduces manual entry errors and speeds up the billing process.

- **Customer Support Automation**: Design a workflow where customer queries from Peaka trigger notifications on Slack or Microsoft Teams. This can also include automatically creating or updating tickets in a CRM like Salesforce or Zendesk, ensuring that customer issues are addressed promptly and efficiently.

- **Inventory Management Sync**: Create a workflow that monitors stock levels in Peaka and updates inventory counts in real-time across multiple platforms, such as Shopify or WooCommerce. This helps maintain accurate stock levels, preventing overselling and helping with timely reorder alerts.
