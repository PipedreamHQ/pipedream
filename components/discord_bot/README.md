# Overview

The Pipedream Discord app enables you to build event-driven workflows that interact with the Discord API. When you authorize the Pipedream app's access to your guilds, you can use [Pipedream workflows](/workflows/) to perform common Discord [actions](#workflow-actions), or [write your own code](/code/) against the Discord API.

# Getting Started

To use the Discord Bot integration, you'll need to create a Discord bot and add that bot to your server(s). Watch the 4 minute video below for a short tutorial:

1. Create a new [Discord Developer Application](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Within your new application, create a Bot
3. Define the permissions you'd like the bot to have access to
4. If your bot will need to list other members of a guild, make sure to enable the **Server Members Intent** toggle on the Bot configuration page
5. Open the OAuth URL generator tool under the **OAuth2** menu
6. Select the `bot` auth scope
7. Copy and paste the URL into a new window
8. Accept the permissions to install the bot on your server

Not sure if you need to use the Discord or the Discord Bot integration for your workflow? Here's are the general similarities and differences:

Discord and Discord Bot actions and triggers _can_ both:

* Listen to events on Discord channels, guilds, etc.
* Perform actions like sending messages, managing channels, and members

However the Discord integration will perform actions with the official Pipedream Discord bot.

Using the Discord Bot integration will use a custom bot instead, with it's own name and photo.

## New Messages in Channel

[**Create this source here**](https://pipedream.com/new?h=eyJuIjoiTmV3IE1lc3NhZ2UgaW4gQ2hhbm5lbCBmcm9tIERpc2NvcmQgQm90IEFQSSIsInYiOjIsInQiOlsiZGlzY29yZF9ib3QtbmV3LW1lc3NhZ2UtaW4tY2hhbm5lbCJdLCJzIjpbXSwiYyI6e319).

This event source emits events each time a new message is delivered to a Discord channel. By default, it emits an event for every message.

When you create this source, you'll be prompted to connect your Discord Bot token (press Connect Account and then New to add your token). The source will use that token to list the guilds / channels that bot has access to.

We use Discord's API to poll for new messages in this channel **once a minute, by default**, but you can increase this to run up to once every 15 seconds, if you'd like.

The first time this source runs, it fetches up to the last 100 messages sent to your channel and stores the ID of the last message delivered to that channel. The next time the source runs, it polls your channel for messages sent after that ID.

By default, this event source is configured to emit an event for every new message in the channel. For example, if 5 messages are sent to the channel in one minute, the source will emit 5 events, one for each message. You can set the source to batch the events the source collects and emit them as a single event by setting the **Emit messages as a single event** parameter to `true`.

In this example, the source would emit a single event: an array of 5 messages.

## Message content is empty or missing

If you've successfully authenticated your Discord Bot to Pipedream, but the incoming message data including `content`, `embeds` and `attachments` are empty; then your bot needs to [apply for access to this messaging data](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404772028055-Message-Content-Privileged-Intent-FAQ).

At the time of writing, Discord only requires bots in 100 or more servers to apply for this access.

You can request for this approval in the **Discord Developer Portal**.

# Troubleshooting

Make sure your bot has the required privileges:

If you have issues with this integration, please join our public Slack and ask for help.

## Limitations of the Bot integration on Pipedream
Right now, the Discord Bot integration cannot utilize the [Discord Gateway](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway) to receive events via websockets or make API requests that require an initial connection to the gateway.

[Please reach out](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/issues/new/choose) if prevents you from building a workflow. We're happy to prioritize support for this in the future.
