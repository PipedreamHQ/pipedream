✅ The algorithm recognizes brand marks and logos, returning a JSON with the elements found in the image. One of the core features of our technology is that it usually does not require any additional actions to begin supporting a new logo, unlike most other solutions for logo detection.  
✅ This solution provides out-of-the-box support for an extensive range of brands, encompassing a vast array of logos and trademarks. Furthermore, it incorporates advanced, sophisticated logic designed to automatically identify unknown ones.
