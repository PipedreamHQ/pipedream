### Result image representation

By default, Car Image Background Removal returns a PNG image saved to a local file storage in the `/tmp` directory with a random filename. However, in some cases, it may be more appropriate to have an alternative representation of the result image.

Here is a list of possible result image representations:
  * **path** to a file (default)
  * **URL** to a file hosted by api4ai (valid for 1 day)
  * **Base64** string with file's content
  * **Buffer** encoded in JSON with a file's content
  * **Array** of bytes with a file's content

In general, the result image representations are same as those for the `Image` option. Please refer to the `Image` section above for examples of each representation.

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: If you choose the `URL to file` option, Car Image Background Removal will return a direct URL to the resulting image file hosted by API4AI. Please be informed that API4AI hosts resulting images for **one day**.

üí°Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è **Hint**: If you wish to use a base64 encoded image as the `src` attribute value of an `<img>` HTML element somewhere in your pipeline, remember to add `data:image/png;base64,` (don‚Äôt forget the comma!) before the actual base64 content. This informs the web browser that the `src` contains a PNG image encoded as base64 rather than a URL. For more information on displaying base64 images in HTML, visit: https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-display-base64-images-in-html.html


### Mask mode

By default, the Cars Image Background Removal returns a PNG image with the background removed. However, in some use cases, it is preferred to receive a mask of the car. Technically, the mask is also a PNG image, but instead ofcontaining the original image content with the background removed, it consists of pixels ranging from black to white. White pixels correspond to the car, while black pixels correspond to the background area. Grayscale pixels are transitional.

### Draw a shadow

To enhance visual appeal, the Car Background Removal may add realistic shadows to the segmented car images. This optional enhancement significantly improves the overall presentation of car images, making them more attractive for online listings and promotional materials. You can enable or disable this feature using the "Draw shadow" option.

### Hide car license plates

The "hide car license plate" feature may be needed for privacy and security or other reasons. This feature may be particularly important when sharing car images online or in public settings where the license plate may be visible to others.

The Car Image Background Removal offer an advanced blurring feature for license plates of any country or shape ensures global privacy and compliance, ideal for car dealerships, automotive photographers, and online marketplaces aiming to improve digital images while adhering to privacy laws.

## Returned values

The "Car Image Background Removal" action returns a set of values which can be used to obtain processing results:

* `result` (string) ‚Äì The resulting PNG image, represented as base64 string or a URL to a file hosted by api4ai (valid for 1 day).
* `width` (number) ‚Äì The width of the result image (same as the input image).
* `height` (number) ‚Äì The height of the result image (same as the input image).
* `objects` (array) ‚Äì An array of objects in the image.

### About "objects"

`objects` is an array of objects in format:

```json
{
  "class": "CLASS",
  "box": {
    "x": X,
    "y": Y,
    "w": W,
    "h": H
  }
}
```

Where:
* `CLASS` represents the object class.
* `X`, `Y`, `W`, `H` denote the bounding box dimensions.

Bounding box coordinates are normalized, meaning they range from `0.0` to `1.0`. Multiply `X` and `W` by the image's width and `Y` and `H` by the image's height to convert to pixels.

Possible classes:
* `opaque-content`. The "Cars Image Background Removal" always returns this object, corresponding to the area of opaque content in the result image. The content outside this area in the result image is fully transparent.
* `license plate`. Returned when "Hide car license plates" is enabled and car license plate(s) are detected.
