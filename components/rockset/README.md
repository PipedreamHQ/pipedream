# Overview

Rockset is a real-time indexing database service designed for low-latency, high-concurrency analytics. With the Rockset API, you can query your datasets, create and manage collections, and integrate with event streams for real-time analytics. Using Pipedream's serverless platform, you can automate workflows that react to database events, sync data across services, or trigger actions based on analytical insights.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time Dashboard Updates:** Couple Rockset with a web app service like Netlify to automatically deploy updates to your dashboards. When Rockset detects a significant data change or trend, a Pipedream workflow triggers a rebuild of your static site hosted on Netlify, ensuring your analytics dashboards reflect the latest insights.

- **Data Pipeline Orchestration:** Use Rockset in tandem with AWS Lambda to process and move large datasets. Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for new data in Rockset collections, processes the data with a Lambda function, and then pipes it to another database or data warehouse like Amazon Redshift for long-term storage and complex querying.

- **Event-Driven Notifications:** Combine Rockset with communication apps like Slack or email services such as SendGrid. Create a Pipedream workflow that sends notifications or reports to specified channels or recipients when the Rockset API returns query results that meet certain business-critical conditions, like inventory levels falling below a threshold or unusual patterns in user activity.
