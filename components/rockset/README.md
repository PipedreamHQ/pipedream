# Overview

Rockset API is a modern API for real-time query on complex data. With Rockset,
you can build applications with routinely updated datasets, such as web traffic
logs, machine generated data, sensor data, ad-tracking data, and IoT device
data, to unlock real-time insights and actionability. In this article, weâ€™ll
discuss the various types of applications you can build with Rockset API.

Rockset gives you the power to:

- Quickly ingest and index data from a variety of sources such as Kafka,
  MongoDB and Amazon S3.
- Perform complex analytical queries regardless of data complexity, structure
  and size.
- Perform interactive computing on large volumes of data using SQL.
- Build web or mobile applications with sophisticated analytics capabilities.

Here are some example applications you can build using Rockset API:

- Personalized Shopping Experiences: Leverage data from many customer
  touchpoints, such as social media, web and app usage, customer support
  tickets and customer reviews, to build personalized shopping experiences.
- Automated Fraud Detection: Create and monitor automated fraud detection
  systems that ingest and analyze various types of data in real-time to detect
  anomalous user behaviors.
- Smart IoT: Create a connected infrastructure that lets you develop and deploy
  intelligent applications that can understand, store and analyze IoT data
  streams.
- Machine Learning: Build applications that can quickly access, prepare and
  analyze data used for predictive analysis.
- Log Management and Analytics: Collect, monitor and analyze log data from
  various sources to monitor system performance and alert on anomalies.
