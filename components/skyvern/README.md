# Overview

The Skyvern API allows users to manage and automate infrastructure tasks, primarily focusing on security and compliance in cloud environments. With its robust set of endpoints, developers can programmatically control security policies, audit systems, and ensure compliance across their tech stacks. Utilizing this API in Pipedream enables users to integrate these capabilities with numerous other services, streamlining operations and enhancing security measures efficiently.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Compliance Reporting**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream that triggers every week to fetch compliance reports from Skyvern. These reports can then automatically be sent to Slack to keep team members updated or stored in Google Drive for record-keeping.

- **Real-time Security Alerting**: Create a Pipedream workflow that uses Skyvern's ability to monitor security settings. Whenever a potential security issue is detected, use Pipedream to send real-time alerts via email or SMS through integrations like SendGrid or Twilio, ensuring that your team can react quickly to threats.

- **Policy Update Distribution**: Leverage Skyvern's API to fetch the latest security policies and use Pipedream to distribute updates to relevant team members via Microsoft Teams or Slack. This ensures everyone is on the same page, maintaining a high security standard across all departments.
