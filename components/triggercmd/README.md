# Overview

TRIGGERcmd is a cloud service that allows you to execute commands on your computers remotely through a REST API or via voice command with smart home integrators. With Pipedream's integration capabilities, you can create custom workflows to automate tasks across various apps and services. For instance, you could set up a serverless workflow to trigger scripts on your computer when specific events occur in other apps, such as receiving an email, a new GitHub commit, or a scheduled timer.

# Example Use Cases

- **Remote System Administration**: Trigger virus scans or system updates on your remote machines when a security alert is received from an app like SentinelOne. This ensures that your systems are always up to date with the latest security patches without manual intervention.

- **DevOps Automation**: Automatically run deployment scripts on your server when a new commit is pushed to a specific branch in your GitHub repository. This workflow can streamline your CI/CD pipeline, making the deployment process more efficient and error-free.

- **Smart Home Integration**: Link TRIGGERcmd with smart home apps like SmartThings to execute commands on your PC in response to smart home triggers, such as turning off your computer when your smart thermostat detects you've left home, or starting a backup when your smart lock is activated at night.
