# Overview

The Helium (Console) API serves as a gateway to the Helium network, a decentralized blockchain network for IoT devices. It enables you to interact with the network by fetching device data, managing hotspots, and tracking sensor activity. With Pipedream, you can automate workflows that respond to this data in real-time. This allows for the creation of complex IoT applications, such as automated alerts, data analysis, and integration with other services for enhanced functionality.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time IoT Data Processing and Alerting**: Using the Helium (Console) API on Pipedream, you can set up a workflow that listens for data from your IoT sensors and processes it instantly. If the data meets certain conditions – say, a temperature threshold is exceeded – you can automatically trigger notifications via email, SMS, or messaging platforms.

- **IoT Data Aggregation and Analysis**: Collect data from multiple IoT devices on the Helium network. With Pipedream, feed this data into analytics tools or databases like Google Sheets or Amazon S3. Perform real-time analysis and visualize trends to make informed decisions about your IoT infrastructure.

- **Automated Device Management**: Create a workflow that monitors the status of your Helium devices. When a device goes offline, automatically attempt a remote reboot and, if that fails, notify your maintenance team via a task in project management tools like Jira or Asana.
