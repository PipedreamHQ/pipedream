# Overview

The Retool API allows you to extend the capabilities of Retool, a platform designed for building internal tools quickly. By leveraging the Retool API on Pipedream, you can automate interactions with your Retool applications, manage users, and trigger queries programmatically. This serves to enhance the way your internal tools interact with other services, streamlines workflow automation, and enables dynamic control over your Retool environment through external triggers.

## Example Use Cases

- **Automated User Provisioning**
  Create a serverless workflow on Pipedream that listens for new employee records from an HR system like BambooHR. Once a new employee is detected, the workflow uses the Retool API to create a user account in your Retool application, ensuring seamless access control and onboarding.

- **Dynamic Query Triggering**
  Set up a workflow that reacts to webhook events from GitHub whenever a new commit is pushed. The Pipedream pipeline could trigger a specific Retool query that updates a dashboard within Retool to reflect the latest code changes, aiding in real-time monitoring and reporting for development teams.

- **Cross-App Data Sync**
  Develop a Pipedream workflow that connects Retool to a CRM like Salesforce. Whenever a new contact is added in Salesforce, Pipedream can invoke a Retool API to run a query that updates a customer support dashboard in Retool, keeping all teams aligned with the latest customer data.
