# Overview

Retool is a platform that makes it faster to build internal tools with a drag-and-drop interface. The Retool API allows you to programmatically manage various aspects of your Retool applications, such as triggering queries, updating apps, or retrieving data from your custom tools. In Pipedream, you can utilize this API to automate workflows between Retool and other apps, creating powerful integrations that streamline your internal processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync User Data from CRM to Retool**: Automatically update user data in a Retool app when a new contact is added to your CRM platform (e.g., Salesforce). This keeps your internal tools in sync with real-time customer information.

- **Process Form Submissions with Retool and Send Emails**: When a user submits a form within a Retool app, trigger a workflow in Pipedream to process the submission. Then, use an email service like SendGrid to send a customized email based on the form data.

- **Schedule Database Backups to Retool**: Use Pipedream's built-in cron job feature to periodically trigger a Retool query that backs up your database to a storage service like Amazon S3. This automates the backup process and ensures your data is always safely stored.
