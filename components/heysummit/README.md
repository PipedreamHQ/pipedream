# Overview

The HeySummit API lets you automate and integrate your event management tasks with ease. With this API, you can access attendee data, control event schedules, retrieve talk details, and more. By using Pipedream's serverless platform, you can construct workflows that trigger actions in other apps or services whenever specific events occur in HeySummit. This opens up a myriad of possibilities for event organizers to streamline processes, improve attendee engagement, and gain valuable insights from their events.

# Example Use Cases

- **Attendee Registration to Email Campaigns**: When a new attendee registers for an event on HeySummit, automatically add them to an email marketing campaign on Mailchimp. This keeps participants engaged with regular updates and personalized content.

- **Speaker Coordination Workflow**: Upon the addition of a new speaker to an event in HeySummit, trigger a sequence of tasks such as sending a welcome email through SendGrid, creating a task in Asana for the event coordinator, and updating a Google Sheet with the speaker's details for streamlined team coordination.

- **Post-Event Feedback Collection**: After an event ends, automatically send a feedback survey link from Typeform to all attendees via Twilio SMS. This immediate request for feedback can lead to higher response rates and more valuable insights for future event improvements.
