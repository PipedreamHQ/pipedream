# Overview

The Wistia API lets you dive deep into video analytics, manage your media library, and automate video workflows. It's great for developers aiming to extend the functionality of their Wistia-hosted content. When used within Pipedream, you can integrate Wistia with countless other apps and services to create robust automations. You could, for instance, update a CRM with video view data, send custom email alerts based on viewer behavior, or even synchronize video uploads with a content management system.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Video Publication Announcements**: When a new video is uploaded to Wistia, you can automatically post a message to Slack or send an email via SendGrid to notify your team or subscribers, keeping everyone informed about new content without manual intervention.

- **Sync Video Engagement Data with a CRM**: Capture engagement data from your viewers and feed it into Salesforce or HubSpot. This could enable sales teams to better understand customer interests based on which videos they're watching and how they interact with the content, helping to tailor follow-up communications more effectively.

- **Trigger Workflows from Video Events**: Use video events like a play or pause action to trigger specific workflows. For example, if a viewer pauses a video at a certain point, it could trigger an email through Mailgun with more information on the topic discussed at that time stamp, offering a more interactive and responsive viewing experience.
