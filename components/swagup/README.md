# Overview

The SwagUp API allows you to automate the creation and distribution of swag packs. You can programmatically design swag items, assemble them into packs, and manage orders and inventory. Integrating SwagUp with Pipedream opens up endless possibilities for sending personalized swag to customers, employees, or event attendees efficiently, aligning this delightful process with various triggers from other apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Milestone Rewards**: Trigger a SwagUp pack order when a user reaches a new level in your service's reward program. Connect SwagUp to a CRM like Salesforce, so once a user achieves the milestone, Salesforce sends an event to Pipedream, which then calls SwagUp to dispatch the reward.

- **Welcome Kits for New Employees**: Onboard new hires with a custom swag pack. Set up a workflow where an HR platform like BambooHR, upon adding a new employee, triggers a SwagUp API request through Pipedream to send out a branded welcome kit, making the new employee feel part of the team from day one.

- **Event Attendee Thank-Yous**: After an event concludes, send attendees a thank-you pack. Use an event management platform like Eventbrite to track registrations and attendance. When an event ends, Pipedream listens for the trigger, and then the SwagUp API is called to send swag to participants as a token of appreciation, enhancing post-event engagement.
