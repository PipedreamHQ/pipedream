# Overview

The Time Tracker by eBillity API lets you interact with a robust time tracking system for invoicing and payroll. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to create automated workflows that simplify how you manage time entries, client billing, and employee payroll processes. By connecting Time Tracker with other apps on Pipedream, you can automate data syncing, generate reports, and trigger actions, streamlining your time tracking operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Time Entries with Accounting Software**: Automatically sync recorded time entries from Time Tracker to your accounting software, like QuickBooks or Xero. When a new time entry is created in Time Tracker, the workflow triggers an action that creates a corresponding record in your accounting system for real-time invoice updating.

- **Time Entry Approval Notifications**: Set up a workflow that monitors time entries for approval status. When a time entry is approved within Time Tracker, it triggers a Pipedream workflow that sends a notification via email or a messaging app, like Slack, to inform the relevant personnel or the employee who logged the hours.

- **Automated Payroll Processing**: Create a workflow that aggregates approved time entries at the end of a pay period. The workflow can then interact with payroll services such as Gusto or ADP to automatically process payments based on the approved time data, reducing manual payroll efforts and the risk of errors.
