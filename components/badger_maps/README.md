# Overview

The Badger Maps API offers interaction with a platform designed for field sales; it allows you to optimize routes, manage territories, and explore customer locations. Combining the Badger Maps API with Pipedream's capabilities enables the automation of sales processes, integration with CRM systems, and enhancement of data analytics. You can build workflows that respond to events in real-time, sync data across multiple platforms, and create custom triggers and actions that cater specifically to your sales strategies.

# Example Use Cases

- **Territory Data Sync with CRM**: Automatically sync new and updated customer information from Badger Maps to a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. This ensures that the sales team has the latest data at hand without manual updates.

- **Optimized Routing for Calendar Events**: Before a salesperson's day begins, trigger a workflow that optimizes their route based on their Google Calendar events. The workflow fetches the day's appointments, sends the locations to Badger Maps for optimization, and then updates the calendar with the best route.

- **Lead Qualification and Prioritization**: Integrate Badger Maps with a lead generation tool like LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms. When a new lead comes in, use Badger Maps to analyze the lead's location data and prioritize them based on their proximity to existing customers or territories.
