# Overview

The Levity API provides a platform for creating AI-powered workflows that can classify images, text, and data with ease. Using this API in Pipedream, you can automate decision-making processes, enhance data categorization, and streamline content moderation by leveraging machine learning models. It integrates smoothly within Pipedream's serverless environment, allowing you to build complex workflows without spinning up a single server.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Support Ticket Categorization**: Build a workflow where incoming support emails are classified by Levity's AI, and then routed to the appropriate department or person in your organization using the Gmail or Zendesk Pipedream app.

- **Real-time Content Moderation for Social Media**: Create a Pipedream workflow that utilizes Levity's API to moderate user-generated content on social platforms. When new posts or comments are detected by a social media trigger, such as the Twitter Pipedream app, Levity can assess them for inappropriate content, and actions are taken based on the classifications, such as flagging, removing, or escalating the content.

- **Enhanced CRM Data Enrichment**: Use Levity API within a Pipedream workflow to analyze and enrich contact records in your CRM. When a new contact is added to your CRM, such as Salesforce, trigger a workflow that uses Levity to classify the contact based on the interaction history or uploaded documents, optimizing your sales or marketing strategy.
