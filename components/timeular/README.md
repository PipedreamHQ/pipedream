# Overview

The Timeular API lets you track, analyze, and manage your time directly, integrating your time tracking activities with other apps and automations. With Pipedream, you can harness the API to create custom workflows, such as triggering events based on time tracking data, syncing time entries with project management tools, or even automating invoicing processes based on tracked time. It's about connecting Timeular's detailed time tracking capabilities with other services to streamline productivity and reporting.

# Example Use Cases

- **Synchronize Time Tracking with Project Management:** Automatically create tasks in Asana or Trello when a new time entry is started in Timeular. This keeps your project management tools up to date with the tasks you're actively working on.

- **Time Tracking Data to Spreadsheets:** Send detailed Timeular tracking data to Google Sheets or Excel for further analysis and reporting. This workflow can be scheduled to run at regular intervals, ensuring your spreadsheets always reflect the latest data.

- **Automated Invoicing Based on Time Entries:** Connect Timeular with an invoicing app like QuickBooks to generate invoices based on the time you've tracked. When a time entry is stopped, calculate the billable amount and create an invoice draft, ready for review and send-off.
