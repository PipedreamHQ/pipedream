# Overview

Aidaform is a service that lets you craft forms for a variety of purposes, from surveys to job applications. By leveraging the Aidaform API on Pipedream, you can automate interactions with your forms and the data they collect. This means instant processes for form responses, seamless data integration with other apps, and dynamic form management. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows that trigger actions in other services like CRMs, email marketing tools, or databases whenever a new form submission is received.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contact Registration**: When a new contact form submission comes in via Aidaform, Pipedream can catch that event and automatically add or update the contact in a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. This removes the need for manual data entry and ensures your CRM is always up-to-date with the latest leads or inquiries.

- **Survey Response Aggregation**: After collecting responses from an Aidaform survey, Pipedream can aggregate the data and send it to a Google Sheet for easy analysis. You can also leverage this workflow to trigger notifications via Slack or email, alerting your team to new responses or feedback that require immediate attention.

- **Event Registration and Confirmation**: Use Aidaform for event sign-ups and integrate Pipedream to manage the registration process. When a participant registers, Pipedream can add them to an event management app like Eventbrite, send a personalized confirmation email via SendGrid, and even update a Mailchimp list to keep them informed about event updates.
