# Overview

The Welcome API provides tools for organizing and executing engaging virtual events. Integrating this API with Pipedream allows users to automate event-related workflows, enrich attendee management, and generate customized interactions based on attendee behavior. Whether it's syncing event data to other platforms, automating email communications, or gathering feedback post-event, the Welcome API, via Pipedream, opens a wide spectrum of possibilities to streamline event operations and enhance attendee engagement.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Event Registration and Email Confirmation**: Using the Welcome API with Pipedream, automate the event registration process by adding new registrants to an event in Welcome whenever they sign up through a form on your website (like Google Forms). Then, trigger an automated email via SendGrid to confirm their registration and provide event details.

- **Sync Event Attendees to CRM**: After an event, automatically sync attendee details from Welcome to a CRM platform like Salesforce. This workflow can be set to trigger at the end of an event, ensuring that all attendee interactions and engagement levels are captured and utilized for future marketing and sales strategies.

- **Post-Event Feedback Collection**: Automate the distribution of feedback surveys through platforms like Typeform or Google Forms to attendees right after an event concludes. Use the Welcome API to identify attendees who participated actively, and tailor the feedback forms based on their activities during the event to gather actionable insights.
