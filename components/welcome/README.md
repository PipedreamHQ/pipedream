# Overview

The Welcome API enables you to create, manage, and enhance event experiences seamlessly. With this API, you can automate event setup, participant management, and real-time updates. On Pipedream, you can integrate Welcome with other popular tools, streamlining workflows related to event planning and execution, thereby enhancing attendee engagement and operational efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Event Creation and Setup**: Automatically create events in Welcome whenever new events are scheduled in Google Calendar. This ensures that your event setups are immediately mirrored and managed without manual intervention.

- **Dynamic Attendee Management**: Sync attendee lists from event platforms like Eventbrite to Welcome. Whenever a ticket is sold on Eventbrite, the attendee's details are automatically added to the corresponding event in Welcome, keeping your participant list up-to-date in real-time.

- **Real-time Feedback Collection**: After an event concludes, use Pipedream to automatically trigger a feedback survey email to all attendees via SendGrid. The responses can then be collected and stored in a Google Sheet for easy analysis and follow-up.
