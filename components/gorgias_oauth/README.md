# Overview

Gorgias is a helpdesk platform that centralizes customer interactions and automates common support tasks. Utilizing the Gorgias API on Pipedream allows you to streamline customer service processes by creating automated workflows. With these integrations, you can sync customer data, manage tickets, automate responses, and track support metrics, effectively turning Gorgias into an engine for customer support automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Support Tickets with CRM**: Automatically create or update customer profiles in a CRM like Salesforce when a new support ticket is created in Gorgias. This ensures that customer support interactions are logged and accessible for sales or support teams, providing a 360-degree view of customer communications.

- **Automate Customer Satisfaction Surveys**: Following the resolution of a support ticket, trigger a workflow that sends out a customer satisfaction survey using a survey platform such as Typeform. The responses can be collected and analyzed for insights into the support experience, driving improvements in service quality.

- **Slack Notifications for Urgent Tickets**: Set up a workflow that monitors support tickets for specific keywords or tags indicating urgency, and automatically sends a notification to a designated Slack channel. This enables immediate team collaboration to resolve high-priority issues faster.
