# Overview

The Zoho Mail API enables developers to integrate their applications with the
Zoho Mail platform, allowing them access to a wide range of email and
collaboration features. With the API, developers can build sophisticated email
applications that manage mailing lists, send and receive automated emails,
analyze customer data, manage customer accounts, and more.

The following are a few examples of what you can build using the Zoho Mail API:

- Create mailing lists and manage contacts
- Set up automated mailing sequences
- Analyze customer engagement data
- Access customer accounts and manage subscriptions
- Automate the sending of outgoing emails
- Receive and manage incoming emails
- Track email delivery rates and performance
- Connect with 3rd party applications and integrate with other services
- Create and manage custom customer fields and profiles
- Streamline customer interactions with automated follow up emails
- Automatically respond to incoming messages
- Create and manage user groups
- Create and manage custom address books and contact lists

## Getting Started

1. First, sign up for Pipedream at [https://pipedream.com](https://pipedream.com).
2. [Create a new workflow](https://pipedream.com/new).
3. Select a [trigger](/workflows/steps/triggers/) for your workflow (for example, HTTP or Cron).
4. [Add a new step](/workflows/steps/) and search for "Zoho Mail". This will display [actions](/components#actions) associated with the Zoho Mail app. You can choose to either "Run Node.js code with Zoho Mail" or select one of the prebuilt actions for performing common API operations.
5. Once you've added a step, press the **Connect Zoho Mail** button near the top. If this is your first time authorizing Pipedream's access to your Zoho Mail account, you'll be prompted to accept that access, and Pipedream will store the authorization grant to enable the workflow to access the API. If you've already linked a Zoho Mail account via Pipedream, pressing **Connect Zoho Mail** will list any existing accounts you've linked. 

Once you've connected your account, you can run your workflow and fetch data from the API. You can change any of the code associated with this step, changing the API endpoint you'd like to retrieve data from, or modifying the results in any way.
