# Overview

The Cyberimpact API allows for the seamless integration of email marketing tools into your custom workflows, enabling automation of contact management, campaign tracking, and subscriber interaction. Using this API with Pipedream, you can automate the sync of subscriber lists, trigger email campaigns based on specific actions, and analyze campaign performances, all within a serverless environment. This can significantly cut the time spent on routine marketing tasks and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of your marketing strategies.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Subscriber Syncing**: Create a workflow that listens for new sign-ups on your website (using a webhook or your preferred sign-up tool). Once a new user registers, automatically add them to a specified Cyberimpact mailing list. This keeps your subscriber list up-to-date without manual intervention.

- **Triggered Email Campaigns from E-Commerce Events**: Set up a workflow that catches webhook notifications from your e-commerce platform (like Shopify) for events like a completed purchase. Use this trigger to send a tailored thank you email from Cyberimpact, or enroll the customer in a post-purchase education sequence.

- **Campaign Performance Reporting to Google Sheets**: After sending out a campaign, use Cyberimpact's API to collect campaign performance data. Then, employ Pipedream's built-in Google Sheets actions to push this data into a spreadsheet. Here, it can automatically update dashboards or reports, making performance analysis accessible and real-time.
