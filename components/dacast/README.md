# Overview

Dacast's API gives you the power to manage live and on-demand video content. With this API, you can automate content creation, update settings, and pull analytics, all of which can be seamlessly integrated with Pipedream workflows. Use it to synchronize your video content with other databases, notify subscribers about new videos, or generate real-time alerts based on streaming performance metrics.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Video Content Syncing with CMS**: Integrate Dacast with a Content Management System (CMS) like WordPress. Whenever a new video is uploaded to Dacast, trigger a workflow that creates or updates a post in WordPress with the video details and embed code, keeping your site's content fresh and in sync with your streaming service.

- **Subscriber Notifications via Email or Messaging Apps**: Connect Dacast to an email service like SendGrid or a messaging app like Slack. Set up a workflow to detect when a new live stream starts or a new video is uploaded to Dacast and instantly send out a notification with viewing details to a list of subscribers or a Slack channel, keeping your audience engaged and informed.

- **Real-Time Streaming Analytics with Dashboard Integration**: Pair Dacast with a dashboard platform like Google Data Studio. Create a workflow that fetches streaming performance data from Dacast and sends it to Google Sheets, which feeds into Data Studio, providing live analytics visualization for monitoring and decision-making.
