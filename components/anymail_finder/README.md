# Overview

The Anymail Finder API lets you find and verify email addresses. Using Anymail Finder, you can look up emails by providing a person's name and their company's domain, or simply validate if an existing email is deliverable. When used in Pipedream, this API unlocks possibilities for automating outreach, enriching customer data, or cleaning your email lists. You can set up workflows that respond to various triggers (like a new lead in your CRM) and perform email lookups or verifications, streamlining tasks that would otherwise require manual intervention.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Enrichment**: When a new lead is added to your CRM (e.g., Salesforce), automatically find and verify the lead's email address using Anymail Finder. This ensures that your sales team always has accurate contact information.

- **Email Verification for Newsletter Sign-ups**: Once someone signs up for your newsletter, use Anymail Finder to verify the email before adding it to your mailing list. This can cut down on bounce rates and maintain the health of your email campaigns.

- **Automated Outreach**: For a list of prospects stored in Google Sheets, set up a workflow that iterates through each row, uses Anymail Finder to find the email address associated with the prospect's name and domain, and then sends a personalized outreach email using a service like SendGrid.
