# Overview

Lifx is a platform that allows developers to build lightbulb-connected
applications. With the Lifx API, you can control the color, brightness, and
power of Lifx-connected lightbulbs. You can also create schedules and routines
to automate your lightbulbs. Some examples of things you can build with the
Lifx API include:

- A lightbulb that turns blue when it rains
- A lightbulb that turns red when your favorite team scores
- A lightbulb that gradually wakes you up in the morning
- A lightbulb that dims when you start watching a movie
- A lightbulb that turns off when you leave the house
