# Overview

The Api Void API provides a suite of tools for supply chain management, including tracking shipments, managing inventory, and overseeing manufacturing processes. With Pipedream, these capabilities can be integrated into automated workflows, allowing users to connect Api Void with a myriad of other services and apps to streamline operations, trigger notifications, synchronize data, and create custom analytics dashboards for real-time insights.

# Example Use Cases

- **Order Tracking System Automation**: Monitor your shipments by setting up a workflow that triggers when a new order is placed. Use Api Void API to track the shipment status, and then update the customer proactively with email or SMS notifications via apps like SendGrid or Twilio when their order status changes.

- **Inventory Level Alerts**: Create a workflow that periodically checks inventory levels using Api Void's API. When stock for a particular item falls below a certain threshold, it automatically generates a purchase order and sends it to the supplier, and simultaneously alerts the inventory manager through Slack or email.

- **Manufacturing Process Updates to CRMs**: Integrate Api Void with CRM platforms like Salesforce or HubSpot. Whenever a manufacturing milestone is reached, trigger a workflow to update the related customer record with the latest status, ensuring the sales and customer service teams have the most current information to share with clients.
