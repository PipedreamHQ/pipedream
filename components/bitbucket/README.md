# Overview

With the BitBucket API, you can programmatically interact with BitBucket, via
REST calls. This allows you to build apps and integrations on top of BitBucket,
customize and automate your workflows, and much more.

Here are some examples of what you can build with the BitBucket API:

- Build integrations with 3rd party applications, such as CI/CD tools, chat
  applications, etc.
- Create custom workflows and automate tasks
- Build applications that interact with BitBucket (for example, a tool that
  helps you find repositories or users)
- and much more!
