# Overview

Everhour is a time tracking API that allows you to monitor project hours and manage tasks effectively. With Pipedream, you can automate workflows by integrating Everhour with various apps, streamlining time entry, syncing with project management tools, and generating custom reports. Whether you're consolidating time tracking data for invoicing or keeping project budgets in check, Everhour and Pipedream make a powerful duo for automating your time tracking and project management processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Time Entry Automation**: Triggered when a task is marked complete in a project management tool like Asana, this workflow automatically logs time in Everhour for that task. It ensures accurate and timely updates to the time tracking system, without manual entry.

- **Project Budget Monitoring**: Monitor project hours and budgets by setting up a workflow that sends a Slack alert when a project reaches a certain percentage of its allocated budget. This workflow uses the Everhour API to track time spent and calculates budget usage, keeping team members informed in real-time.

- **Invoice Generation and Delivery**: At the end of a billing cycle, automatically generate an invoice based on tracked time from Everhour, and send it to clients via email (using SendGrid or another email service). This workflow can also attach detailed time reports, ensuring clients receive transparent and accurate billing information.
