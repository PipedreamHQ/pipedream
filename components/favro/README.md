# Overview

The Favro API gives you the power to automate and integrate your project management tools with a host of other services. With Favro and Pipedream, you can create custom workflows to synchronize tasks, update cards, manage boards, and collaborate more effectively across your organization. Whether you're syncing with a CRM, triggering notifications, or generating reports, Pipedream's serverless platform makes it simple to connect Favro with other apps to streamline your processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Favro Cards with Google Calendar Events**: When a new card is created in Favro, automatically create a corresponding event in Google Calendar. This ensures that tasks and deadlines from Favro are reflected in your schedule, keeping everyone on track.

- **Post Slack Notifications for Favro Card Updates**: Set up a workflow where updates to cards in Favro trigger notifications in a specific Slack channel. This keeps your team informed in real-time about task progress or changes, fostering better communication and collaboration.

- **Create Favro Cards from Email**: Automate the creation of Favro cards from incoming emails. For example, when an email tagged with a specific label arrives in Gmail, a new card is created in a designated Favro board, converting customer feedback or inquiries into actionable tasks.
