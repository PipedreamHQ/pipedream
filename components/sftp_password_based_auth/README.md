# Overview

SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is a network protocol that provides secure
file transfers over secure shell (SSH) connections. It is an extension of the
Secure Shell protocol, designed for secure file exchange between hosts. A user
can securely transfer files between systems without having to worry about
external threats, as the protocol is encrypted and authenticated.

With the SFTP API, you can build applications that securely transfer data, such
as files and documents, between two different systems. Some example
applications include:

- Secure document sharing between two systems
- Secure file synchronization between two systems
- Secure backups of data over the network
- Secure transfers of large files
- Secure uploads and downloads of data
- Media streaming between two systems
