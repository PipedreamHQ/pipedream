# Overview

## What is SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)

SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is a network protocol that provides secure file transfers over secure shell (SSH) connections. It is an extension of the Secure Shell protocol, designed for secure file exchange between hosts. A user can securely transfer files between systems without having to worry about external threats, as the protocol is encrypted and authenticated.

## What can you build with the SFTP API

With the SFTP API, you can build applications that securely transfer data, such as files and documents, between two different systems.

Some example applications include:

- Secure document sharing between two systems
- Secure file synchronization between two systems
- Secure backups of data over the network
- Secure transfers of large files
- Secure uploads and downloads of data
- Media streaming between two systems
