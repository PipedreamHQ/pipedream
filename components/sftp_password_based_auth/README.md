# Overview

SFTP on Pipedream enables secure file management on remote servers directly from your workflows. Utilize this app to automate file uploads, downloads, and synchronization tasks between your systems and SFTP servers. Implement robust data pipelines or deploy content to web servers without manual intervention, all while maintaining a high level of security with password-based authentication.

# Example Use Cases

- **Scheduled Data Backups**: Automatically back up critical data from your local systems to an SFTP server. Set a cron trigger in Pipedream to periodically upload files, ensuring your backups are both current and off-site.

- **E-commerce Order Processing**: When a new order is placed via a platform like Shopify, use Pipedream's Shopify trigger to fetch order details, generate invoices, and securely transfer them to an SFTP server for archiving and further processing.

- **Website Content Deployment**: Set up a Git-triggered workflow that responds to commits or tags. When updates are pushed to your repository, Pipedream can fetch the latest content and deploy it to your web server via SFTP, streamlining your deployment process.
