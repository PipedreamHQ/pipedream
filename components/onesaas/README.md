# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Multi-Channel Customer Support Ticketing**: Create a workflow where a new ticket submission in Zendesk triggers an automated notification in Slack. Use the 1SaaS API to log the ticket details in a Google Sheet, enabling a cross-functional team to track and handle customer support across platforms efficiently.

- **E-commerce Order Processing and Inventory Management**: Set up a workflow that detects new orders from Shopify using the 1SaaS API. Automatically create an invoice in QuickBooks, update inventory levels, and send a personalized confirmation email to the customer via SendGrid, streamlining the order-to-fulfillment process.

- **Marketing Campaign Lead Synchronization**: Build a workflow where new leads captured via a Facebook Ads campaign are instantly added to a Mailchimp list using the 1SaaS API, and simultaneously logged into a CRM like Salesforce. This ensures real-time lead nurturing and accurate tracking of campaign performance.
