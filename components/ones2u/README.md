# Overview

The 1S2U API provides SMS messaging functionality, enabling you to send texts globally from your Pipedream workflows. With this integration, you can automate notifications, alerts, and communication with users or staff, streamlining your outreach efforts. Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform allows you to create complex workflows, triggering SMS sends based on events from various apps or custom logic.

# Example Use Cases

- **Order Confirmation Texts**: When an order is placed through your e-commerce platform, use the 1S2U API in Pipedream to send a confirmation SMS to the customer, ensuring they receive immediate order details and peace of mind.

- **Appointment Reminders**: Connect your scheduling app to Pipedream and set up a workflow that automatically sends reminder SMS messages to clients a day before their appointment, reducing no-shows and improving customer experience.

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: For added security, integrate 1S2U with your authentication flow in Pipedream to send a one-time password (OTP) via SMS when a user attempts to log in.
