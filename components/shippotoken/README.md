# Overview

The Shippo API lets you streamline and automate a wide range of shipping tasks from creating labels to tracking packages. With Pipedream, you can connect Shippo to various other services and trigger actions based on shipment statuses, rates, and other shipping events. Automate notifications, sync tracking data with customer databases, or kick off custom logistics workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Shipping Notifications**: Trigger an email or SMS to customers using services like SendGrid or Twilio when a package is shipped, out for delivery, or delivered. This enhances customer service by providing timely updates.

- **E-commerce Order Fulfillment**: Connect Shippo to an e-commerce platform like Shopify. When a new order is placed, automatically generate shipping labels and customs documents, then update the order status with the tracking number.

- **Inventory Management**: When a shipment is marked as delivered, use Pipedream to trigger an inventory update in a database like Airtable or Google Sheets, ensuring inventory counts are accurate and up-to-date.
