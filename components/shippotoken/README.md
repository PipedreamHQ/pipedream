# Overview

Shippo's API allows developers to quickly integrate their own software with
shipping and tracking systems. With the API, developers can create applications
that expand the capabilities of shipping and tracking services. Here are a few
examples of what you could build with the Shippo API:

- Automatically create shipping labels for your ecommerce business
- Monitor incoming shipments
- Get real-time tracking updates for your customers
- Automatically compare different shipping services and get the best rate
