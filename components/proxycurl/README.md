# Overview

The Proxycurl API is a tool for scraping LinkedIn data, enabling users to extract professional information from LinkedIn profiles and company pages. When integrated with Pipedream's serverless platform, Proxycurl can automate the collection of LinkedIn data, which can be used for lead generation, market research, or recruitment. Pipedream's capabilities allow users to create workflows that respond to various triggers, process the data with Proxycurl, and then output it to desired destinations or further manipulate it with other apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Enrich CRM with LinkedIn Data**: Automatically enrich contact records in your CRM when new leads are added. Proxycurl can fetch detailed professional information, which can then be sent to the CRM to update contact profiles.

- **LinkedIn Lead Generation**: Trigger a workflow when a new form is submitted on your website. Use Proxycurl to find LinkedIn profiles matching the submission info and create a list of potential leads to be added to an email marketing tool like Mailchimp for outreach campaigns.

- **Automated Recruitment Pipeline**: Set up a workflow to monitor job application submissions. Use Proxycurl to pull LinkedIn profiles for applicants and filter qualified candidates based on their work history and skills. Candidates can then be moved to an ATS like Greenhouse or sent to a Google Sheet for review.
