# Overview

The Smarty API, previously known as SmartyStreets, provides powerful location data services, including address validation, geocoding, and autocomplete for addresses. Integrating Smarty with Pipedream allows you to automate processes that require address verification or geolocation data, enriching datasets, improving delivery accuracy, and enhancing user experiences through auto-complete suggestions. By leveraging Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows that react to events, process data in real-time, and connect Smarty with hundreds of other services without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Address Validation for E-commerce Checkout**: Automate the validation of shipping addresses during the checkout process of an e-commerce app. When a new order is placed, trigger a Pipedream workflow that uses the Smarty API to confirm that the address is valid, reducing shipping errors and improving customer satisfaction.

- **Geocoding Addresses from CRM Entries**: When a new contact is added to a CRM like HubSpot, automatically geocode the address and store the coordinates using the Smarty API. This data can be used to visualize customer locations on a map or for route optimization for sales reps.

- **Autocomplete Address in User Sign-up Forms**: Improve user experience by adding autocomplete to address fields in sign-up forms. Connect a Pipedream workflow to your form submissions, use the Smarty API to fetch autocomplete suggestions, and dynamically update the form field to help users quickly complete address information.
