# Overview

The CampaignHQ API offers tools to engage in political campaigns, supporting services like phone calls, texts, and surveys. With Pipedream, you can link CampaignHQ's capabilities with other apps to automate your political campaign's engagement and data management. Using Pipedream's serverless platform, you can trigger workflows on events, process and analyze incoming data, and respond in real-time, all without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Volunteer Recruitment Notifications**: When new volunteers sign up via a form on your website, trigger a Pipedream workflow that automatically sends their details to CampaignHQ to queue a welcome phone call or text, ensuring a personal touch is added to your campaign outreach instantaneously.

- **Sync Survey Responses to a CRM**: Collect survey responses through CampaignHQ's API, then use a Pipedream workflow to parse the data and sync it with your CRM platform, like Salesforce. This can help you to maintain an up-to-date record of constituent opinions and streamline follow-up communication strategies.

- **Coordinate Event Invitations**: Use CampaignHQ to send out mass invites to a political rally or fundraiser. With Pipedream, set up a workflow that listens for RSVPs, automatically updates your event management app (such as Eventbrite), and sends a personalized confirmation with event details using a service like SendGrid.
