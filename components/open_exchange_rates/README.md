# Overview

The Open Exchange Rates API provides real-time and historical exchange rates for currencies worldwide, which enables you to retrieve the latest currency data for any purpose like financial reporting, pricing products in multiple currencies, or converting currency for international transactions. In Pipedream, you can tap into this API to create workflows that automate currency-related tasks, enrich data with current exchange rates, and trigger actions based on currency fluctuations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Currency Conversion for E-Commerce**: Sync currency rates daily to your e-commerce platform using Pipedream's scheduled triggers. Convert product prices from your base currency to multiple currencies and update the pricing on your website accordingly.

- **Financial Reporting**: Use Pipedream to gather and store historical exchange rates data in a data warehouse like Snowflake or Google BigQuery. Combine this with your financial data to generate accurate multi-currency financial reports.

- **Alert System for Currency Fluctuations**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that monitors the Open Exchange Rates API for significant currency fluctuations. When a threshold is crossed, send an alert via email, Slack, or SMS to notify stakeholders of the change.
