# Overview

The WhoisFreaks API offers a way to dig into the riches of domain registration data. With this API, you can retrieve extensive WHOIS records, including registrar details, domain status, creation and expiration dates, and registrant information, among other data. When integrated with Pipedream's serverless platform, you unlock the potential to automate domain research, track domain registrations, monitor changes, and connect insights with other apps for a multitude of purposes.

# Example Workflows

- **Domain Registration Monitoring**: Build a workflow on Pipedream that tracks domain registrations for specific keywords. When a new domain containing the keyword is registered, use WhoisFreaks to fetch WHOIS data and send alerts via Slack or email to the interested parties.

- **Trademark Protection**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to monitor the registration of domains similar to your trademarks. WhoisFreaks can be used to identify potential trademark infringements, and you can connect to a CRM like Salesforce to initiate a follow-up action or legal response.

- **Competitive Intelligence Gathering**: Create a Pipedream workflow to perform regular searches for domains registered by your competitors. Utilize WhoisFreaks API to extract relevant data and compile it into a report, which can be periodically sent to Google Sheets for analysis and shared with your team.
