# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Student Welcome Messages**: Trigger a personalized welcome email via SendGrid whenever a new user enrolls in a course on Zenler. This workflow ensures that every student receives all the necessary information they need to get started, while also adding a personal touch.

- **Course Completion Certificates**: Generate and send a certificate using a service like PDF.co when a student completes a course. This workflow can monitor course completions, create a personalized certificate, and then email it to the student, all without manual intervention.

- **Real-time Course Progress Tracking**: Integrate with a tool like Google Sheets to track student progress in real-time. Each time a student completes a lesson or a module, append their progress to a spreadsheet. This allows for at-a-glance monitoring and can be used to identify students who might need additional support or encouragement.
