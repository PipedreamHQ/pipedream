# Overview

The Help Scout API provides programmatic access to customer support functionalities, allowing the automation of ticketing, customer communication, and reporting tasks. With this API, you can read and send messages, manage conversations, work with mailboxes, create and update customersâ€™ information, and generate reports. Utilizing the API on Pipedream, you can automate workflows that respond to events in Help Scout in real-time, integrate customer support data with other business tools, and streamline support operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Customer Support Data with CRM**: When a new conversation is created or updated in Help Scout, trigger a workflow that adds or updates the customer details in a CRM like Salesforce, keeping both systems in sync.

- **Automate Customer Support Follow-ups**: After a conversation is marked as resolved in Help Scout, launch a Pipedream workflow that automatically sends a follow-up email after a specific period to gather feedback or offer further assistance.

- **Real-Time Support Analytics Dashboard**: Use Pipedream to collect data from Help Scout on conversation statuses, response times, and customer satisfaction. Then, push this data to a dashboard service like Google Sheets or Geckoboard to create a real-time analytics display for your support team.
