# Overview

The CoinMarketCap API delivers real-time and historical cryptocurrency market data, including price, volume, market cap, and much more, for over 9,000 cryptocurrencies. With this data, you can track crypto trends, compare currency performance, or integrate up-to-date information into apps, widgets, or websites. Pipedream's platform enables developers to create automated workflows that can harness the vast array of data from CoinMarketCap to trigger actions, notify stakeholders, or power analytics dashboards.

# Example Use Cases

- **Crypto Market Alert System**: Create a workflow that monitors the price of specific cryptocurrencies and sends alerts via email or SMS when the price drops or rises past certain thresholds. This can be connected to Twilio for SMS alerts or to email services like SendGrid.

- **Portfolio Value Tracker**: Construct a workflow to calculate the total value of a cryptocurrency portfolio by fetching current prices and multiplying by the quantity of each asset held. This data can be sent periodically to a Google Sheet for tracking and historical comparison using Pipedream's Google Sheets integration.

- **Automated Trading Signals**: Develop a system that analyzes the market data from CoinMarketCap, such as price changes and trading volumes, to generate trading signals. These signals can then be used to trigger trades on a connected trading platform or to notify a Discord channel using Pipedream's Discord app integration.
