# Overview

Uploadcare is a file uploading, processing, and delivery platform that provides developers with tools to handle the entire file lifecycle with ease. With its robust API, you can upload files from any device, transform images and documents on-the-fly, and manage digital content with a comprehensive set of features. Integrating Uploadcare with Pipedream allows you to craft workflows that automate file operations and connect them seamlessly with other services, such as CRMs, marketing platforms, and data analysis tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Image Moderation and Posting to Social Media**: When new images are uploaded to Uploadcare, trigger a Pipedream workflow that utilizes image recognition APIs to moderate content. Once approved, automatically resize and optimize the images using Uploadcare's processing capabilities, then post them to social media platforms like Twitter or Instagram.

- **E-Commerce Order Fulfillment Automation**: For an e-commerce platform, use an Uploadcare upload widget to receive customer's customization files at checkout. Trigger a Pipedream workflow that processes these files, attaches them to the relevant order in your e-commerce system (like Shopify), and sends a notification to the fulfillment team with the order details and processed files.

- **Event-Driven Backup to Cloud Storage**: Set up an event listener in Pipedream for new files uploaded to Uploadcare. Upon upload, initiate a workflow that performs any necessary file conversions, then automatically backs up the files to cloud storage solutions such as Amazon S3 or Google Drive, ensuring that business-critical files are always securely stored and accessible.
