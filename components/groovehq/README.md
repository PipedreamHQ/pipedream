# Overview

The GrooveHQ API lets you automate your customer support tasks by interfacing with Groove's ticketing system. With it, you can create, update, and manage support tickets, work with customers' data, and leverage knowledge base articles. Integrate GrooveHQ with Pipedream to trigger workflows on new tickets, synchronize customer information with other business tools, and streamline support operations by automating repetitive tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Ticket Management Automation**: Automatically categorize and assign new tickets in GrooveHQ based on specific keywords or customer data. Use Pipedream to parse incoming tickets, apply logic to determine the appropriate category and assignee, and update the ticket in GrooveHQ.

- **Synchronize Support Tickets with a CRM**: Keep your CRM up-to-date with the latest support interactions by using Pipedream to synchronize ticket information from GrooveHQ to CRM platforms like Salesforce or HubSpot. Whenever a ticket is created or updated in GrooveHQ, the corresponding record in your CRM is automatically updated or created.

- **Customer Feedback Collection**: After a ticket is marked as solved in GrooveHQ, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends a follow-up email to the customer asking for feedback. Use this process to gather valuable insights and funnel them into a Google Sheet or a data analytics tool for review and action.
