# Overview

The RenderForm API empowers you to automate the conversion of HTML forms into static, embeddable forms. By integrating RenderForm with Pipedream, you can streamline the process of capturing responses and integrating them into your data pipeline. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows that trigger on form submissions, pre-fill forms with data from external sources, and connect form data to other apps and services, such as CRMs, email marketing tools, or databases.

# Example Use Cases

- **Dynamic Form Generation and Email Distribution**: Create a Pipedream workflow that triggers whenever a new customer is added to your CRM. Use the customer data to dynamically generate a personalized feedback form with the RenderForm API, and then email the form to the customer using the SendGrid app to collect insights.

- **Survey Data Collection and Analysis**: Build a workflow that triggers on form submission, captures the data via the RenderForm API, and stores the responses in a Google Sheets document. Then, use this data to run analysis or create visualizations that can be presented in company dashboards using Google Data Studio.

- **Automated Support Ticket Creation**: Set up a Pipedream workflow where customer support request forms, generated by RenderForm, feed directly into a ticketing system when submitted. Each submission can create a new ticket in Zendesk automatically, ensuring that no customer query goes unnoticed and your support team can track and respond efficiently.
