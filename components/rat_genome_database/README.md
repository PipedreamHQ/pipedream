# Overview

## Using the Rat Genome Database API

The Rat Genome Database (RGD) is a public, online resource that provides genetic information about the rat. It is a powerful tool for researchers and developers, enabling them to access and use data archived in the RGD database. The RGD API has many uses, from research to data integration, and can help you create useful applications for rat-related data.

Here are some examples of what you can build using the RGD API:

1. Create an application that displays the gene expression profiles of rat genes.

2. Develop a program that uses the search capabilities provided by the RGD API to search rat genetic data.

3. Develop a web-based program that provides genetic analysis tools for use in research.

4. Write a program that uses the RGD API to access sequence information for specific rat genes.

5. Use the RGD API to build an application that can compare genetic codes between species.

6. Create a research project that searches through rat data stored in the RGD database.

7. Design a web application that enables integration of rat gene data into existing databases.

8. Use the RGD API to assemble data on disease models and other research topics.

With the RGD API you can quickly build applications and projects that access, use and analyse rat genetic data. So if you are a researcher looking for a tool to help you tackle a rat-related research project, the RGD API is a great place to start.
