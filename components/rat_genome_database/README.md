# Overview

The Rat Genome Database (RGD) is a public, online resource that provides
genetic information about the rat. It is a powerful tool for researchers and
developers, enabling them to access and use data archived in the RGD database.
The RGD API has many uses, from research to data integration, and can help you
create useful applications for rat-related data.

Here are some examples of what you can build using the RGD API:

- Create an application that displays the gene expression profiles of rat
  genes.
- Develop a program that uses the search capabilities provided by the RGD API
  to search rat genetic data.
- Develop a web-based program that provides genetic analysis tools for use in
  research.
- Write a program that uses the RGD API to access sequence information for
  specific rat genes.
- Use the RGD API to build an application that can compare genetic codes
  between species.
- Create a research project that searches through rat data stored in the RGD
  database.
- Design a web application that enables integration of rat gene data into
  existing databases.
- Use the RGD API to assemble data on disease models and other research topics.

With the RGD API you can quickly build applications and projects that access,
use and analyse rat genetic data. So if you are a researcher looking for a tool
to help you tackle a rat-related research project, the RGD API is a great place
to start.
