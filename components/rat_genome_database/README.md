# Overview

The Rat Genome Database (RGD) API provides access to a wealth of genetic and genomic data related to rats, a key model organism in medical research. Via this API, researchers can query for gene information, phenotypic data, and genomic sequences, creating a treasure trove for geneticists, bioinformaticians, and medical researchers seeking to understand disease pathways and potential treatments. On Pipedream, this can be leveraged to automate data retrieval, sync genetic information with other databases, or trigger workflows based on specific genomic updates or criteria.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Genetic Data Sync**: Sync rat genetic data from RGD to a research database like MongoDB on a regular basis. When new genes or phenotypes are added to RGD, a Pipedream workflow can be triggered, automatically fetching and inserting this data into the MongoDB database, ensuring researchers always have access to the latest data without manual intervention.

- **Disease Research Notification System**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that monitors RGD for updates on specific genes or phenotypic data related to a particular disease. When updates are detected, the workflow sends out email notifications using the SendGrid app to a list of subscribed researchers, keeping them informed of the latest findings and potentially accelerating the pace of medical research.

- **Genomic Data Analysis Pipeline**: Trigger a data analysis pipeline whenever new genomic sequences are released on RGD. A Pipedream workflow could invoke AWS Lambda functions to process and analyze the data, comparing it with human genome datasets from apps like Ensembl or NCBI. The results could then be stored in AWS S3 and a summary report sent to the research team, providing valuable insights into comparative genomics and cross-species disease models.
