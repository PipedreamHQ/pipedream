# Overview

The Invoicing.Plus API allows for streamlined management of invoices, clients, and payments. By integrating this API with Pipedream, users can automate numerous aspects of their invoicing processes, such as creating invoices based on specific triggers, updating client data, and synchronizing payment details in real time. Pipedreamâ€™s capabilities to connect with various other APIs and services enable users to create multifaceted workflows that can enhance productivity, improve accuracy in billing processes, and ensure timely payments.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Generation upon Order Confirmation**: Automatically generate and send invoices when an order is confirmed in an eCommerce platform like Shopify. Use the Shopify trigger in Pipedream to detect new orders, generate an invoice using Invoicing.Plus, and email the invoice to the customer.

- **Client Onboarding and Invoice Setup**: When a new client is added to a CRM like HubSpot, automatically create a corresponding client profile in Invoicing.Plus and set up their initial invoice based on the products or services they are interested in. This can be done by setting up a workflow that triggers on new HubSpot contacts, creates a client in Invoicing.Plus, and issues the invoice.

- **Payment Status Sync and Alerts**: Sync payment statuses across platforms and send alerts through communication tools like Slack when a payment is made or overdue. This involves creating a workflow in Pipedream where payment updates in Invoicing.Plus trigger status updates in your database and notifications are sent out via Slack.
