# Overview

Textline is a powerful tool for managing business text messaging, allowing you to automate conversations, streamline customer support, and engage with your audience efficiently. Using Textline's API on Pipedream, you can trigger workflows from incoming messages, automate responses based on specific criteria, and synchronize communication data with other business tools. This integration can transform your customer interaction by making it more responsive and data-driven.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Ticket Creation**: Automatically create support tickets in tools like Zendesk or Jira when a customer sends a message to your Textline number. This ensures that no customer query goes unnoticed and is promptly addressed by your support team.

- **Survey Distribution and Collection**: After a service interaction, trigger a workflow to send a follow-up survey via Textline. Collect responses automatically and store them in a database like Google Sheets or Airtable for analysis and future improvements.

- **Event Reminder and RSVP**: Send reminders for upcoming events and collect RSVPs through Textline. Use Pipedream to integrate with calendar services like Google Calendar to update event details dynamically based on customer interactions.
