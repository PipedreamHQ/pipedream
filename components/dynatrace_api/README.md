# Overview

The Dynatrace API provides programmatic access to the vast array of monitoring, performance data, and management operations within the Dynatrace software intelligence platform. With this powerful API, you can automate your monitoring tasks, integrate with your CI/CD pipeline for performance testing, setup custom alerting mechanics, and pull valuable insights into application performance and infrastructure health. Leveraging the Dynatrace API in Pipedream workflows lets you connect and orchestrate these operations with hundreds of other services for enhanced DevOps automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Incident Response**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow when Dynatrace detects an anomaly or a threshold breach. The workflow can automatically create an incident in an incident management platform like PagerDuty or Opsgenie, notify the responsible team via Slack or Microsoft Teams, and even execute diagnostic scripts to gather more information.

- **Performance Metrics to Data Warehouse**: Set up a scheduled Pipedream workflow that fetches key performance metrics from Dynatrace for applications and services. These metrics can be transformed if necessary and pushed to a data warehouse like Google BigQuery or Snowflake for long-term analysis, trend forecasting, and to inform business decisions.

- **CI/CD Deployment Quality Gates**: Integrate Dynatrace within your deployment pipeline by creating a Pipedream workflow that is triggered on a new deployment event. The workflow can call Dynatrace APIs to assess the performance impact, compare pre and post-deployment metrics and decide whether to proceed with the deployment, rollback, or trigger additional tests based on quality thresholds.
