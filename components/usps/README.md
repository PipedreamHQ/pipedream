# Overview

The USPS API provides various functionalities such as tracking shipments, calculating shipping prices, and scheduling pickups, making it a valuable tool for automating logistics and e-commerce operations. Integrating the USPS API with Pipedream allows you to create serverless workflows that can enhance how you manage shipping tasks, alert systems, or update order statuses in real-time, without needing to manage infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-time Shipment Tracking Updates**: Set up a workflow that monitors the status of shipments using the USPS API and sends real-time updates via Slack or email. When a package's status changes, Pipedream triggers an event that can be routed to notify the customer or update an internal tracking system.

- **Automated Shipping Cost Calculator**: Implement a workflow that receives order details from an e-commerce platform like Shopify, uses the USPS API to calculate shipping costs based on weight and destination, and then updates the order with the calculated shipping costs. This can streamline order processing and ensure accurate billing.

- **Scheduled Pickup Automation**: Create a workflow that automatically schedules pickups for orders ready to ship. The workflow can trigger at specified intervals, collect ready orders from a database or service like Airtable, use the USPS API to schedule the pickups, and then log the details or notify the relevant team.
