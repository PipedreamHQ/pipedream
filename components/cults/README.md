# Overview

Cults is a digital marketplace for 3D printing models. The Cults API allows you to interact with their platform programmatically. With the API, you can retrieve model data, search for designs, or get information about designers and makes. By leveraging Pipedream, you can automate workflows that react to new model uploads, filter searches, or integrate with other services like social media or notification systems. Pipedream's serverless platform provides an event-driven approach to execute code in response to Cults API events and connect to hundreds of other services with minimal setup.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Tweet of New 3D Models**: When a new model is uploaded to Cults that matches certain criteria (e.g., category, tags, or popularity), trigger a workflow that automatically posts a tweet about the model with a link to drive traffic or awareness.

- **Daily Digest of New Designs**: Compile a daily digest of new 3D designs uploaded to Cults in a specific category and send the list via email, Slack, or Discord. Use this to keep a community or customer base informed about the latest models available for 3D printing.

- **Sync New Models to a Database**: Automatically add new 3D model listings from Cults to a database or a Google Sheet for inventory tracking, price monitoring, or creating a curated repository. This can be useful for retailers or enthusiasts who want to maintain a database of models.
