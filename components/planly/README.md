# Overview

Planly is designed to streamline appointment scheduling and task management via its API, allowing users to automate their scheduling processes efficiently. Through Pipedream's integration capabilities, users can connect Planly with various other apps to automate notifications, synchronize schedules with digital calendars, manage client data, and much more. This interaction not only saves time but also enhances productivity by automating routine administrative tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Appointment Reminders via SMS**: - Build a workflow where Planly manages your appointments and, using the Twilio API on Pipedream, automatically sends SMS reminders to clients a day before their scheduled appointment. This reduces no-shows and keeps your schedule efficient.

- **Sync Appointments with Google Calendar**: - Create a workflow that automatically syncs new appointments or changes from Planly into a Google Calendar. Whenever an appointment is booked or rescheduled in Planly, it triggers a workflow in Pipedream that updates Google Calendar, keeping all involved parties up to date effortlessly.

- **Customer Feedback Collection Post-Appointment**: - Set up a workflow where, after an appointment is completed in Planly, an automated email is sent through SendGrid asking for customer feedback. This workflow helps in gathering insights about the service provided and can guide improvements.
