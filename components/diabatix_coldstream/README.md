# Overview

The Diabatix ColdStream API provides automated thermal analysis capabilities, allowing users to streamline the cooling design process for various components and devices. With this API, you can automate the design of thermal systems, optimize existing cooling solutions, and simulate different scenarios to find the most effective thermal management strategy. In Pipedream, you can leverage this API to build automated workflows that integrate thermal analysis into your engineering cycles, ensuring your designs meet the necessary thermal specifications before physical prototypes are ever built.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Thermal Analysis Reporting**: Create a workflow in Pipedream that triggers every time a new design is uploaded to your cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive). The workflow sends the design to the Diabatix ColdStream API to perform thermal analysis and then emails the report to your engineering team or saves it to a dedicated report directory.

- **Design Optimization Loop**: Set up a continuous optimization process where initial thermal design parameters are sent to the ColdStream API. The results are then evaluated, and if they don't meet specified performance criteria, the parameters are adjusted and the design is resubmitted. This loop can continue until the thermal performance is optimized, all automated within Pipedream.

- **Thermal Analysis Dashboard Integration**: Build a Pipedream workflow that integrates with a dashboard app like Geckoboard. Use Diabatix ColdStream API to run thermal analyses at regular intervals or upon specific events, and then push the summarized data to Geckoboard. This allows real-time monitoring of thermal performance metrics for ongoing projects.
