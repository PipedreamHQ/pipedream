# Overview

The PartnerStack (Partner API) API empowers you to automate and streamline your partner, affiliate, and reseller networks. Using Pipedream, you can connect this API to orchestrate workflows that synchronize partner data, track referrals and commissions, and manage payouts. This enables you to maintain a robust partner ecosystem while cutting down on manual work. By tapping into events and data from PartnerStack, you can ensure partners are rewarded promptly, gain insights into the most effective channels, and foster stronger relationships with your network.

# Example Use Cases

- **Synchronize Partner Data with CRM**: Automate the process of keeping your CRM up-to-date with the latest partner information. When a new partner joins through PartnerStack, trigger a workflow on Pipedream that creates or updates their record in your CRM platform (e.g., Salesforce or HubSpot), ensuring sales and marketing teams have the latest data at their fingertips.

- **Referral Reward Notifications**: Create an instant notification system for rewarding successful referrals. When a partner generates a new sale via PartnerStack, use Pipedream to send a notification through Slack or email to your team. This workflow could also update a dashboard (e.g., Google Sheets or Geckoboard) that tracks referral success in real-time, keeping everyone informed and motivated.

- **Automated Commission Payouts**: Streamline your commission payment process. When PartnerStack records a commission for a partner, trigger a workflow on Pipedream to process the payment through your accounting software (e.g., QuickBooks or Xero). This eliminates the need for manual entry, reduces errors, and ensures that partners receive their payments swiftly and accurately.
