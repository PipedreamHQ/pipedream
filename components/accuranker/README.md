# Overview

Accuranker is an SEO tool that specializes in tracking and reporting on keyword rankings. Using the Accuranker API with Pipedream, you can automate checks on keyword positions, get insights on SERP data, and respond to ranking changes in real time. You can also compile performance reports, set up alerts for ranking changes, and integrate with other platforms to link SEO data with marketing, sales, or content strategies.

# Example Use Cases

- **Daily Keyword Performance Digest**: Compile a daily report of keyword rankings and performance changes. Using Pipedream's Scheduled Triggers, the workflow can fetch data from Accuranker each day and send a summarized report via email using the SendGrid app or post it to a Slack channel where the SEO team can quickly review it.

- **Alert System for Ranking Drops**: Set up an alert system that monitors significant ranking drops and notifies the team. If a tracked keyword falls below a certain threshold, Pipedream can trigger a notification to a designated Slack channel or send an SMS via Twilio. This allows for immediate action to investigate and address potential SEO issues.

- **Competitor Ranking Analysis**: Track and compare your keyword rankings against your main competitors'. The workflow can retrieve competitor ranking data from Accuranker, process it within Pipedream, and then send the analysis to Google Sheets for further review and long-term tracking. This can be invaluable for strategic planning and for identifying content or keyword opportunities.
