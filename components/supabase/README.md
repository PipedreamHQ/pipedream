# Overview

Supabase is an open-source database, authentication system, and hosting
platform that allows you to quickly and easily build powerful web-based
applications. Supabase’s API provides developers with the ability to quickly
create, manage, and control data on their projects.

When combined with other libraries, such as React or Redux, developers can
create fast, secure, and reliable websites. With Supabase’s API, developers can
connect, query, and manage data on their web projects via a simple and
intuitive interface.

Here is a list of some of the things you can build using the Supabase API:

- Professional websites with custom content management
- Node.js applications that read and write data to the database
- GraphQL APIs for connecting front-end applications to the backend
- Cloud-based Single-page applications
- Web-based applications with authentication and security features
- Mobile apps with real-time synchronization to the cloud database
- IoT applications with remote control capabilities
- Machine learning applications that use predictive analytics

## Webhooks

Supabase provides support for Database Webhooks, and you can easily configure them through the Supabase website by following these simple steps:

1. Begin by configuring and deploying the [instant] trigger in Pipedream.
2. Take note of the generated URL endpoint.
3. Refer to [this tutorial](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/webhooks#creating-a-webhook) and follow the outlined instructions.
4. Make sure to select `HTTP Request` as the webhook type.
5. In the `HTTP Request` section, select the `POST` method and paste the URL generated by the Pipedream source.

That's it! You will now receive notifications in your trigger whenever an event occurs.
