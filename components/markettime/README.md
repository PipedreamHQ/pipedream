With MarketTime, you can build custom clock and timer applications for your
website or blog. For example, you can display a clock that shows the current
time in your local time zone, or a timer that counts down to a specific event.

Here are some examples of what you can build with MarketTime:

- A clock that shows the current time in your local time zone
- A timer that counts down to a specific event
- A clock that shows the current time in multiple time zones
