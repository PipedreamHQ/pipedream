# Overview

PagerDuty's APIs allow you to integrate the powerful incident response
capabilities of PagerDuty with your own custom applications. With PagerDuty's
APIs, you can build applications to optimize your incident response process,
collaborate with teams more effectively, and analyze data from your incident
