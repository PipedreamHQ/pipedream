# Overview

The Vestaboard API allows you to control a networked, mechanical split-flap display, enabling you to automate the content it shows. By integrating with Pipedream, you can develop serverless workflows that respond to various triggers (like incoming webhooks, emails, or scheduled timers) and push updates to your Vestaboard. You can dynamically display information such as meeting reminders, real-time performance metrics, or custom messages based on events from other apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Dynamic Performance Dashboard**: Use the Vestaboard API on Pipedream to create a live dashboard that displays key business metrics. Connect to apps like Google Sheets or Salesforce, fetch the latest data, and send it to your Vestaboard to keep your team informed and motivated.

- **Meeting Room Schedule Display**: Create a workflow that integrates with calendar services like Google Calendar or Office 365. Extract upcoming events and format the data to display meeting schedules on your Vestaboard in real-time, ensuring everyone knows when and where their next meeting is.

- **Slack-Powered Announcements**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for specific commands or messages in Slack. When a trigger phrase is detected, capture the message content and automatically update your Vestaboard with the latest announcements or alerts for your team to see.
