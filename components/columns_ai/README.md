# Overview

The Columns Ai API allows users to interact and manage their data in a spreadsheet-like interface but with the capabilities of a database. It supports actions like reading, writing, updating, and deleting data entries programmatically. This API is particularly useful for applications like dynamic data manipulation, automated reporting, and integrating spreadsheet data with other services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Entry from Web Forms to Columns Ai**: Capture data from web forms using services like Typeform or Google Forms, and automatically populate it in a Columns Ai spreadsheet. This is ideal for lead capture forms or feedback collection, where the data is immediately organized and available for analysis in Columns Ai.

- **Dynamic Inventory Management**: Connect Columns Ai with an eCommerce platform like Shopify. Automatically update inventory counts in Columns Ai based on sales data from Shopify. Use this workflow to keep real-time tabs on stock levels, triggering alerts or actions when supplies need to be reordered.

- **Scheduled Reporting**: Combine Columns Ai with Cron Scheduler on Pipedream to generate and send daily, weekly, or monthly reports. Extract data from Columns Ai, format it into a comprehensive report, and distribute it via email (using an email service like SendGrid) or Slack to keep teams informed about key metrics and trends.
