# Overview

Columns Ai API empowers developers to extract structured data from unstructured text using machine learning. It can parse information like dates, locations, names, or any specific data from free text, which can be highly useful in automating data entry, enhancing content analysis, and streamlining data processing tasks.

# Example Use Cases

Use Columns Ai in a workflow that inputs resume data and outputs structured JSON to be stored in a database or used to populate fields in an HR management system.
