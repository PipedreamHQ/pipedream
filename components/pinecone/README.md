# Overview

The Pinecone API enables you to work with vector databases, which are essential for building and scaling applications with AI features like recommendation systems, image recognition, and natural language processing. On Pipedream, you can create serverless workflows integrating Pinecone with other apps, automate data ingestion, query vector databases in response to events, and orchestrate complex data processing pipelines that leverage Pinecone's similarity search.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Ticket Routing**: Automate the categorization and routing of customer support tickets by integrating Pinecone with a customer support platform like Zendesk. Use machine learning models to encode ticket text into vectors and query Pinecone to find similar past tickets for quick resolution.

- **Real-time Product Recommendations**: Build a workflow that triggers when users view products on an e-commerce platform like Shopify. Capture viewing events, process product descriptions through ML models to obtain vectors, and query Pinecone to generate real-time personalized product recommendations for users.

- **Content Discovery and Matching**: Connect Pinecone with a content management system like WordPress. When new content is published, convert it to a vector representation and upload it to Pinecone. Set up a workflow that responds to user queries by searching Pinecone for the most relevant content vectors, enhancing content discoverability.
