It can also send reminders to both the interviewers and the candidate a day before the scheduled interview.

- **New Hire Onboarding**: Kick off onboarding workflows once a candidate accepts an offer. This could involve creating user accounts in apps like Slack or Office 365, sending out welcome emails with necessary documentation, and adding new hires to relevant mailing lists and project management tools such as Trello or Asana.
