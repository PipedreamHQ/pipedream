# Overview

The Generated Photos API lets developers generate realistic photos of people
and products. This can be useful for creating stock photos, or for building
applications that require lifelike images of people or products.

Here are some examples of what you can build with the Generated Photos API:

- A stock photo library
- A photorealistic product rendering tool
- A social media application that requires lifelike images of people
