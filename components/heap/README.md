# Overview

The Heap API enables you to automate and integrate your user analytics data with other applications. With Heap, you can extract insights on how users interact with your product, track events without code, and funnel this data into your CRM, marketing tools, or custom dashboards. It's about connecting the dots between user actions and your strategic moves. Heap's API lets you push or pull data, so you're always up-to-date on user behavior and can personalize user experiences at scale.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync User Data to CRM**: Automatically push user engagement metrics from Heap to your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. Keep sales informed with the latest user activity for better lead scoring and personalized follow-ups.

- **Trigger Email Campaigns Based on User Behavior**: When Heap identifies a significant user action, like reaching a milestone in your app, use that signal to trigger an automated email campaign in a tool like SendGrid. Capitalize on user engagement at its peak to increase conversion rates.

- **Create Custom Dashboards with Google Sheets**: Pull data from Heap into Google Sheets to build custom dashboards. Use this live data to make informed decisions and share analytics with stakeholders who may not have direct access to Heap or prefer data in a spreadsheet format.
