# Overview

Re:amaze is a customer service and engagement platform that combines email, social media, mobile, and live chat communication with customers into a single, integrated dashboard. Leveraging the Re:amaze API on Pipedream allows automating routine support tasks, syncing customer data across platforms, triggering event-based communications, and more. This API's functionality can streamline customer interactions, ensure timely responses, and enhance overall customer experience management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Auto-responder for Off-Hours**: Use the Re:amaze API to detect when a new support message is received outside business hours. Automatically send a customized message to let the customer know their query has been received and will be addressed first thing in the morning.

- **Synchronize Support Tickets with a CRM**: Whenever a new ticket is created in Re:amaze, trigger a workflow that creates or updates the customer's record in a CRM like Salesforce. This ensures that the sales and support teams have up-to-date customer interactions data.

- **Automated Feedback Collection Post-Resolution**: After a ticket is marked as resolved in Re:amaze, trigger an automated email or survey request for feedback on the support experience. Integrate with a platform like Typeform for collecting responses and analyze customer satisfaction over time.
