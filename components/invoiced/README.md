# Overview

The Invoiced API empowers users to automate billing and invoicing processes with ease. It facilitates the creation, sending, and management of invoices, along with tracking payments and customer interaction. By harnessing the Invoiced API on Pipedream, you can craft workflows that respond to business events in real-time, sync invoice data with accounting software, or trigger customer engagement actions upon payment statuses.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Generation and Delivery**: When a new sale is recorded in a CRM like Salesforce, Pipedream can trigger the Invoiced API to create and send a corresponding invoice to the customer, ensuring billing is prompt and tied directly to sales activity.

- **Payment Status Monitoring and Alerts**: Use Pipedream to set up a workflow where payment status updates from Invoiced trigger notifications. For example, when an invoice is paid, you could send a Slack message to your finance team and update the customerâ€™s record in a database like Airtable.

- **Subscription Management on Payment Failure**: If Invoiced indicates a subscription payment has failed, Pipedream can automatically pause the user's access to the service and alert customer support to reach out via an email platform such as SendGrid.
