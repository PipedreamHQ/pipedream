# Overview

The Dropbox Sign (formerly HelloSign) API enables seamless integration of electronic signature workflows into any application or service. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to automate signature requests, track document status, and streamline document management processes. By combining Dropbox Sign with Pipedream's capabilities, you can create powerful automations that save time, reduce errors, and maintain a high level of professional engagement in document signing experiences.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Workflow for HR**: Start an automated workflow when a new employee is added to an HR management system like BambooHR. Use Dropbox Sign to send employment contracts for signature and automatically store signed documents back in the HR system.

- **Dynamic Document Generation and Signing**: Generate personalized documents using customer data from a CRM like Salesforce. Then, dispatch them for signing via Dropbox Sign and monitor the signing progress. Completed documents could then trigger downstream actions like updating CRM records or initiating onboarding workflows.

- **Invoice Approval and Archiving**: When a new invoice is created in an accounting app like QuickBooks, trigger a Pipedream workflow to request signatures via Dropbox Sign. Once signed, save the invoice to cloud storage like Google Drive and update the invoice status in QuickBooks.
