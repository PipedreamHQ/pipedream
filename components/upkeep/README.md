# Overview

The [UpKeep API](https://www.upkeep.com/) allows developers to build
Maintenance & Operations solutions for their customers and end users. The API
enables developers to access data on their users' assets, tasks, and
maintenance operations. With the UpKeep API, developers can build custom
solutions for asset management, equipment tracking, work order management, and
more.

Some of the features that the UpKeep API provides include:

- Asset Tracking: Track your assets with detailed information, such as location
  and usage stats.
- Task Management: Keep track of tasks assigned to your users or users assigned
  to tasks.
- Maintenance Operations: Record and track maintenance operations, such as
  repairs and replacements.
- Work Order Management: Create and manage work orders, including assigning
  technicians and tracking progress.

Here are some examples of what you can build using the UpKeep API:

- Maintenance & Operations Solutions: Create solutions that manage equipment,
  plan and schedule maintenance, record maintenance operations, and track asset
  usage.
- Fleet Management Solutions: Create solutions that track fleet assets,
  including vehicles and equipment, and monitor usage.
- Task Management Solutions: Create solutions that allow users to assign and
  manage tasks, as well as track their progress.
