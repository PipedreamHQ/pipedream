# Overview

The UpKeep API enables users to seamlessly integrate maintenance management tasks with Pipedream's serverless execution platform. By leveraging UpKeep's endpoints, you can automate workflows related to asset tracking, work order management, and preventive maintenance scheduling. The API's capabilities allow for real-time updates on equipment status, automated notifications for maintenance tasks, and data synchronization across maintenance teams and tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Work Order Creation**: Trigger a new work order in UpKeep when a customer support ticket in Zendesk indicates equipment failure. This workflow can include pulling relevant customer data from the ticket, inputting it into the work order, and notifying the maintenance team in Slack.

- **Preventive Maintenance Scheduling**: Use a cron job to schedule preventive maintenance tasks. The workflow can fetch equipment usage logs from an IoT platform, like Particle, evaluate if service is due, and create a maintenance request in UpKeep if thresholds are met.

- **Inventory Management Alerts**: Connect UpKeep with an inventory management app like TradeGecko to monitor stock levels. When inventory falls below a certain threshold, the workflow can automatically generate a purchase order in UpKeep and notify the procurement team via email or a messaging app like Microsoft Teams.
