# Overview

The Airmeet API enables you to automate and manage virtual events with ease. By integrating with Pipedream, you can create custom workflows that interact with the Airmeet platform, such as attendee management, event scheduling, and real-time updates. Utilize the API to sync event data, send notifications, and connect with other services for a comprehensive event automation solution.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Attendees with CRM**: Automatically add new Airmeet event attendees to your CRM system. When a new attendee joins an Airmeet event, Pipedream can capture this event and create or update a contact in platforms like Salesforce or HubSpot, ensuring your sales and marketing teams have the latest information.

- **Automate Event Follow-ups**: Send personalized follow-up emails or messages to participants after an event. Use Pipedream to listen for the conclusion of an Airmeet event, then trigger an email through SendGrid or a message through Slack or Twilio, thanking attendees and providing additional resources or call-to-actions.

- **Real-time Analytics Dashboard**: Stream live event data to a dashboard for real-time insights. With Airmeet's API, Pipedream can push attendance numbers, interaction levels, and other key metrics to a Google Sheets or a visualization tool like Grafana, helping you gauge event success instantly.
