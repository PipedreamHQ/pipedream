# Overview

FullContact's API enriches contact information, letting you turn partial identities like an email address into a full profile including social presence, demographic data, and more. This is invaluable for enhancing customer understanding and personalizing interactions. By leveraging Pipedream's powerful integrations, you can automate workflows that consume FullContact's enriched data, facilitating tasks like lead enrichment, audience segmentation, and personalized marketing at scale.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Enrichment on CRM Update**: Trigger a workflow when a new lead is added to a CRM like HubSpot. Use FullContact to enrich the lead's information and update their CRM profile with additional details such as social media handles or job titles. This enriched data can then drive more tailored sales strategies.

- **Personalized Email Campaigns**: On receiving a new subscriber in an email marketing tool like Mailchimp, pass the email to FullContact for enrichment. Use the returned data to segment the subscribers based on demographics or interests and tailor email campaigns, thus boosting engagement and conversions.

- **Customer Support Enhancement**: When a support ticket is created in a platform like Zendesk, use FullContact to enrich the customer's profile information. Provide this additional context to support agents, enabling them to offer a more personalized and informed customer service experience.
