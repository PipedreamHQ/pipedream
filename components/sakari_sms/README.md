# Overview

The Sakari SMS API allows you to send and receive text messages programmatically, giving you the power to create custom messaging experiences within your apps. On Pipedream, you can harness this capability to build serverless workflows that integrate SMS with various services and automate communication processes. Whether it's sending notifications, processing inbound messages, or coordinating with other APIs, the possibilities are broad.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support Notifications**: Trigger an SMS to a customer when a support ticket is updated in your helpdesk platform (like Zendesk or Freshdesk). The workflow can listen for ticket updates and use Sakari SMS to send a text to the customer with the status of their request.

- **Order Confirmation Texts**: Connect Sakari SMS with an e-commerce platform (like Shopify or WooCommerce). Send an order confirmation and shipping updates via SMS whenever a new order is placed or a shipping status is updated, keeping customers informed in real-time.

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) System**: Implement an extra layer of security for your app by using Sakari SMS to send 2FA codes. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers an SMS with a one-time passcode when a user attempts to log in or perform a sensitive action within your system.
