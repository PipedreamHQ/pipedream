# Overview

The Google People API lets you manage contact information for people in your
Google account. You can use this API to create and manage contacts, as well as
groups of contacts. With the People API, you can list all the contacts in your
account, as well as their information, such as email addresses, phone numbers,
and contact photos. You can also use the People API to create new contacts, or
to add new information to existing contacts.

Pipedream's use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to any other app will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the Limited Use requirements.
