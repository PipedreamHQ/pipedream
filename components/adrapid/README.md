# Overview

The Adrapid API allows developers to automate and integrate their digital advertising processes. Through this API, you can create, manage, and optimize ad campaigns programmatically. This includes tasks like uploading creatives, setting targeting parameters, and retrieving campaign performance data. With Pipedream, you can connect the Adrapid API to other apps and services to streamline advertising workflows, enhance reporting, and react in real-time to marketing analytics.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Ad Campaign Creation**: Automatically create ad campaigns in Adrapid when a new product is added to your eCommerce platform like Shopify. This can include setting up the campaign parameters, uploading images, and configuring targeting based on product categories.

- **Dynamic Ad Adjustments Based on Performance**: Monitor your ad campaign performance on Adrapid and use thresholds to trigger adjustments. For example, if the click-through rate (CTR) falls below a certain percentage, automatically adjust the bid amount or pause underperforming ads to optimize the campaign budget.

- **Real-Time Reporting and Alerts**: Set up workflows to pull performance data from Adrapid at regular intervals. Combine this data with other metrics from platforms like Google Analytics to create a comprehensive dashboard in tools like Google Sheets or Tableau. Additionally, configure alerts to notify team members via email or Slack when specific milestones are reached or anomalies are detected.
