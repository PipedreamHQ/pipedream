# Overview

The Vosfactures API offers robust features for managing invoices, quotes, and orders within your business. With Pipedream, you can automate workflows that leverage these capabilities, streamlining your accounting processes and integrating them with other apps. From auto-generating invoices based on specific triggers to syncing your financials with accounting software or CRM systems, the opportunities for automation are vast.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Generation from E-commerce Sales**: When a new sale is processed on an e-commerce platform like Shopify, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that creates an invoice in Vosfactures. This ensures that every sale is instantly reflected in your accounting.

- **Scheduled Financial Reporting**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to retrieve financial data from Vosfactures at regular intervals. This data can be compiled into reports and sent to stakeholders via email, Slack, or other communication platforms, keeping everyone informed without manual effort.

- **CRM Integration for Client Onboarding**: On the creation of a new contact in a CRM like HubSpot, a Pipedream workflow can automatically create a client profile within Vosfactures. This keeps client data in sync and streamlines the onboarding process for new business.
