# Overview

The Humanitix API provides a programmable interface to interact with the Humanitix event platform, enabling you to automate and integrate event management processes with other systems. With this API, you can retrieve event details, manage attendees, and handle bookings programmatically. When used on Pipedream, you can leverage serverless workflows to connect Humanitix with a myriad of other apps and services, streamlining tasks like attendee communication, marketing efforts, and data analysis.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Attendee Engagement**: After an attendee registers for an event on Humanitix, use Pipedream to trigger a workflow that sends a personalized welcome email via SendGrid, adds the attendee to a Mailchimp list for future updates, and posts their name and company to a Slack channel to acknowledge their registration internally.

- **Real-Time Event Performance Dashboard**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to pull event data from Humanitix regularly. Push this data to Google Sheets or a database like PostgreSQL. Use this data source to create a live dashboard with a tool like Google Data Studio, providing real-time insights into ticket sales and attendance figures.

- **Post-Event Feedback Collection**: After an event concludes, trigger a workflow on Pipedream to send out a Typeform survey to all attendees for feedback. Collect responses and store them in a cloud storage service like AWS S3 or Google Drive, and then automatically summarize the feedback in a report using natural language processing (NLP) services and email it to the event organizers.
