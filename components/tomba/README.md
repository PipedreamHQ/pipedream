# Overview

The Tomba API provides tools for email lookup and domain search, enabling users to find and verify email addresses associated with a domain. This capability is particularly valuable for marketing professionals, recruiters, and sales teams who need to gather contact information for outreach and lead generation. By leveraging the Tomba API on Pipedream, you can automate the process of collecting email addresses, integrate with CRM systems to enrich contact data, or setup alerts for new email discoveries.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Generation Automation**: Automate lead collection by setting up a workflow that triggers every time a new domain is added to your CRM system. The workflow uses the Tomba API to extract emails from the domain and automatically populates these contacts into your CRM. This can be particularly useful for sales teams needing fresh leads without manual research.

- **Email Verification System**: Implement a workflow that verifies the validity of email addresses as they are entered into your business applications. This can reduce bounce rates by ensuring emails in your marketing campaigns are accurate. The Tomba API can be paired with your email marketing platform via Pipedream, providing real-time verification.

- **Competitive Monitoring**: Track competitor domains automatically by setting up a Pipedream workflow that checks for new emails registered under competitor domains using the Tomba API. This info could be pushed to a Slack channel or saved in a Google Sheet for strategic planning and monitoring.
