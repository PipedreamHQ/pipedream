# Overview

The Common Paper API lets you automate contract management functions, such as creating, sending, and managing contracts programmatically. Integrating Common Paper API with Pipedream allows you to trigger workflows from contract events, sync contract data with other platforms, or dynamically generate contracts based on actions in other apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Auto-Generate Contracts from CRM Deals**: When a deal reaches a certain stage in a CRM like Salesforce, trigger a Pipedream workflow to create a contract in Common Paper with the deal details. Then, send the contract to the customer for signature.

- **Sync Contract Status with Project Management Tools**: Keep your project management tool, like Asana, up-to-date by using Pipedream to monitor contract status changes in Common Paper. When a contract is signed or updated, automatically update the corresponding project or task in Asana.

- **Automate Contract Approvals via Slack**: Streamline the approval process by sending contract drafts from Common Paper to a designated Slack channel for review. Pipedream can listen for approvals directly in Slack, then update the contract status or push it to the next stage in the workflow.
