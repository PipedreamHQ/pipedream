# Overview

The UK gov Vehicle Enquiry API provides a range of data relating to vehicles
registered in the UK such as MOT, tax and driver & vehicle licence information.
With this API, developers can create tools and applications that allow the user
to search, store and retrieve vehicle-related data.

Using this comprehensive API, developers can build all sorts of powerful
applications and services which can be used to simplify the process of
determining the ownership of a vehicle, identify vehicle tax and MOT history,
check vehicle compatibility for renting or leasing, and validate customer
payment details, to name a few.

Here are some of the many things developers can build with the UK gov Vehicle
Enquiry API:

- Automated MOT and Tax Reminder Services
- Vehicle Tracking Systems
- Vehicle Rental and Leasing Platforms
- Vehicle Theft Detection Systems
- Vehicle Sale and Valuation Services
- Residual Value Calculators
- License Plate Recognition Systems
