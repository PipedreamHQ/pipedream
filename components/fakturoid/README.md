# Overview

The Fakturoid API allows for automation of invoicing and accounting tasks directly within the Fakturoid online system. With this API, developers can manipulate invoices, clients, expenses, and much more, streamlining financial workflows and integrating them with various other tools and services. Using Pipedream, you can connect Fakturoid with numerous apps to automate routine bookkeeping tasks, send notifications, synchronize data across platforms, and trigger actions based on invoice events.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Generation and Email Notification**: Create workflows on Pipedream that listen for specific triggers (like a new transaction in an e-commerce platform) to automatically generate invoices in Fakturoid. Once the invoice is created, use Pipedream to send an email notification to the customer with the invoice details attached, using an email service like SendGrid.

- **Monthly Financial Reports Automation**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to automatically generate and fetch monthly financial reports from Fakturoid. Connect it to Google Sheets to save and analyze the data, allowing for easy access and insightful financial overview without manual effort.

- **Real-Time Inventory Updates on New Invoices**: Whenever a new invoice is generated in Fakturoid, use a Pipedream workflow to update inventory numbers in a Shopify store. This ensures that inventory levels are adjusted in real time, reducing the risk of overselling and helping maintain accurate stock counts.
