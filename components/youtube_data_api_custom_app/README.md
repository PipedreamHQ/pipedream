# Overview

 What can I build using YouTube's Data API?

The YouTube Data API (also known as the YouTube Custom App API) is a powerful tool that enables developers to build applications that interact with YouTube's platform. With it, developers can create apps that display data about the videos and channels on YouTube, fetch metadata about specific videos, modify existing videos, and much more.

Some of the many possibilities enabled by the YouTube Data API include:

- Building applications that search for relevant videos and channels within YouTube
- Displaying detailed information about specific videos and channels
- Modifying existing videos
- Uploading videos to YouTube
- Constructing an application that categorizes videos and channels by topics
- Constructing an application that shows video comments
- Creating an object detection detection application that can detect objects present in a video
- Fetching metadata about videos and channels
