# Overview

The YouTube (Data API) - Custom App API on Pipedream lets you wield the vast capabilities of YouTube's platform directly within your automated workflows. Leverage this API to manage channels, playlists, subscriptions, and videos. You can automate video uploads, sync channel data with other platforms, analyze metrics, and engage with your audience without manual intervention. Utilize the power of serverless and event-driven architecture to respond to video events in real-time, enrich your marketing strategies, and maintain an active, data-informed YouTube presence.

# Example Use Cases

- **Video Upload Automation**: Automate the process of video uploads. Once a new video file is dropped into a designated cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox, Pipedream can detect the new file, trigger a workflow, and use the YouTube Data API to upload the video to your channel, setting titles, descriptions, and tags based on predefined templates or metadata from the file.

- **YouTube Channel Analytics Dashboard**: Create a custom analytics dashboard by pulling data from YouTube's API to track views, likes, comments, and subscriber counts. With Pipedream, you can schedule this as a periodic workflow that extracts the latest metrics from your YouTube channel and pushes them to a Google Sheet or a dashboard app like Geckoboard, keeping you constantly informed with up-to-date channel performance insights.

- **Automated Comment Moderation**: Set up a workflow that monitors new comments on your YouTube videos for specific keywords or phrases that may indicate spam or inappropriate content. Use the YouTube Data API with Pipedream to automatically flag, hide, or delete these comments, and if necessary, notify you via email or messaging apps like Slack for manual review, ensuring your community remains positive and engaging.
