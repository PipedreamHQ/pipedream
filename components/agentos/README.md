# Overview

The agentOS API enables real estate professionals to streamline operations through automation of property management, client communication, and financial tasks. This API integrates various aspects of property management systems, allowing users to automate updates, retrieve data, and sync information across platforms. By using Pipedream to connect agentOS with other apps, users can create powerful workflows that automate day-to-day operations, enhance customer interactions, and optimize administrative processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Tenant Screening and Communication**: Set up a workflow where new rental applications from your website trigger an automated tenant screening process using the agentOS API. Successful applicants can automatically be sent a congratulatory email and lease agreement through Gmail or another email service.

- **Sync Financial Data for Real-Time Reporting**: Create a workflow that synchronizes financial transactions recorded in agentOS with your accounting software, like QuickBooks. This can ensure real-time financial reporting and reduce manual data entry errors, keeping your books up-to-date and accurate.

- **Maintenance Request Automation**: Implement a system where maintenance requests submitted through a tenant portal are automatically logged in agentOS and assigned to the appropriate service provider. Notifications can be sent to both the tenant and service provider via SMS or email, ensuring quick response times and efficient handling of requests.
