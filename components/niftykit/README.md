# Overview

The NiftyKit API offers a platform to create, sell, and manage digital collectibles on the blockchain. Users can mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs), set up drop campaigns, and handle various aspects of the NFT lifecycle. Integrating NiftyKit with Pipedream enables users to automate workflows related to NFTs, like minting in response to events, updating listings based on market conditions, or synchronizing NFT ownership data with other databases.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated NFT Minting on Sale**: When a sale is confirmed via a payment gateway like Stripe, Pipedream can listen for this event and trigger an automated NFT minting process through NiftyKit, assigning the digital collectible to the buyer's wallet address.

- **Dynamic Pricing Based on Market Conditions**: Connect to a cryptocurrency price feed API to monitor fluctuations in the market. Use Pipedream to adjust the price of NFTs on NiftyKit in real-time, ensuring your pricing strategies remain competitive and responsive.

- **NFT Ownership Verification for Exclusive Content**: Leverage NiftyKit's API in Pipedream to verify NFT ownership before granting access to exclusive content. When a user requests access, Pipedream can check their wallet against the ledger on NiftyKit to confirm they own a specific NFT before unlocking content.
