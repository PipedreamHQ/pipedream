# Overview

The Smiirl API lets you interface with Smiirl counters to dynamically update and manage the display of real-time data. Leveraging Pipedream's robust integration platform, you can connect Smiirl to various data sources, triggering updates that reflect key metrics like social media followers, sales figures, or any other number that's essential to your business or personal goals.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automatically Update Counter with E-Commerce Sales**: Set up an automation that listens for new orders on your e-commerce platform (like Shopify). Whenever a new sale is processed, a Pipedream workflow triggers an update to your Smiirl counter, instantly reflecting the updated sales numbers in your physical store or office.

- **Display Real-Time Subscriber Growth**: Hook up Smiirl to your YouTube or Twitch account using Pipedream. Each time your subscriber count increases, the Smiirl counter is updated, offering a live view of your channel's growing popularity to visitors or employees.

- **Showcase Environmental Metrics**: If you're monitoring environmental data, such as energy consumption or carbon footprint, link your monitoring tools to Smiirl via Pipedream. As the data updates, so does your Smiirl counter, making your commitment to sustainability visible and keeping the team informed and motivated.
