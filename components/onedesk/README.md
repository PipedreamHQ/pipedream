# Overview

The [OneDesk API](https://www.onedesk.com/) allows developers to easily access
and integrate several of OneDesk's core services into their own applications.
With the OneDesk API, developers are able to customize and combine multiple
services to create completely unique and versatile applications that their
users can enjoy.

The OneDesk API provides developers access to:

- Project Management: Create, edit and delete projects and tasks, and
  collaborate with team members

Using these and other core services from OneDesk, developers can create

  allows teams to collaborate on planning and organizing projects
