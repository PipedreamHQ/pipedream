# Overview

The Microsoft OneDrive API taps into the robust file storage and management capabilities of OneDrive, allowing for operations like file uploads, retrievals, sharing, and synchronization. Integrating this API into Pipedream workflows lets you automate tasks involving file management, content collaboration, and data backup processes. With OneDrive's API on Pipedream, you can streamline document workflows, trigger actions based on file changes, and connect your file storage to countless other services for enhanced productivity.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Backup of New Database Entries**: When new data is added to a database (such as Airtable or Google Sheets), trigger a Pipedream workflow that converts this data into a CSV file and automatically uploads it to a specified folder in OneDrive for safekeeping and archiving.

- **Document Distribution on File Upload**: Upon uploading a new document to a OneDrive folder, use a Pipedream workflow to automatically distribute the file via email (using SendGrid or Gmail) to a predefined list of recipients, ensuring team members receive the latest versions of important documents instantly.

- **Social Media Photo Sync**: Sync new photos from a social media platform (like Instagram or Twitter) to a OneDrive album using Pipedream. Whenever a new photo is posted to your social media account, the workflow grabs the image and saves it to OneDrive, creating a backup and making it easy to access and share your social media content.
