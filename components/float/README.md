# Overview

The Float API allows you to interact with Float's resource scheduling platform programmatically. With it, you can manage projects, tasks, people, and time off, as well as retrieve reports on workload and capacity. On Pipedream, the API can be leveraged to create automated workflows that link Float's scheduling capabilities with other apps, streamlining project management processes, syncing with calendars, and dynamically updating team schedules.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Project Assignment Notifications**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a new project is assigned in Float. Send an email or Slack message to the designated team member with project details, deadlines, and any special instructions.

- **Sync Float Schedule with Google Calendar**: Use Pipedream to watch for changes in tasks or project assignments in Float, then automatically create or update corresponding events in a Google Calendar, keeping everyone's schedule in sync.

- **Track Time Off Requests**: When a time off request is submitted in Float, initiate a Pipedream workflow that logs the request in an HR management system like BambooHR, updates the team's availability in Float, and sends a notification to the team lead for approval.
