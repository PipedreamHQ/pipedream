# Overview

The ManyChat API lets you manage and automate conversations in your chatbot, giving you control over user data, tags, and messaging. Integrating ManyChat with Pipedream can supercharge your chatbot workflows, enabling you to connect your ManyChat bot to various apps and services, automate interactions based on triggers, and analyze chatbot data to improve user engagement.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync ManyChat Contacts to CRM**: Automatically add new ManyChat subscribers as contacts in your CRM, like Salesforce or HubSpot. This keeps your sales team in the loop with the latest leads generated from your chatbot conversations.

- **Broadcast Messages Based on User Actions**: Deploy a workflow that sends a broadcast message to a segment of ManyChat users when they perform a specific action, such as visiting a particular page on your website. This can be done by integrating ManyChat with an analytics tool like Google Analytics to track page visits, triggering a ManyChat broadcast via Pipedream.

- **Customer Support Ticket Creation**: Create a support ticket in tools like Zendesk or Help Scout whenever a user reports an issue through ManyChat. This workflow can be enhanced with sentiment analysis using a service like MonkeyLearn to prioritize urgent tickets.
