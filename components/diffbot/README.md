# Overview

The Diffbot API enables you to extract structured data from web pages automatically. It transforms the chaos of the web into usable information through web scraping and natural language processing. On Pipedream, you can use Diffbot to monitor changes on websites, extract article data, or process web pages for specific information. By tapping into Pipedreamâ€™s ability to integrate with hundreds of other services, you can create powerful workflows that automate data extraction and act on the data in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Change Detection**  
  Use Diffbot to monitor a product page for changes and trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever the price or availability changes. This can be connected to a notification service like Slack or email to alert your team immediately.

- **Article Extraction and Analysis**  
  Extract articles from a set of URLs using Diffbot and send the extracted text to a sentiment analysis API like IBM Watson. Store the sentiment scores in a Google Sheet for easy tracking and visualization of the sentiment of news articles or blog posts over time.

- **Lead Generation Automation**  
  Scrape contact information from a list of company websites using Diffbot. Combine this with the Clearbit API to enrich the data and add it to a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot, automating the lead generation process.
