# Overview

The Tapform API furnishes a way to automate and integrate form data handling in Pipedream's serverless environment. With it, you can manipulate form submissions, manage user data, and connect forms to other services for complex workflows. This opens endless possibilities to streamline data collection processes, react in real-time to user submissions, and connect form data to more than 3,000+ apps available on Pipedream.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Lead Capture and CRM Integration**: When a new form submission comes in via Tapform, automate the capture of leads by sending the data directly into a CRM like HubSpot. This not only saves time but ensures that every potential customer is immediately accounted for and can be followed up with promptly.

- **Real-Time Notification System**: Set up a workflow that triggers a notification through email or messaging platforms like Slack whenever a Tapform submission is received. This could be crucial for time-sensitive applications, such as customer support queries or order forms, allowing teams to react swiftly to customer needs.

- **Data Aggregation and Analysis**: Collect submission data from Tapform and send it to a Google Sheets document for further analysis. This can help in compiling data over time, making it easier to spot trends, understand user behavior, and make informed decisions based on the aggregated form data.
