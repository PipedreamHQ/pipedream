# Overview

The SMS Everyone API lets you send SMS messages to users in Australia, offering a platform for automated text message communication. In Pipedream, you can harness this API to create workflows that trigger SMS notifications based on various events. Combine it with other apps and services to tailor unique automation solutions, such as sending alerts, reminders, or marketing messages directly from your Pipedream workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Order Updates**: Automate order confirmation and dispatch notifications by linking the SMS Everyone API with an e-commerce platform like Shopify. When a new order is placed or shipped, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends an SMS to the customer with their order details and tracking information.

- **Appointment Reminders**: Pair the SMS Everyone API with Google Calendar. Set up a Pipedream workflow that checks your calendar for upcoming appointments and automatically sends an SMS reminder to the participants a day before the meeting.

- **Server Downtime Alerts**: Integrate the SMS Everyone API with monitoring tools like Datadog or New Relic. Create a workflow in Pipedream that listens for server downtime or performance issues and sends an SMS alert to the IT support team for immediate action.
