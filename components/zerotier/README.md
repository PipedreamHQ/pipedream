# Overview

With the ZeroTier API, you can create powerful zero-trust networks across
applications, subsystems, devices, and end-users. The API lets you control and
monitor all of the different components that make up a ZeroTier network,
empowering you to build powerful networking solutions. Below are some examples
of what you can build using the ZeroTier API:

- Secure communication infrastructure, connecting nodes, services, and users
  inside and outside of corporate networks
- Secure sites and services, linked securely for public or private access
- Fault-tolerant load-balancing and service-mesh capabilities for microservices
  applications
- Securely manage deployments, allowing for remote access and control from
  anywhere
- Network-based authentication, providing additional layers of security to
  different types of systems
- Data streaming networks, connecting edge-devices to central systems in
  real-time
- Scalable peer-to-peer networks, simplifying distributed computing
  applications
