# Overview

The Docsumo API offers robust capabilities for extracting and processing data from various types of documents, like invoices, receipts, and bank statements. It applies intelligent OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to transform unstructured documents into structured data. With Pipedream, you can harness this power to automate workflows, such as digitizing financial records, validating document data, or integrating extracted information into databases or other apps, all with minimal code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing**: Extract data from uploaded invoices using Docsumo, then use Pipedream to send the structured data to accounting software like QuickBooks for streamlined bookkeeping.

- **Expense Management Automation**: Capture receipt data with the Docsumo API and automatically create expense records in a platform such as Expensify or a Google Sheet, facilitating quick expense reporting and reimbursement.

- **Bank Statement Reconciliation**: Use Docsumo to parse bank statements and match transactions with records in your accounting system. This can be done by integrating the Docsumo API with Pipedream workflows that reconcile transactions in apps like Xero.
