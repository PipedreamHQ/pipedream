Event sources can also be deployed via the [Pipedream CLI](https://docs.pipedream.com/cli/reference/). Once installed, you can deploy an event source by running:

```bash
pd deploy   # prompts you to select a component and pass required options
```

## Workflows

Workflows are a sequence of linear [steps](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps) - just Node.js code - triggered by an event (via event source, HTTP endpoint, or timer). Workflows make it easy to transform data and integrate with 300+ APIs from various apps and services.

- Trigger your workflow on any [Github event](https://pipedream.com/sources/new?app=github), a different event (e.g. [HTTP requests](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps/triggers/#http) or a [schedule](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps/triggers/#cron-scheduler)).
- Add steps to run [Node.js code](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps/code/) (using virtually any npm package) and [pre-built actions](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps/actions/).
- Steps are executed in the order they appear in your workflow.
- Data is shared between steps via [step exports](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps/#step-exports).

Workflow code is [public by default](https://docs.pipedream.com/public-workflows/) so the community can discover and [copy them](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/copy/). Your workflow execution and event data is private.

You can copy [this example workflow](https://pipedream.com/@tod/use-http-requests-to-trigger-a-workflow-p_6lCy5y/readme) to get started, or review some [community-developed workflows](https://pipedream.com/explore) to see what others are building.
