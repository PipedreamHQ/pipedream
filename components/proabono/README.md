# Overview

ProAbono is a service built to manage subscription billing with fine-grained control over pricing, features, customers, and usage. With the ProAbono API, Pipedream can be your automation partner to streamline subscription operations. Use cases include synchronizing customer data, updating subscription details, and managing billing events. Pipedream's serverless platform allows you to trigger workflows on schedule, by webhook, or via other app events, making it ideal for integrating with ProAbono to handle complex subscription logic.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Customer Onboarding**: When a new customer signs up via your platform, Pipedream can automate the process of creating a new customer and subscription in ProAbono. Pair this with Slack to notify the team of new signups.

- **Sync Subscription Updates to CRM**: Maintain a single source of truth by updating customer subscription details in your CRM whenever a change occurs in ProAbono. Integrate with Salesforce or Hubspot to ensure sales and service teams are up-to-date.

- **Handle Failed Payments**: Set up a workflow to listen for failed payment events from ProAbono. When a payment fails, Pipedream can trigger an email campaign via SendGrid to alert the customer and provide instructions for updating payment information.
