# Overview

The SecurityTrails API offers a robust interface for accessing detailed domain and IP information, enabling users to perform comprehensive investigations and monitor cybersecurity threats. With this API, you can query historical DNS data, trace domain ownership changes, analyze IP neighbors, and much more, making it a powerful tool for IT security professionals and researchers.

# Example Use Cases

- **Threat Detection Automation**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers daily scans of your companyâ€™s domains using the SecurityTrails API. If unexpected DNS changes or suspicious newly registered domains (typo-squatted versions of your domain) are detected, automatically generate and send an alert email using the SendGrid app.

- **Real-time Alerting for Domain Infringements**: Monitor domain registrations that mimic your brand by setting up a workflow on Pipedream. Use the SecurityTrails API to search for domains that are similar to your trademarked names and configure triggers to send real-time alerts through Slack if potential infringements are found.

- **IP Block Monitoring and Reporting**: Create a Pipedream workflow to regularly check the neighboring IPs around your critical IP blocks using the SecurityTrails API. If new, unknown IPs are detected or if there are unexpected changes in the IP landscape, generate detailed reports and push them to Google Sheets for further review and archiving.
