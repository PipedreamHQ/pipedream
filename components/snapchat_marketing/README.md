# Overview

The Snapchat Marketing API provides powerful tools for managing advertising campaigns on one of the most popular social platforms among younger demographics. With this API, you can create, manage, and optimize ad campaigns, generate detailed performance reports, and leverage audience data for targeted marketing efforts. Integrating the Snapchat Marketing API with Pipedream allows you to automate these tasks, seamlessly connecting your Snapchat campaigns with other business tools to enhance efficiency and insights.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Campaign Reporting**: Set up a workflow that triggers daily to fetch campaign performance data from the Snapchat Marketing API. This data can then be sent to Google Sheets or a BI tool like Tableau using Pipedream's built-in connectors, providing regular insights and trends analysis without manual intervention.

- **Audience Sync for Targeted Ads**: Create a workflow that synchronizes your CRM contacts with Snapchat's audience data. Whenever a new contact is added to your CRM (e.g., Salesforce), the workflow automatically updates your Snapchat ad campaigns' target audiences through the API, ensuring that your ads are always reaching the most relevant users.

- **Real-Time Budget Adjustment**: Implement a workflow that monitors your spending on Snapchat ads in real-time through the API and compares it with your set budget in a tool like QuickBooks. If spending exceeds the predetermined threshold, the workflow can automatically adjust campaign budgets or pause certain ads to prevent overspending.
