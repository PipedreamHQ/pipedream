# Overview

The Snapchat Marketing API provides a programmable interface to interact with Snapchat's advertising tools. This API enables automated creation and management of ad campaigns, audience targeting, and performance analytics, which can be a boon for marketers seeking to streamline their Snapchat advertising workflows. Leveraging this API on Pipedream, users can create serverless workflows that automate repetitive tasks, integrate with other marketing tools, and dynamically respond to campaign performance data.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Ad Campaign Creation**: Utilize Pipedream to listen for new product listings on an eCommerce platform like Shopify. When a new product is listed, automatically create a corresponding ad campaign in Snapchat, including setting budgets, target demographics, and creative assets.

- **Dynamic Campaign Adjustment**: Set up a workflow that monitors campaign performance metrics through the Snapchat Marketing API. If the cost per acquisition (CPA) rises above a certain threshold, the workflow could adjust the bid amount or pause the campaign and send an alert to the marketing team via Slack or email.

- **Synchronize Audiences**: Implement a workflow that syncs email lists from a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) app like HubSpot with Snapchat's Custom Audiences. Periodically update the audience in Snapchat to ensure the most recent contacts are being targeted for upcoming ad campaigns.
