# Overview

The SMSTools API provides robust SMS capabilities that enable automated messaging for a variety of applications. Using Pipedream as an automation platform, you can integrate SMSTools to send alerts, notifications, or marketing messages triggered by events from numerous apps and data sources. This integration can help streamline communication processes, improve customer engagement, and enhance real-time interaction capabilities.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Alerts**: Automatically send SMS messages to customers when their support ticket status changes. This can be integrated with a customer support platform like Zendesk, where each ticket update triggers an SMS notification via SMSTools, keeping the customer informed throughout the resolution process.

- **Appointment Reminders**: Set up a workflow where upcoming appointments stored in Google Calendar trigger reminder SMS messages to clients 24 hours before the scheduled time. This ensures higher attendance rates and improves client satisfaction.

- **Promotional Campaigns**: Launch SMS-based promotional campaigns by integrating SMSTools with an eCommerce platform like Shopify. Trigger an SMS send-out when a new product is listed or a special sale starts, directly messaging customers who opted in for SMS notifications.
