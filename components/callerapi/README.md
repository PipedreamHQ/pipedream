# Overview

CallerAPI provides functionalities to integrate telephony features into apps, enabling actions such as making calls, sending texts, and managing telephony services programmatically. By using CallerAPI on Pipedream, you can automate processes that involve voice and SMS communications, enrich CRM data, or streamline customer support and outreach activities. Pipedreamâ€™s capabilities in handling APIs can turn these telecommunication features into powerful tools for real-time data processing and workflow automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Automation**: Automate incoming support call distribution. When a call comes into your business number, use CallerAPI to route the call based on caller ID or input to the appropriate support agent or department. Log the call details and any notes from the conversation directly into a CRM like Salesforce, all within Pipedream.

- **Event-Triggered SMS Notifications**: Set up workflows where specific events in your application trigger SMS notifications. For instance, when a new user signs up on your platform, use CallerAPI to send a welcome SMS or security code. This can help in enhancing user engagement and security.

- **Automated Survey Calls**: Create a workflow to conduct automated survey calls after a service appointment or product delivery. Use CallerAPI to place calls and log responses, which can be analyzed later. Integrate this data into tools like Google Sheets or Airtable on Pipedream for easy access and analysis.
