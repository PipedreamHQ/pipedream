# Overview

The Fidel API allows you to link credit and debit cards to specific offers or programs, track transactions in real-time, and receive event-driven data. It's a powerful tool for creating loyalty and reward programs, providing insights into customer spending patterns, and automating financial operations. With Pipedream, you can craft workflows that leverage Fidel API's capabilities to trigger actions, sync data, and connect with other apps for enhanced automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Transaction-Based Rewards Notifications**: When a customer makes a qualifying purchase with a linked card, you can use Fidel API with Pipedream to trigger an email or SMS, via SendGrid or Twilio, notifying them of the rewards they've earned. This keeps customers engaged and encourages repeat business.

- **Real-Time Spending Dashboards**: Sync transaction data from Fidel API to Google Sheets or a database like PostgreSQL on every new transaction. Use this data to power real-time dashboards that monitor spending patterns, reward redemptions, and program effectiveness.

- **Automated Expense Tracking**: For each transaction made on a company card, you could trigger a workflow that classifies the expense, creates a record in an accounting app like QuickBooks, and notifies the finance team via Slack or email. This streamlines expense management and ensures timely record-keeping.
