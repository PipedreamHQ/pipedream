# Overview

With the Microsoft SQL Server API on Pipedream, you can automate your database operations and create powerful integrations. This API allows you to execute queries, manage databases, and trigger actions based on data changes. Implementing workflows that react to database events, manipulate data, or synchronize SQL Server data with other services, becomes effortless with Pipedream's serverless platform.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Backup**: Create a workflow that triggers on a schedule to back up your SQL Server databases. Use Pipedream's built-in cron scheduler to run a SQL query that exports data to a secure location, such as an AWS S3 bucket, ensuring your data is regularly archived without manual intervention.

- **Real-Time Sales Dashboard**: Connect SQL Server to a dashboard app like Geckoboard. Use a workflow that runs SQL queries at regular intervals to fetch the latest sales data, then pushes that data to the dashboard for a real-time display of key sales metrics, giving your team immediate insights to drive decisions.

- **Email Alerts for Low Inventory**: Pair SQL Server with an email service like SendGrid. Set up a workflow that monitors inventory levels and, when stock for a particular item falls below a threshold, automatically sends an email alert to the procurement team, enabling timely restocking and avoiding stockouts.
