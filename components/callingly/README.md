# Overview

The Callingly API on Pipedream empowers you to automate call initiation and follow-ups, sync lead information, and manage user interactions in real-time. By leveraging Pipedream's serverless platform, you can seamlessly integrate Callingly with numerous other apps to streamline communication workflows, trigger calls based on specific actions, and analyze call data for insights.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Qualification Automation**: Trigger Callingly to initiate a call to a new lead as soon as they complete a form on your website. Use Pipedream to capture the form submission, perhaps from a service like Typeform, and automatically send the lead info to Callingly to start the call, ensuring immediate contact and increasing the chances of conversion.

- **Support Ticket Escalation**: When a support ticket in a system like Zendesk is marked as urgent, automatically trigger a Callingly call to the assigned support agent. This ensures that critical issues are communicated instantly, reducing response time and improving customer satisfaction.

- **CRM Integration for Sales Follow-up**: After a deal stage is updated in your CRM, such as HubSpot, use Pipedream to trigger a follow-up call via Callingly. This workflow can help sales teams stay on top of their pipelines by automating routine follow-ups, thus allowing more time to focus on closing deals.
