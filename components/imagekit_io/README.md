# Overview

ImageKit.io API lets you manage, optimize, and deliver images dynamically for your web applications. On Pipedream, you can integrate this API to construct serverless workflows that automate your image operations and connect with other services. You can upload images from various sources, apply real-time transformations, and track media assets without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Image Uploads**: Build a workflow that triggers every time a new image is added to a Dropbox folder, automatically uploading it to ImageKit.io, applying specified transformations, and then storing the optimized image URL in a Google Sheet.

- **Content Moderation**: Implement a content moderation flow that takes new images uploaded to ImageKit.io, sends them to an AI service like AWS Rekognition for analysis, and flags content that doesn't meet predefined safety standards.

- **Social Media Integration**: Create a workflow that listens for new posts on a CMS like WordPress, fetches the images from those posts, resizes and watermarks them using ImageKit.io, and then posts the optimized images to social media platforms like Twitter or Instagram.
