# Overview

The Reform API allows you to automate the management and analysis of forms and surveys. By connecting Reform to Pipedream, you can create, update, and retrieve form submissions, and set up workflows that trigger on new responses. This opens up possibilities for integrating form data with other tools, managing event-driven notifications, or feeding customer insights into your CRM systemsâ€”all in a serverless environment that scales with your needs.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Response Aggregation**: Collect submissions from a Reform form and aggregate them in a Google Sheet. Whenever a new form is submitted, a Pipedream workflow triggers, extracts the form data, and appends it to the Google Sheet, keeping records up-to-date without manual entry.

- **Dynamic CRM Updates**: Keep your CRM system in sync with customer feedback. Each time a Reform submission comes through, use Pipedream to parse the response and update the relevant customer profile in HubSpot, ensuring your sales and support teams have the latest information.

- **Slack Notification for Survey Responses**: Stay on top of user feedback by getting instant notifications. Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for new Reform submissions and sends a formatted message to a designated Slack channel, allowing your team to quickly react to customer insights or issues.
