# Overview

The Scraptio API enables seamless web scraping and data extraction from HTML content. With Scraptio on Pipedream, you can automate the collection of web data, monitor changes on websites, and integrate scraped data with other services. Pipedream's no-code platform enhances Scraptio's capabilities by allowing you to create workflows that trigger on schedules or events, process data, and connect to 3,000+ other apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Monitoring**: Pair Scraptio with Pipedream's cron job feature to periodically scrape website content. Use this workflow to track changes, such as price fluctuations or updates on competitor web pages, and send alerts via email or Slack when specific changes are detected.

- **Lead Generation and Enrichment**: Scrape professional directories or job listing sites with Scraptio to gather potential leads. Then, enrich this data using a service like Clearbit within Pipedream, and automatically add the enhanced lead information to a CRM like Salesforce.

- **News Aggregation**: Create a custom news feed by using Scraptio to extract headlines, summaries, and links from various news outlets. With Pipedream, aggregate these into a single data store, and then share the compiled news via a messaging app like Telegram or an email newsletter service.
