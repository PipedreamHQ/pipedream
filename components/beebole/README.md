# Overview

The Beebole (legacy) API provides programmatic access to time tracking, project management, and budgeting features within the Beebole platform. On Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate routine tasks, sync time entry data with other systems, and build custom workflows to streamline operations. Utilizing Pipedream's ability to connect to hundreds of other apps, you can enhance data flow between Beebole and other tools your team uses.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Timesheet Reporting**: Collect timesheet data from Beebole on a regular basis and send a formatted report via email or to a Slack channel. This keeps teams informed about project hours without manual data extraction.

- **Project Management Sync**: When a new project is added in a project management tool like Trello, automatically create a corresponding project in Beebole to align time tracking with project progress.

- **Budget Alert System**: Monitor the hours logged against projects in Beebole and trigger alerts via SMS using the Twilio app when a project approaches its budgeted hours, enabling proactive cost management.
