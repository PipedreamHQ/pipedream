# Overview

Moaform is an online survey tool that allows users to create, distribute, and analyze surveys, quizzes, and forms. Integrating Moaform with Pipedream opens up possibilities for automation, data integration, and enhanced workflow efficiencies. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can automatically process responses, integrate survey data with other business tools, and trigger actions based on respondent behavior, enhancing both data collection and analysis.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Survey Data Collection and Storage**: Collect responses from Moaform surveys and automatically store them in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This workflow triggers whenever a new response is received, extracting the data and appending it to the specified Google Sheets document. Ideal for teams needing real-time access to survey results for quick decision-making and analysis.

- **Customer Feedback to CRM Integration**: After a customer completes a feedback form on Moaform, use Pipedream to automatically update their record in a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. This can include adding a new note, updating satisfaction scores, or triggering follow-up tasks for account managers. This workflow enhances customer relationship management by ensuring that customer feedback directly informs their profile and service strategy.

- **Course Evaluation and Email Automation**: For educational institutions or training providers, automatically send a personalized thank-you email through SendGrid or Mailgun to participants who complete a course evaluation form. Additionally, based on the course rating, trigger specific emails offering additional resources, or ask for a testimonial if the rating is high. This workflow not only improves engagement but also leverages feedback to enhance course offerings.
