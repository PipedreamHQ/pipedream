# Overview

The MindMeister API lets you integrate real-time mind mapping into your projects. By connecting MindMeister to Pipedream, you can automate mind map creation, updates, and sharing processes. It's ideal for brainstorming sessions, project planning, and knowledge management. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can trigger workflows with HTTP requests, schedules, or app events, and connect MindMeister with 3,000+ other apps to streamline your tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Mind Maps with Calendar Events**: Before a scheduled meeting in Google Calendar, trigger a workflow that creates or updates a MindMeister mind map with the agenda or discussion points, and share the link with all participants.

- **Content Brainstorming Pipeline**: Collect ideas from a form submission via Typeform or Google Forms, and automatically populate them into a MindMeister mind map for content brainstorming and organization.
