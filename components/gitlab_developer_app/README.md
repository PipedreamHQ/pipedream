# Overview

The GitLab (Developer App) API on Pipedream allows you to automate your development workflow by connecting GitLab with other services and creating custom, serverless workflows. With this API, you can trigger actions on events in GitLab, like pushes, merge requests, or issues, and perform operations such as creating new commits, managing issues, or deploying code. It simplifies your DevOps cycle, offers extensive automation capabilities, and integrates with numerous third-party tools, all from within Pipedream's seamless integration platform.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Code Review Assignments**: When a new merge request is created in GitLab, the workflow can automatically assign a reviewer from a predefined list or based on file paths affected in the request. Notify the reviewer through Slack to streamline the process.

- **Issue Management and Tracking**: On the creation of a new issue in GitLab, create a corresponding task in Trello or Asana. Sync comments and status updates between GitLab and the project management tool to keep everyone on the same page without manual updates.

- **Continuous Deployment Pipeline**: Trigger a workflow when a push to the master branch in a GitLab repository occurs. Build the code using a CI tool like CircleCI, then deploy to a server or platform like AWS or Heroku. Finally, send a notification of the deployment's success or failure through email or a messaging app like Discord.
