# Overview

The InMobile API affords you the ability to automate and integrate SMS messaging services into your business workflows. Through Pipedream, you can craft serverless workflows that leverage these capabilities to interact with customers, send alerts, and integrate with other services for a seamless communication ecosystem. Harnessing the power of the InMobile API on Pipedream lets you send messages, manage contacts, and track message delivery within custom workflows, without the fuss of server maintenance.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Feedback Collection via SMS and Google Sheets**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow with a new row in a Google Sheet, which contains customer data. Use the InMobile API to send an SMS to these customers inviting feedback. Record the responses back into Google Sheets for data analysis and follow-up.

- **E-commerce Order Confirmation and Tracking**: Connect the InMobile API to an e-commerce platform like Shopify. When a new order is placed, trigger a workflow that sends an SMS confirmation to the customer. Follow up with delivery status updates via SMS as the order is processed and shipped.

- **IT Alert System with SMS Notifications**: Pair the InMobile API with monitoring tools such as Datadog. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers an SMS alert to IT personnel when a critical system anomaly is detected. This enables rapid response to maintain system uptime and reliability.
