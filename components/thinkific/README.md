# Overview

Thinkific's API opens a treasure trove of possibilities for automating and enhancing the e-learning experience. It provides programmatic access to your Thinkific site, allowing you to manage courses, users, enrollments, and more. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can connect Thinkific to a multitude of other applications, automate tasks, sync data across various services, and trigger workflows based on specific events, all without writing a line of server code.
