# Overview

The 8x8 Connect API offers robust capabilities for automating communication workflows, enabling the sending of SMS, MMS, and voice messages programmatically. By integrating this API on Pipedream, users can create powerful automations that enhance engagement, streamline notifications, and facilitate real-time interactions in varied business contexts. This integration allows for a seamless connection with other apps, enriching the utility of workflows by incorporating dynamic communication features.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Alerts**: Automate sending SMS notifications to customers for support ticket updates. When a ticket status changes in a support app like Zendesk, trigger an SMS via 8x8 Connect to keep the customer informed in real time.

- **Appointment Reminders**: Set up a workflow where appointment details from a Google Calendar event trigger reminder SMS messages to clients a day before their scheduled appointment, reducing no-shows and improving customer service.

- **Marketing Campaign Updates**: Send MMS messages with images or GIFs to subscribersâ€™ phones when a new product launches or a sale begins, using data from an e-commerce platform like Shopify to personalize the message content based on past purchase behavior.
