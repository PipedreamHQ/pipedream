# Overview

The Figma API unlocks the power to automate and integrate design workflows, enabling both designers and developers to extract assets, update designs, and manage files programmatically. By leveraging the Figma API on Pipedream, you can create automated processes that sync design updates with other tools, notify team members of changes, or feed design information into other parts of your digital ecosystem.

# Example Use Cases

- **Design Sync to Cloud Storage**: Automatically upload new versions of design files from Figma to a cloud storage provider like Google Drive or Dropbox when a file is updated. Keep your assets backed up and accessible to team members who don't use Figma.

- **Project Management Updates**: Trigger an update in your project management tool, such as Trello or Asana, when a Figma design file changes status. Ensure that project timelines and tasks are in sync with the design progress.

- **Slack Notifications on Comments**: Send a message to a designated Slack channel whenever a new comment is added to a Figma file. Keep your team informed and quickly actionable on feedback without leaving their communication hub.
