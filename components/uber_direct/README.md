# Overview

The Uber Direct API integrates on-demand delivery into your business, enabling real-time delivery solutions directly through Uber's platform. With this API, you can automate the dispatch of items, track deliveries in real-time, and manage orders efficiently. This integration is particularly useful for businesses needing to streamline their local delivery processes without managing their own fleet.

# Example Use Cases

- **Instant Order Dispatch Upon Payment Confirmation**: Automate the dispatch process in your e-commerce platform. When a customer makes a payment, trigger an Uber Direct delivery automatically. Connect the Uber Direct API with payment platforms like Stripe or PayPal on Pipedream to initiate delivery as soon as the payment is verified.

- **Scheduled Deliveries for Subscription Services**: For businesses offering subscription-based products, use the Uber Direct API to schedule deliveries based on the subscription plan. Set up workflows on Pipedream that check subscription statuses daily and coordinate deliveries through Uber Direct when products are due to be sent.

- **Real-Time Delivery Updates to Customers via SMS or Email**: Enhance customer satisfaction by sending real-time updates on delivery status. Use the Uber Direct API in conjunction with Twilio or SendGrid on Pipedream. When a delivery status changes, trigger an SMS or email to keep your customer informed every step of the way.
