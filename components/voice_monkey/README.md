# Overview

The Voice Monkey API provides a bridge between Alexa and Pipedream, enabling you to send custom announcements, notifications, or commands to your Alexa devices. With this API, you can trigger Alexa to speak a custom message or execute routines, leveraging the power of voice interaction in your automated workflows. It's particularly useful for smart home enthusiasts, productivity hackers, and businesses looking to integrate voice notifications into their services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Alexa Morning Briefing Automation:** Kickstart your day with an automated morning briefing. When your calendar shows a scheduled event, Pipedream can trigger the Voice Monkey API to have Alexa read out the day's agenda, weather forecast, and important news.
- **Smart Home Alert System:** Enhance your home security with voice alerts. Connect smart sensors to Pipedream, so when a sensor detects movement or opens a door, it prompts Alexa to announce a security alert through the Voice Monkey API.
- **Customer Support Notifications:** Integrate the Voice Monkey API with a customer support ticketing system like Zendesk. Whenever a high-priority support ticket is received, use Pipedream to trigger an announcement from Alexa to ensure immediate attention from your support team.
