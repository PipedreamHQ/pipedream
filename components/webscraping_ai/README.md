# Overview

WebScraping.AI API provides powerful tools for extracting data from websites, enabling users to retrieve structured information without the hassle of setting up a custom scraper. It handles proxy rotation, browsers, and CAPTCHAs, allowing you to focus on data collection. With Pipedream, you can harness this capability to create automated workflows that trigger on various events, process web content, and connect with countless other apps to feed data pipelines, monitor changes, or populate databases.

# Example Use Cases

- **Market Research Automation**: Gather pricing, product descriptions, and ratings from e-commerce sites. Use WebScraping.AI with Pipedream to scrape data at regular intervals, and connect to apps like Google Sheets to organize the data for analysis, or send it to a business intelligence tool for real-time dashboards.

- **Content Change Detection**: Monitor competitors' websites for content updates or changes. Set up a Pipedream workflow that scrapes specific pages daily with WebScraping.AI, compares it with the previous version stored in Pipedream's built-in data store, and sends alerts via Slack or Email when changes are detected.

- **Lead Generation Engine**: Extract contact information from online directories or professional networking sites. Use WebScraping.AI within a Pipedream workflow to capture leads and automatically add them to a CRM like HubSpot or Salesforce, or send the data to a marketing automation tool to initiate contact sequences.
