# Overview

The Samsung SmartThings API is an open platform that enables developers to
quickly and securely connect a wide range of devices, services, and
applications to the SmartThings smart home and connected environment. With the
API, you can integrate your SmartThings-compatible products with a range of
third-party services and applications for enhanced convenience, automation, and
