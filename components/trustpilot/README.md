# Overview

The Trustpilot (Customer) API lets you tap into the rich pool of customer review data on Trustpilot. You can use it to automate the process of collecting and managing reviews, responding to feedback, and analyzing customer sentiment. With Pipedream's integration, you can trigger workflows based on new reviews, aggregate review data for analysis, and sync Trustpilot data with other services like CRMs, support tickets, and marketing tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Manage New Reviews in Real Time**: When a new review is posted on Trustpilot, use Pipedream to trigger a workflow that sends a notification to a Slack channel or an email to the customer service team. This enables immediate acknowledgment or action concerning the customer's feedback.

- **Aggregate Reviews for Reporting**: Schedule a daily workflow on Pipedream that collects all the new reviews, summarizes the sentiment and star rating, and creates a report in Google Sheets. This allows for easy monitoring of customer satisfaction trends over time.

- **Automate Review Response**: Craft a workflow that, upon receiving a new review, checks the star rating. If it's below a certain threshold, automatically draft a response or create a support ticket in Zendesk to ensure that a customer service rep engages with the unhappy customer promptly.
