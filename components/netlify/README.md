# Overview

Harness the power of the Netlify API on Pipedream to automate your web development workflows, streamline site deployments, manage DNS settings, and more. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can orchestrate Netlify's capabilities in concert with numerous other services to enhance productivity, monitor your deployments, and react to events in real-time. Create custom CI/CD pipelines, synchronize your site's content with third-party systems, or automate responses to form submissions, all with the seamless integration of the Netlify API within Pipedream workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Deployment After Content Update**  
  Listen for updates in a CMS like Contentful or WordPress, and trigger a Netlify build to redeploy your site whenever new content is published or updated.

- **Dynamic DNS Management**  
  Combine Netlify with DNS services like Cloudflare or Google Cloud DNS in Pipedream. Automatically update DNS records when deploying new features, or manage subdomains for multi-tenant applications dynamically.

- **Form Submission Handling**  
  Capture form submissions on your Netlify-hosted site and process them in Pipedream. Integrate with email services like SendGrid to send auto-responses, or with Slack to notify your team about new entries.
