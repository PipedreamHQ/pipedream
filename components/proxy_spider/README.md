# Overview

The Proxy Spider API lets you scrape and gather data from the web without the usual hassle of IP blocks or CAPTCHAs. By leveraging Pipedream's integration capabilities, you can automate the extraction of web data and manage proxy pools seamlessly. This means you can focus on what to do with the data you gather, rather than worrying about the technicalities of acquiring it. Within Pipedream's serverless platform, you could set up workflows that trigger based on a variety of events and use the Proxy Spider API to fetch data as needed.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-time Price Monitoring**: Keep track of product prices across different e-commerce platforms. When a Pipedream schedule triggers the workflow, it can use Proxy Spider to scrape pricing information anonymously, and then save this data to a Google Sheet or send a notification if prices drop below a certain threshold.

- **Content Change Detection**: Monitor changes to the content of a critical webpage. Use Proxy Spider to scrape the page at regular intervals. If the content changes, trigger a workflow that alerts you via email or Slack. This can be vital for tracking updates on competitor websites or monitoring legal pages for compliance.

- **SEO Analysis Automation**: Automate the process of gathering SEO-relevant data from multiple websites. Combine Proxy Spider with an SEO analysis tool available on Pipedream, like Moz or Ahrefs. This workflow can periodically scrape required data and pass it to the SEO tool for a comprehensive report, helping you keep tabs on keyword rankings or backlink profiles.
