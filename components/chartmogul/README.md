# Overview

ChartMogul is an analytics platform designed to help subscription businesses analyze their revenue, churn, and other key performance indicators (KPIs). By leveraging the ChartMogul API, you can import, manipulate, and retrieve customer subscription data to gain insights into the financial health of your business. When used with Pipedream, you can automate complex workflows, combine subscription data with external tools, and react in real-time to changes in your subscription metrics.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Lifecycle Event Tracking**: Sync customer subscription events from ChartMogul to a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. Trigger workflows in Pipedream when a new subscription is created, a customer upgrades or downgrades their plan, or cancels their subscription. This data can be used to automate follow-up tasks, customer support tickets, and personalized marketing campaigns.

- **Real-Time Revenue Dashboards**: Create a real-time dashboard by sending ChartMogul revenue data to a Google Sheet using Pipedream's Google Sheets integration. Whenever there's a new invoice, payment, or refund, update the sheet to reflect changes in MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue), ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), or other custom metrics. Use this dashboard for immediate insights during team meetings or decision-making processes.

- **Automated Financial Reporting**: Combine ChartMogul metrics with additional financial data from tools like QuickBooks or Xero for comprehensive reporting. Set up a Pipedream workflow to run at the end of each accounting period, pull the necessary data from these services and ChartMogul, and generate a consolidated financial report. This can greatly reduce the manual effort required during the financial close process.
