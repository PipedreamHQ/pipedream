# Overview

The Orimon API provides tools to analyze and enrich image data, specifically focusing on detailed object recognition, extraction, and classification within images. This functionality can be leveraged in Pipedream to automate workflows that require image processing, enhancing applications such as content moderation, asset management, and automated cataloging.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Tagging for Digital Asset Management**: - Capture images uploaded to a Dropbox folder, use the Orimon API to analyze and tag the images with relevant metadata, and then store these tagged images in a database. This can streamline the organization and retrieval of digital assets.

- **Real-Time Moderation for User-Generated Content**: - When users upload photos to a platform like Instagram or a custom app, trigger a workflow that uses the Orimon API to detect any inappropriate content within the images. If such content is found, the workflow could automatically alert moderators or take predefined actions like removing the image or flagging the user.

- **Enhanced E-commerce Product Listings**: - Automatically extract product details from supplier images uploaded to Google Drive using the Orimon API. Populate these details into an e-commerce platform like Shopify to create rich, detailed product listings without manual data entry, enhancing the shopping experience and accuracy of product descriptions.
