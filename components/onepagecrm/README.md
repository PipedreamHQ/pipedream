# Overview

The OnePageCRM API enables interaction with your OnePageCRM account, automating your contact and sales management. With it, you can create, update, and delete contacts, deals, and notes, or trigger actions based on sales activities. When combined with Pipedream's serverless platform, this API allows you to connect OnePageCRM with 3,000+ other apps to streamline your sales process, enhance lead generation, and improve follow-ups.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Contacts to a Google Sheet**: Automatically add new contacts created in OnePageCRM to a Google Sheet, allowing for easy sharing and analysis. Each time a contact is added in OnePageCRM, a Pipedream workflow triggers and appends their details to a designated Google Sheet.

- **Create Contacts from Inbound Emails**: Convert incoming emails to OnePageCRM contact entries. Using Pipedream's Email Trigger, whenever you receive a new email to a specific address, parse the sender's details and create a new contact in OnePageCRM, ensuring you never lose a lead.

- **Post Slack Notifications for Won Deals**: Keep your team instantly informed when deals are won. Set up a Pipedream workflow that monitors deal statuses in OnePageCRM; when a deal is marked as won, trigger a notification to a specified Slack channel celebrating the success with your team.
