# Overview

The Docmosis API lets you generate custom documents based on templates. You can populate these templates with dynamic content and convert them into various formats such as PDF, Word, and HTML. On Pipedream, leveraging the Docmosis API in your workflows allows automated document generation, making it ideal for reports, contracts, invoices, and more. You can trigger workflows with various events and use data from other apps to fill templates.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Generation**: When a new order is received in Shopify, you can trigger a Pipedream workflow to collect order data and send it to Docmosis to generate an invoice. The workflow could then email the invoice to the customer and update the order status in Shopify.

- **Dynamic Contract Creation**: Upon a new lead in Salesforce, you can automatically create a custom contract using Docmosis. The workflow could fill a template with lead data, generate the contract, and upload the signed version back to Salesforce once completed.

- **Monthly Report Compilation**: At the end of each month, gather data from Google Sheets, process the data in Pipedream, and pass the relevant information to Docmosis to generate a comprehensive report. You might then save this report to Google Drive and notify your team via Slack.
