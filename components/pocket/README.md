# Overview

Pocket's API on Pipedream allows for the automation of content curation workflows. Users can add, retrieve, and organize articles, videos, or other content they want to view later. By leveraging the API, you can create systems for tagging and sorting saved items, integrating them with other services for further processing or sharing. This could be useful for content creators, researchers, or anyone needing to manage a large influx of information efficiently.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Digest Email Automation**: Trigger a weekly Pipedream workflow that fetches items saved in Pocket over the past week. Use the retrieved list to generate an HTML email digest through the SendGrid app and send it to a curated list of subscribers, keeping them updated with your latest finds.

- **Social Media Sharing Scheduler**: Create a workflow where new items saved to Pocket with a specific tag (e.g., 'share') automatically get scheduled for posting on social media platforms like Twitter or LinkedIn. Use the Twitter app within Pipedream to handle the posting, adding custom messages or hashtags for each item.

- **Research Resource Aggregator**: Set up a workflow that watches for new Pocket items tagged with specific research-related keywords and automatically adds them to a Google Sheets document. This workflow facilitates collaborative research by providing a live, shared resource list that team members can access and update.
