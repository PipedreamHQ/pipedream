# Overview

The Epic Games API offers a suite of functionalities that allows developers to interact with Epic Games' services, including game libraries, player data, and store operations. With Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate tasks, sync data between Epic Games and other platforms, and enhance gaming experiences or streamline game administration tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Sales Notification**: Build a workflow on Pipedream that monitors specific games in the Epic Games Store for discounts or sales. This can be paired with notifications via email or SMS (using Twilio) to alert subscribers immediately when their favorite games are on sale.

- **Sync Player Stats to Google Sheets**: Create a workflow where player statistics and achievements are fetched from the Epic Games API and logged in a Google Sheets document. This can be useful for community managers or game teams who need to keep track of player progress and leaderboards without manual data entry.

- **Game Release Webhook**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that uses the Epic Games API to check for new game releases. When a new game is added to the store, the workflow triggers and sends a customized webhook to a Discord server to notify your community.
