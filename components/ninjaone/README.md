# Overview

NinjaOne offers a unified IT management solution, allowing users to automate and streamline IT tasks such as device management, monitoring, and security. Through its API, you can access and manipulate data related to devices, users, alerts, and more. Using Pipedream, you can integrate NinjaOne with other apps to automate IT workflows, enhance data synchronization, and respond dynamically to events in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Ticket Creation for Alerts**: When NinjaOne detects a critical system alert, an automated workflow on Pipedream triggers the creation of a ticket in a service like Zendesk or Jira. This ensures immediate attention from support teams without manual intervention.

- **Sync New Devices to Asset Management Systems**: Each time a new device is registered in NinjaOne, Pipedream can automatically add this device's details to an asset management system like Snipe-IT. This keeps asset records up-to-date and helps in efficient asset tracking and management.

- **Periodic IT Security Reports**: Configure a Pipedream workflow to periodically fetch the latest security audit logs from NinjaOne and send a formatted report via email using SendGrid or save it to Google Drive. This aids in maintaining regular oversight of IT security health.
