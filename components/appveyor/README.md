# Overview

The AppVeyor API grants programmatic access to AppVeyor's continuous integration and deployment services, empowering developers to trigger builds, fetch build history, deploy applications, and manage projects and account settings. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can craft custom workflows that react to AppVeyor events or manipulate AppVeyor's pipeline dynamically, streamlining your CI/CD process by interfacing with other tools in the software development lifecycle.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Deployment Triggering:** When a new tag is pushed to your GitHub repository, a Pipedream workflow can automatically trigger a new build in AppVeyor, ensuring that your latest code is always being deployed without manual intervention.

- **Dynamic Build Notifications:** Configure a workflow on Pipedream to listen for build status webhook events from AppVeyor. Upon build completion, whether successful or failed, automatically send detailed notifications through Slack, Discord, or even SMS, keeping your team informed in real-time.

- **Project Synchronization and Backups:** Use Pipedream to periodically call AppVeyor's API to fetch the configuration of all projects. Store this data in a Google Sheet or sync it to a GitHub repository to maintain a backup of your CI/CD configuration, making disaster recovery smooth and quick.
