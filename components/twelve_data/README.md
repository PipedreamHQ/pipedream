# Overview

The Twelve Data API provides access to real-time and historical stock market data, making it a powerful tool for financial analysis and trading strategy development. With this API, users can retrieve stock prices, forex data, indicators, and more, delivering the necessary information to monitor market trends closely. On Pipedream, you can leverage this data to create custom, serverless workflows that react to market changes, automate trading analysis, or integrate financial data into other apps and services for informed decision-making.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Trading Signals**: Set up a workflow that monitors specific indicators or stock price thresholds. When certain conditions are met, you could trigger trade execution through a brokerage API or send a notification to execute a manual trade.

- **Market Trend Dashboard**: Create a workflow to fetch market data at regular intervals, updating a live dashboard. Integrate with Google Sheets or Data Studio to visualize the data for quick analysis, enabling you to spot trends or market movements as they happen.

- **Sentiment Analysis Alerts**: Combine Twelve Data API with a sentiment analysis service to gauge market sentiment on particular stocks or the market overall. When sentiment shifts significantly, trigger alerts through email or messaging services like Slack to inform stakeholders or adjust trading strategies promptly.
