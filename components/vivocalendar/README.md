# Overview

Vivocalendar API lets you interact with the Vivocalendar platform to manage events, calendars, and reminders. Within Pipedream, you can use this API to automate tasks, sync data across different calendar services, or create personalized notifications that fit into your workflow. Leveraging Pipedream's ability to integrate with numerous services, you can build custom automations that trigger on calendar events, process data, and perform actions in response.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Event Creation from Emails**: Scan incoming Gmail for specific keywords and automatically create events in Vivocalendar. This workflow would use the Gmail integration on Pipedream to trigger upon receiving new emails, parse the content for details, and create an event via the Vivocalendar API.

- **Sync Vivocalendar with Google Calendar**: Keep your Google Calendar in sync with Vivocalendar. Each new event added to Vivocalendar can be mirrored to Google Calendar, and vice versa. This ensures that you never miss an event because you were checking the wrong calendar. The workflow can be set up using Pipedream's built-in Google Calendar app alongside the Vivocalendar API.

- **Daily Event Digest to Slack**: Send a daily digest of your Vivocalendar events to a Slack channel. Pipedream's cron scheduler can trigger this workflow every day, fetching the day's events from Vivocalendar and formatting a message that is then sent to your chosen Slack channel using the Slack app integration.
