# Overview

Teamleader Focus API lets you integrate your Teamleader account's features with Pipedream, enabling automation of various business processes. You can create, update, fetch, and manage data concerning contacts, companies, deals, projects, invoices, and tasks. Automating these aspects via Pipedream can streamline workflows, trigger actions based on events, and connect Teamleader Focus with other apps to enhance productivity.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Contacts to Google Sheets**: When a new contact is added in Teamleader Focus, trigger a workflow in Pipedream to append the contact's details to a Google Sheet. This keeps your records in sync and allows for easy sharing and analysis of contact data.

- **Send Slack Notifications for New Deals**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for new deals in Teamleader Focus. When a deal is created, automatically send a notification to a designated Slack channel, keeping your team instantly informed about sales progress.

- **Automate Invoice Creation and Emailing**: Whenever a project is marked as completed in Teamleader Focus, trigger a Pipedream workflow to generate an invoice for the project, and then email it to the client using an email service like SendGrid. This automates billing processes and ensures timely payment requests.
