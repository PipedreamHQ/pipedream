# Overview

The ExhibitDay API allows you to interact with ExhibitDay's event planning and trade show management features programmatically. Using this API within Pipedream, you can automate tasks like synchronizing event data, managing trade show inventory, and tracking your team's performance at events. By leveraging Pipedream's connectivity, you can trigger workflows based on new events, updates, or specific conditions that you define, streamlining your event management process.

# Example Use Cases

- **Synchronize ExhibitDay Events with Google Calendar**: Automate the process of adding new events from ExhibitDay to a Google Calendar. Whenever a new trade show or event is added in ExhibitDay, Pipedream triggers a workflow to create an equivalent event in a specified Google Calendar, ensuring your schedule is always up-to-date.

- **Automate Lead Follow-Up Emails**: After an event concludes, use ExhibitDay's API to fetch attendee data and send personalized follow-up emails via a service like SendGrid. Pipedream can automate this flow, sending out thank you messages or further engagement materials, helping to solidify connections made during the event.

- **Sync Trade Show Inventory with a Database**: Keep your inventory management system in sync with ExhibitDay. Whenever inventory items are checked out or returned in ExhibitDay, Pipedream triggers a workflow to update the corresponding records in a connected database such as Airtable, maintaining accurate inventory levels in real-time.
