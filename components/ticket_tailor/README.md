# Overview

The Ticket Tailor API lets you tap into your event management toolkit, giving you the power to automate tasks like syncing attendee lists, sending custom emails after ticket purchase, and monitoring real-time event metrics. Leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can build workflows that respond to events in Ticket Tailor, such as new bookings, and connect these triggers to countless other apps to streamline your event management process and enhance attendee experience.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Attendee Welcome Messages**: Once a new ticket is purchased via Ticket Tailor, trigger an automated workflow on Pipedream that sends a personalized welcome email through SendGrid or another email service. This can include event details, links to additional resources, or exclusive offers.

- **Real-time Event Dashboards**: Create a Pipedream workflow that listens for new ticket sales in Ticket Tailor and updates a Google Sheets or Airtable base in real-time. This allows for live tracking of ticket sales data, attendee demographics, and revenue for swift analytical insights and reporting.

- **Post-Event Feedback Collection**: After an event concludes, use Pipedream to trigger a feedback survey dispatch through apps like Typeform or SurveyMonkey. This can be set to automatically send a certain time after the event ends, collecting valuable attendee insights to inform future events.
