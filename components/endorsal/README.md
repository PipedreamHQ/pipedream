# Overview

The Endorsal API provides a way to programmatically manage and showcase customer testimonials. With Pipedream, you can automate the collection and display of endorsements, sync these testimonials with other marketing tools, and trigger actions based on new reviews. This seamless integration enables you to leverage customer feedback effectively to boost your brand's credibility and visibility.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Testimonial Collection**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for a new customer sign-up via your CRM (e.g., Salesforce), then automatically sends a request for a testimonial to the customer through the Endorsal API.

- **Sync Testimonials with Marketing Platforms**: When a new testimonial is received, use Pipedream to post it to your social media channels like Twitter or LinkedIn, or update your website's testimonial section in real time.

- **Monitor and Alert for New Reviews**: Create a Pipedream workflow that checks for new Endorsal testimonials and sends an alert through Slack or email to your marketing team, so they can review and act quickly on the latest customer feedback.
