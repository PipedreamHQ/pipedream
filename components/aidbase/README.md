# Overview

The Aidbase API offers a plethora of functions for managing humanitarian aid projects. It enables the creation, tracking, and analysis of projects, donations, and resources. On Pipedream, a platform designed for building automated workflows seamlessly integrating various apps, Aidbase can be particularly powerful for non-profits and humanitarian organizations looking to streamline their operations through automation and data integrations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Donation Tracking**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that triggers whenever a new donation is received via Aidbase API. Automatically log this donation in a Google Sheets for real-time tracking and summarization. Send an acknowledgment email to the donor using the Gmail service, enhancing donor engagement and retention.

- **Resource Allocation Alerts**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that monitors resource allocation within Aidbase. Whenever resources drop below a certain threshold, trigger an alert via Slack to prompt immediate procurement or redistribution. This workflow helps in maintaining optimal resource levels to ensure uninterrupted aid distribution.

- **Project Progress Reports**: Automate the generation of regular project progress reports using the Aidbase API on Pipedream. Schedule a workflow that pulls the latest project data, formats it into a comprehensive report using a tool like Markdown, and then distributes the report via email or uploads it to a shared Dropbox folder. This ensures stakeholders are continually updated, promoting transparency and accountability.
