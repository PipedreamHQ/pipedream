# Overview

The Flexie API offers a powerful way to leverage customer relationship management (CRM) functionality within automated workflows. With the Flexie API, you can create, retrieve, update, and delete records, such as leads, contacts, and deals. You can also automate communication with leads via email or SMS, manage tasks and appointments, and create custom workflows to streamline your sales process.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Score Update to Email Notification**: When a lead's score reaches a certain threshold in Flexie, trigger an email notification to the sales team using the Gmail app on Pipedream. This instantly informs your sales reps about high-potential leads that require immediate attention.

- **New Deal Alert via SMS**: Set up a workflow where a new deal creation in Flexie automatically sends an SMS through the Twilio app to the assigned salesperson. This ensures that they are instantly aware of new opportunities to follow up on, no matter where they are.

- **Contact Sync to Google Sheets**: Maintain an up-to-date list of contacts by syncing new or updated contact records from Flexie to a Google Sheets document. This workflow can be used for reporting, auditing, or as an easy-to-access contact directory for other departments.
