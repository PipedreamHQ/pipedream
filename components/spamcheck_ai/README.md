# Overview

SpamCheck.ai is an API designed to assess and score the spamminess of email content. By integrating this tool on Pipedream, users can automate checks on outbound emails, streamline communication efficiency, and enhance email deliverability. This API evaluates email texts to provide spam scores, which can be pivotal in adjusting email strategies to avoid spam filters and improve the overall success rates of email campaigns.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Email Campaign Quality Control**: Before sending out mass email campaigns via services like SendGrid or Mailchimp, use SpamCheck.ai in a Pipedream workflow to analyze and score emails. If the spam score is above a certain threshold, adjust the email or trigger a review process.

- **Customer Support Email Monitoring**: Ensure that responses sent through customer support platforms (like Zendesk or Freshdesk) do not unintentionally trigger spam flags. Use SpamCheck.ai in a workflow to scan outgoing messages and alert team members when a high spam score is detected.

- **Real-Time Notification for High Spam Scores**: Set up a Pipedream workflow where SpamCheck.ai continuously monitors outbound emails sent by your team. If a high spam score is detected, automatically notify the sender or a supervisor via Slack or email, providing them the opportunity to revise the message before re-sending.
