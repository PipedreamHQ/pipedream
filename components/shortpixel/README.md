# Overview

The ShortPixel API is a powerful tool for optimizing images and PDFs to improve website load times and performance without sacrificing quality. With the ShortPixel API on Pipedream, you can build automated workflows that trigger image optimization processes, handle optimized data, and integrate this functionality with other apps. Pipedream's serverless platform allows for creating scalable and maintenance-free workflows, turning manual image optimization into automated, seamless operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Website Image Optimization**: Set up a workflow where every new image uploaded to your cloud storage (like AWS S3) is automatically sent to ShortPixel for optimization, then the optimized image is saved back in the storage with improved load times for your website's visitors.

- **Scheduled Bulk Image Optimization**: Create a workflow that periodically scans a specific folder in your Google Drive or Dropbox for new images, sends them to ShortPixel for optimization, and then replaces the original with the optimized versions or stores them in a separate "optimized" folder.

- **Dynamic Email Campaigns with Optimized Images**: Integrate ShortPixel in a workflow where images uploaded to a CMS are optimized and then dynamically inserted into outgoing email campaigns via an email service like SendGrid, ensuring fast-loading emails that enhance user engagement and conversion rates.
