# Overview

The WebScraper.IO API allows you to programmatically perform web scraping tasks, extracting structured data from websites. With the API, you can automate the gathering of web content for analysis, monitoring, and integration with other data sources. In Pipedream, you can leverage this API to build workflows that process, analyze, and act on the data you scrape without writing code for backend infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Aggregation**: Build a workflow that triggers at regular intervals to scrape content from multiple news sites or blogs, then compile the results into a single data store within Pipedream. You could then use this aggregated data for content analysis or send a daily digest via email.

- **Price Monitoring System**: Create a Pipedream workflow that uses WebScraper.IO to monitor product prices on e-commerce websites. The workflow can trigger notifications or take action when prices drop below a certain threshold. Connect the workflow with the Twilio app to send SMS alerts to subscribers or stakeholders.

- **Competitor Analysis Pipeline**: Develop a pipeline that scrapes competitor websites for new product launches or content updates using WebScraper.IO. Integrate the scraped data with Google Sheets or Airtable on Pipedream to maintain an up-to-date comparison database, which can inform strategic business decisions.
