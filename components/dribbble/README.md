# Overview

The Dribbble API unlocks the design world of Dribbble, letting you tap into a community of graphic designers, illustrators, and artists. By integrating with the API via Pipedream, you can automate tasks like tracking user stats, exploring popular shots, and posting updates automatically. With Pipedream's no-code platform, you can connect Dribbble to hundreds of other apps to streamline your design workflow, get insights, and engage with the design community.

# Example Use Cases

- **Auto-Post Design Updates**: Automatically post new shots or updates to your Dribbble account whenever new designs are added to your cloud storage platform, like Google Drive or Dropbox, keeping your portfolio fresh and up to date.

- **Monitor Brand Mentions**: Keep tabs on your brand by setting up a workflow that listens for mentions or tags of your company in Dribbble comments or shots. Trigger actions like sending a Slack message to your marketing team to engage with the community or compile brand mentions for analysis.

- **Weekly Design Digest**: Create a weekly digest of popular Dribbble shots based on likes, comments, or categories. Aggregate this content and send it as an email through SendGrid or post it to a company communication platform like Confluence to inspire your design team or keep stakeholders informed on design trends.
