# Overview

Propeller API offers a powerful suite of e-commerce tools enabling businesses to streamline their online sales processes. With the Propeller API, you can manage products, orders, customers, and inventory in real-time. Automating these e-commerce operations through Pipedream allows for seamless integration with other services, such as CRMs, email marketing platforms, and accounting software, to create a cohesive ecosystem for your online business.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Order Fulfillment Workflow**: When a new order is placed via Propeller, trigger a Pipedream workflow to capture the order details. The workflow can then notify the warehouse to ship the product, update the inventory, and send an order confirmation email to the customer using a service like SendGrid.

- **Customer Data Synchronization**: Whenever a new customer is added in Propeller, use Pipedream to synchronize this data with a CRM platform like Salesforce. The workflow would transfer customer details such as name, contact information, and purchase history to maintain updated records across both systems.

- **Real-time Inventory Management**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to monitor changes in inventory levels on Propeller. Connect this with Slack or another messaging app to send instant alerts when stock for a popular item is low, ensuring timely restocking and preventing lost sales due to out-of-stock items.
