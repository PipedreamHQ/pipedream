# Overview

The Sifter API enables developers to build custom solutions that leverage data
from the Sifter bug tracking system. With the API, developers can create
actions and integrations that enables Sifter to interact with other
applications, making Sifter even more powerful and customizable.

The following are some examples of what can be built using the Sifter API:

- Custom dashboards that allow users to view and interact with Sifter data.
- Automated solutions to create, modify, and close Sifter issues without manual
  intervention.
- Browser plug-ins that allow for auto-complete when entering Sifter data.
- Mobile apps that allow users to work with Sifter on the go.
- Add-ons that help make Sifter more accessible to users with disabilities.
- Custom tools that facilitate data import and export between Sifter and other
  applications.
