# Overview

SlickText provides a platform to harness the power of text messaging for marketing and communication purposes. With its API, you can automate the sending of SMS messages, manage contacts, and track message performance directly through Pipedream. Pipedream's serverless execution model and vast connectivity with other apps make it an ideal environment to build complex messaging workflows, enriching communications with data from CRMs, customer support platforms, and marketing tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **SMS Marketing Automation**: Trigger a SlickText SMS campaign when a new subscriber is added to a Mailchimp mailing list. This can help bridge the gap between email and SMS marketing, ensuring that your audience receives your message through their preferred channel.

- **Event-Triggered Text Alerts**: Send text messages via SlickText when specific events occur in your web application. For instance, set up a workflow that sends a discount code via SMS when a customer signs up on your website, leveraging apps like Stripe for payment events, or Shopify for e-commerce interactions.

- **Customer Feedback Collection**: Collect customer feedback by sending automated surveys after a purchase. When a new order is detected in Square, trigger a SlickText message with a survey link. The responses can be collected and aggregated in Google Sheets for analysis, allowing for real-time customer sentiment analysis.
