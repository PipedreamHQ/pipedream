# Overview

The Trust API empowers developers to automate and streamline various aspects of customer trust and safety operations. From verifying user identities to managing sensitive data compliance, Trust API provides tools that can be integrated into existing systems to enhance security and operational efficiency. Leveraging this API on Pipedream allows you to create powerful, automated workflows that connect Trust with other apps and services, enabling scalable and dynamic responses to trust and safety issues.

# Example Use Cases

- **User Verification Automation**: Upon new user registration in your application, automatically trigger a workflow on Pipedream that uses the Trust API to verify the userâ€™s identity. This can be further enhanced by connecting to email services like SendGrid to send confirmation or alert emails based on the verification results.

- **Compliance Check on User Data**: Construct a Pipedream workflow that periodically checks your database (e.g., using Airtable or Google Sheets) for new entries, then uses the Trust API to ensure that all new data complies with global compliance standards. If discrepancies or issues are found, the workflow can automatically log details to a Slack channel dedicated to compliance management.

- **Automated Data Anonymization**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream that listens for specific triggers from your applications, like a user requesting data anonymization. The workflow then uses the Trust API to anonymize personal data and updates the user records in your database systems such as PostgreSQL, ensuring privacy and adherence to data protection laws.
