# Overview

The Trust API provides tools for secure, real-time identity verification, which can be crucial for businesses needing to confirm user identities efficiently. This API supports various verification methods, including document scanning, biometric analysis, and background checks. Integrating the Trust API with Pipedream allows the automation of identity verification processes, user validation for financial transactions, or even streamlining onboarding processes by automating background checks.

# Example Use Cases

- **User Verification Automation**: Automatically verify new usersâ€™ identities as they register on your platform. When a new user signs up, trigger a workflow in Pipedream that submits their provided documents to the Trust API for verification. Once verified, you can automatically update their user status in your database and send a confirmation email.

- **Enhanced Security for Financial Transactions**: Integrate Trust API with transaction processing to add an extra layer of security. Before processing high-value transactions, use a Pipedream workflow to trigger a biometric verification request through Trust API. Only proceed with the transaction if the verification is successful, thereby reducing fraud.

- **Streamlined Background Checks for New Employees**: Simplify the hiring process by automating background checks using the Trust API. Set up a Pipedream workflow that initiates a background check when a new candidate is moved to the "offer" stage in your HR management system. The results can be automatically sent to the hiring manager and HR system, speeding up the decision-making process.
