# Overview

The SERPhouse API provides a way to fetch real-time search engine results pages (SERPs) from Google and Bing. With it, you can gather SEO data, monitor keyword rankings, and gain insights into search trends. On Pipedream, you can leverage this API to build serverless workflows that automate SEO tasks, conduct competitive analysis, and integrate with other apps to enhance your digital marketing strategies.

# Example Use Cases

- **Track Keyword Rankings**: Set up a scheduled workflow on Pipedream that uses the SERPhouse API to check the rankings of your website's keywords daily. Collect this data in a Google Sheets document for easy tracking and visualization of your SEO performance over time.

- **Monitor Competitor SEO Strategies**: Create a workflow that detects changes in SERP features (like Featured Snippets, People Also Ask, etc.) for competitor keywords. When changes are detected, send an alert via Slack to keep your marketing team informed and reactive to shifts in the SEO landscape.

- **Analyze Search Trends for Content Creation**: Use SERPhouse API to fetch popular queries and topics related to your business. Pipe this data into an AI text generation service, like OpenAI's GPT-3 on Pipedream, to generate content ideas or even draft initial content outlines based on trending search terms.
