# Overview

Synthflow is a fine-tuning AI platform that allows developers to enhance their machine learning models with minimal effort. Through the Synthflow API, users can automate and optimize the training and deployment of these models right from Pipedream. This integration enables seamless connections with other APIs, databases, or services, turning complex ML operations into manageable, automated tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Model Retraining and Notification**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream that triggers a periodic retraining of your machine learning model using Synthflow API whenever new data becomes available in your connected database (like PostgreSQL). Post-retraining, send notifications with updates or results directly to a Slack channel to keep the team informed.

- **Dynamic Model Adjustment Based on Feedback**: Implement a workflow where customer feedback collected via a service like Typeform automatically adjusts or retrains models in Synthflow. Use conditions within Pipedream to analyze feedback sentiment (using a tool like the Sentiment Analysis API) and trigger model adjustments when negative feedback trends are detected.

- **Real-time Data Processing and Model Optimization**: Stream real-time data from IoT devices into Synthflow via Pipedream. Use this data to continually fine-tune your models. Connect with a visualization tool like Google Sheets or Tableau through Pipedream to create dynamic dashboards that reflect model performance and adjustments over time.
