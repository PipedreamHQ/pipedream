# Overview

The IntelliHR API offers a gateway to a comprehensive human resource management system, focusing on performance, analytics, and automation. It enables developers to integrate various aspects of HR management, such as employee data, performance reviews, and training records, into their own applications or workflows. Using the API on Pipedream, one can seamlessly connect IntelliHR with other services to automate tasks, sync data, and create responsive HR solutions that operate in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Employee Onboarding Processes**: Streamline the onboarding of new hires by creating a Pipedream workflow that triggers on new employee records in IntelliHR. The workflow can send out welcome emails, schedule training sessions, and assign tasks in project management tools like Asana or Trello automatically.

- **Sync Employee Data with Payroll Services**: Ensure employee data is consistent across platforms by crafting a workflow that listens for updates in IntelliHR, then syncs changed details to a payroll service like Gusto or ADP. This can include updates to personal information, job positions, or salary changes, maintaining data integrity without manual intervention.

- **Generate Custom Reports and Alerts**: Design a workflow that aggregates data from IntelliHR, such as performance metrics or attendance records, and feeds it into a reporting tool like Google Sheets or Tableau. Set up alerts that notify managers via Slack or email when specific thresholds are met, enabling timely responses to HR insights.
