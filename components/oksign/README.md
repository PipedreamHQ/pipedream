# Overview

The OKSign API unlocks the potential to automate electronic signature workflows, streamlining the process of collecting legally binding signatures on documents. With this API, you can create signature requests, send documents to signees, and track the status of these documents, all programmatically. When leveraged through Pipedream, OKSign can be integrated with a vast array of apps to trigger actions, handle document flow, and ensure seamless end-to-end document management within your business processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Contract Automation for Sales**: Integrate OKSign with a CRM like Salesforce on Pipedream. Automate the sending of sales contracts when a new opportunity reaches a certain stage. Set up a workflow that listens for stage changes, then triggers a signature request for the related contract template in OKSign, and sends it to the customer for signing.

- **Employee Onboarding Documents**: Connect OKSign with an HR platform like BambooHR. Automate the distribution of onboarding paperwork to new hires. When a new employee record is created, a Pipedream workflow can fetch the necessary documents and send them through OKSign for e-signature, then store the signed documents back in the HR system.

- **Legal Document Approval Process**: Use OKSign with email services like Gmail on Pipedream. When a legal document is ready for review, a workflow can dispatch the document from a designated email to the relevant parties via OKSign. Once signed, the workflow can send a confirmation email to the involved parties and update any project management tools like Trello with the document's completion status.
