# Overview

The Microsoft Power BI API allows you to interact with your Power BI assets programmatically. With this API, you can embed your reports and dashboards into applications, manage Power BI datasets, push data into datasets for real-time dashboard updates, and automate your reporting workflows. On Pipedream, you can use this API to create intricate workflows that react to various triggers, like webhooks or schedules, and perform actions like refreshing datasets, posting to datasets, and managing Power BI assets.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Refresh**: Trigger a dataset refresh in Power BI whenever new data is received from a web service or when a file is uploaded to a cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox. This keeps your Power BI dashboards updated with the latest data without manual intervention.

- **Real-Time Dashboard Updates**: Push data to a Power BI streaming dataset from various sources like IoT devices, payment gateways, or CRMs such as Salesforce. Every time a new event occurs, the workflow pushes the data to Power BI, allowing for real-time dashboard updates and analytics.

- **Dynamic Report Generation**: Generate and distribute custom Power BI reports automatically based on user actions or time-based triggers. For instance, on the completion of a project, trigger a workflow that fetches relevant data from a project management tool like Asana, generates a report in Power BI, and then emails it to stakeholders.
