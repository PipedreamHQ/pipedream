# Overview

The HeroBot Chatbot Marketing API lets you interact with the HeroBot platform to manage and deliver chatbot services. With this API, you can automate conversations, broadcast messages, and gather insights from chatbot interactions. Pipedream's serverless platform enables you to create workflows integrating HeroBot with other apps, triggering actions based on events, and processing data without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Broadcast Messages Based on External Triggers**: Automate the process of sending broadcast messages through your HeroBot chatbot when triggered by external events, such as a new email subscriber, a completed survey, or a customer support ticket update.

- **Chatbot Analytics to Google Sheets**: Collect and send chatbot interaction data to Google Sheets for analysis. Each time a conversation ends or reaches a milestone, append the relevant data to a Google Sheet for tracking performance, user feedback, or common queries.

- **Sync Chatbot Contacts with CRM**: Keep your CRM up-to-date by syncing new contacts collected by your HeroBot chatbot. Whenever a user provides their details, create or update their record in your CRM, ensuring your sales team has the latest information for follow-ups.
