# Overview

The Neon API provides powerful interaction with Neon's infrastructure, which includes secure handling of API keys and other sensitive data. On Pipedream, you can leverage these capabilities to automate workflows around key management, data security, and infrastructure scaling. By connecting the Neon API with other services and apps, you can create automatic processes for issuing, rotating, and monitoring API keys, ensuring your applications maintain robust security and compliance without manual oversight.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated API Key Rotation**: Generate new API keys and deactivate old ones periodically to maintain security. Use Pipedream's built-in cron job feature to schedule these rotations, and automatically update the keys in other services like AWS or Stripe by integrating with their respective APIs on Pipedream.

- **Usage Monitoring and Alerting**: Keep track of how and when your API keys are used by setting up a workflow that logs key usage. Connect to a logging service or database on Pipedream to store this information and set alerts for any unusual activity, such as unexpected spikes in usage or access from unrecognized locations.

- **Provisioning Keys for New Services**: When setting up a new service that requires an API key, automate the process of generating and provisioning the necessary keys. With Pipedream, you can integrate the Neon API with configuration management tools like Ansible or Terraform to streamline the deployment and setup of new services.
