# Overview

The Workboard API enables you to interact with Workboard's platform programmatically, allowing for the automation of tasks related to goal setting, action item tracking, and performance metrics. By deploying workflows on Pipedream, you can connect Workboard to a multitude of other apps, triggering actions and exchanging data to streamline your organization's operations and decision-making processes. A well-integrated system can save time, reduce errors, and provide real-time insights into team performance and project progress.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Meeting Summaries**: After a meeting concludes in your calendar app, a Pipedream workflow can trigger to pull key results and action items from Workboard, format them into a concise summary, and then send the summary via Slack or email to all participants.

- **Project Progress Tracking**: Integrate Workboard with a project management tool like Jira. When updates are made in Jira, a workflow on Pipedream can automatically update the corresponding goals and action items in Workboard, ensuring that all team members have the latest project status.

- **Performance Dashboard Updates**: Use Pipedream to connect Workboard with a data visualization tool like Google Sheets or Tableau. As team members update their goals and metrics in Workboard, the workflow triggers to populate these changes into a dashboard, providing real-time performance updates to stakeholders.
