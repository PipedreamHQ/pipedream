# Overview

The CoderPad API on Pipedream allows developers to streamline technical interviews and coding assessments by automating the creation, management, and evaluation of coding pads. By integrating CoderPad with Pipedream, you can set up custom workflows that respond to events in your hiring pipeline, synchronize interview data with HR systems, evaluate coding performance, and much more. This seamless automation can save time, reduce manual error, and enhance the overall efficiency of technical assessments.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Pad Setup for Interviews**: When a new interview is scheduled in your calendar app (e.g., Google Calendar), Pipedream triggers a workflow that automatically creates a new CoderPad pad, sets it up with the necessary programming language or template, and sends an invite link to the candidate and interviewer.

- **Interview Results Aggregation**: After an interview, the candidate's code submission can be automatically fetched from CoderPad, assessed using a code quality tool (like CodeClimate), and the results can be compiled and pushed to a database or sent via email to the hiring team for review.

- **Real-Time Notifications for Coding Tests**: Set up a workflow that listens for when a candidate starts or completes a coding test in CoderPad. Upon this trigger, real-time notifications can be sent to a Slack channel or via SMS to the hiring team, keeping everyone informed about the candidate's progress.
