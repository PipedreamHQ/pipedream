# Overview

The Agile CRM API interacts with Agile's sales, marketing, and service software, offering a suite of features including contact management, deals, and campaign automation. On Pipedream, you can automate interactions with Agile CRM, such as syncing contacts, updating deals, or triggering campaigns. By leveraging Pipedream's serverless platform, you can connect Agile CRM to hundreds of other apps, creating custom, automated workflows that operate in real-time, and with no server maintenance required.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Shopify Customers to Agile CRM**: Automatically add new customers from a Shopify store as contacts in Agile CRM. Use Pipedream to detect new customer events in Shopify and create corresponding contacts in Agile CRM with details like name, email, and purchase history.

- **Automate Support Ticket Creation from Emails**: When an email is received in a Gmail inbox that matches certain criteria (e.g., subject line contains "Support:"), use Pipedream to parse the email and create a new support ticket in Agile CRM. This can help streamline customer support processes and ensure timely follow-ups.

- **Sync Agile CRM Deals to Google Sheets**: Keep a Google Sheets spreadsheet updated with the latest deals from Agile CRM. Each time a deal is added or updated in Agile CRM, Pipedream can add or modify the corresponding row in Google Sheets, enabling real-time reporting and analysis without manual data entry.
