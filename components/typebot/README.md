# Overview

The Typebot API allows developers to automate interactions and manage data from Typebot, a tool for building conversational forms. Through Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create dynamic and responsive workflows that engage users, collect data efficiently, and trigger actions in other applications based on user responses. Integrating Typebot with Pipedream enables real-time data processing and connectivity with numerous other APIs, services, and data stores, simplifying complex tasks into manageable, automated processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Feedback Collection to Slack**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a Typebot form is submitted that gathers customer feedback. Parse the responses and send a formatted message to a Slack channel to keep your team updated on customer insights in real-time.

- **Event Registration and Google Calendar Integration**: Use Typebot to create an event registration form. When a user registers, trigger a Pipedream workflow that logs the registration details in a Google Sheet and automatically creates an event in Google Calendar, sending an invite to the registrant's email.

- **Lead Generation with CRM Integration**: Setup a Typebot form to capture potential leads. On form submission, trigger a Pipedream workflow that checks the lead's information against a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. If the lead is new, add their details to the CRM and send a personalized follow-up email via SendGrid or another email service provider.
