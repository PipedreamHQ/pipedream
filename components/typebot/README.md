# Overview

Typebot is a conversational form builder that allows you to create interactive and engaging forms for data collection. With Typebot API on Pipedream, you can automate the processing of form submissions, synchronize data with other services, and trigger customized workflows. Utilize the data gathered from Typebot in real-time, enrich it with other services, and streamline processes like lead generation, surveys, and feedback collection.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Lead Qualification and CRM Entry**: When a new form submission from Typebot is detected, Pipedream can evaluate the responses to qualify leads. Based on specified criteria, it can automatically add qualified leads to a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot, ensuring that your sales team focuses on the right prospects.

- **Feedback Analysis and Ticket Creation**: Upon receiving customer feedback via a Typebot form, trigger a Pipedream workflow that performs sentiment analysis using a tool like MonkeyLearn. If negative feedback is detected, create a support ticket in a system like Zendesk or Jira to follow up proactively.

- **Event Registration and Confirmation Emails**: Use Typebot forms for event registration. With Pipedream, when a submission is made, it can confirm the registration by adding the attendee to an event management app like Eventbrite, and send a personalized confirmation email using SendGrid or another email service provider.
