With Rewardful's API, you can create affiliates, track campaigns, and disburse rewards seamlessly.

# Example Use Cases

- **Affiliate Onboarding Automation**: When a new affiliate signs up through a form on your website (managed by an app like Typeform), trigger a Pipedream workflow to automatically add the affiliate to Rewardful, set up their campaign, and send them a welcome email with their unique tracking links using an email platform like SendGrid.

- **Real-time Reward Notifications**: Monitor Rewardful for successful referral conversions and use Pipedream to trigger a message to the corresponding affiliate via Slack, notifying them of their successful referral and the reward they've earned, enhancing motivation and engagement.

- **Monthly Rewardful Analytics Reports**: Schedule a monthly Pipedream workflow that collates all referral data from Rewardful, generates a performance report, and emails it to your marketing team through a service like Mailgun. This workflow could also include a data visualization tool like Google Sheets or Data Studio to create comprehensive analytics dashboards.
