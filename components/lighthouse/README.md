# Overview

The Lighthouse API provides a window into the world of SSL/TLS certificates. It lets you monitor and track certificates issued for specific domains, offering invaluable insights for security and compliance. By leveraging this API within Pipedream, you can automate certificate tracking, set up alerts for new certificates, and integrate this data with other services for a comprehensive view of your domain's security posture.

# Example Use Cases

- **SSL Certificate Change Notifications:** Build a workflow that triggers on a schedule to check for new SSL/TLS certificates issued for your domain using Lighthouse API. If new certificates are detected, automatically send a notification to your team via Slack or email to keep everyone informed of important changes or potential security issues.

- **Compliance Automation:** Create a workflow that uses the Lighthouse API to obtain a list of all certificates for your domain. Connect this to a Google Sheets or Airtable base to log and maintain a history. Use this data to automatically generate compliance reports, ensuring you have a trail of certificate issuance and expiration for audits.

- **Domain Security Dashboard Integration:** Integrate Lighthouse API with a dashboard tool like Grafana or Google Data Studio. Set up a Pipedream workflow that periodically fetches certificate data for your domains and pushes it to your dashboard, providing a real-time visual representation of your SSL/TLS certificate status for monitoring and quick decision-making.
