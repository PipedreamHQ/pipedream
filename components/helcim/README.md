# Overview

Helcim is a payment platform that lets you process transactions, manage customers, and handle various aspects of your business's finances. Using Pipedream, you can tap into the Helcim API to create automations that streamline payment processing, sync transaction data with other business tools, and trigger actions based on payment events. It's an ideal way to integrate sales data with other systems, automate accounting tasks, and enhance customer relationship management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time Payment Notifications**: Create a workflow that listens for new transactions via Helcim. Whenever a payment is processed, use Pipedream to send real-time notifications to your team via Slack or email. This keeps everyone in the loop about sales activity without the need for manual checks.

- **Automated Accounting Integration**: Sync Helcim transactions with accounting software like QuickBooks or Xero. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers each time a new sale is recorded in Helcim, automatically creating a corresponding invoice or updating financial records in your accounting system, saving time and reducing errors.

- **Dynamic Customer Segmentation**: Use Helcim transactions to segment customers based on purchase history. Set up a Pipedream workflow where, after a transaction is completed, customer data is enriched and segmented in a CRM like HubSpot or Salesforce. This allows for targeted marketing campaigns and personalized follow-ups.
