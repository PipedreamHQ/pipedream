# Overview

The Elastic Email API allows you to integrate a robust email sending platform into your Pipedream workflows. Use it to send emails, manage contacts, and track campaign statistics. With this API, you can automate email notifications, synchronize subscriber lists, or trigger marketing campaigns based on user actions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Welcome Email**: Trigger a welcome email through Elastic Email when a new user signs up on your platform, using Pipedream's HTTP / Webhook trigger to start the workflow.

- **Subscriber List Sync**: Maintain a synced subscriber list by updating Elastic Email contacts whenever a user updates their profile in your app, such as a CRM like Salesforce, which can be connected to Pipedream.

- **Transactional Email Trigger**: Send a transactional email, like an order confirmation or password reset, from Elastic Email when an event occurs in an eCommerce platform like Shopify.
