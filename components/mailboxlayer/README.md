# Overview

The Mailboxlayer API provides real-time email validation and verification through simple REST API requests, ensuring the validity and deliverability of an email address. Integrated into Pipedream, this functionality can automate processes like user signup validation, email marketing list cleaning, and instant notification for invalid emails, enhancing the efficiency of communication strategies and maintaining the integrity of email data in various applications.

# Example Use Cases

- **User Signup Verification**: Automatically verify email addresses during the user registration process on your web platform. Use the Mailboxlayer API on Pipedream to validate emails in real-time as users sign up. Connect this with your database (like MySQL or MongoDB) on Pipedream to store the status of each email, ensuring you only capture verified emails in your user database.

- **Email List Cleaning**: Schedule a regular workflow on Pipedream that uses the Mailboxlayer API to validate and clean your email marketing lists. Connect this workflow with marketing platforms like Mailchimp or SendGrid to automatically update your lists, removing invalid emails before sending out campaigns, thus improving deliverability and engagement rates.

- **Real-time Notification for Invalid Emails**: Create a Pipedream workflow that triggers when your system receives a new email address (via webhook from your app). Use the Mailboxlayer API to verify the email and, if itâ€™s invalid, instantly send a notification through Slack or email to your marketing or customer support teams to take immediate action.
