# Overview

The Highrise API offers a programmatic way to interact with your Highrise CRM data, enabling automated workflows that can save time and improve data consistency. With Pipedream, you can build serverless workflows that trigger on new contact additions, updates to existing contacts, or specific actions like emails received or tasks completed in Highrise. Utilizing Pipedream's ability to integrate with a multitude of other services, you can seamlessly connect Highrise to your broader business processes, such as marketing campaigns, support ticketing systems, or project management tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Contact Synchronization Workflow**: When a new contact is added to Highrise, trigger a Pipedream workflow that adds the contact to a Mailchimp list, ensuring your email marketing campaigns are always targeting the most up-to-date list of contacts.

- **Support Ticket Integration**: Use Pipedream to monitor Highrise for new support-related notes or tags on contact records. Once detected, automatically create support tickets in Zendesk with the relevant contact info pulled from Highrise, streamlining the initiation of support cases.

- **Project Management Trigger**: Set up a workflow in Pipedream that watches for completed tasks in Highrise associated with specific deals. When a task is marked as completed, automatically create a follow-up task in Asana or Trello for your project management team to take the next steps in the sales or project pipeline.
