# Overview

The Thanks.io API lets you automate the sending of personalized postcards and letters. This API can be harnessed to craft tailored outreach campaigns, customer appreciation notes, or event-based mailings. By integrating with Pipedream, you can create intelligent, event-driven workflows that trigger mailings based on user activity, data changes, or milestones achieved in other apps, streamlining the way businesses and developers connect with their audiences physically.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Appreciation Workflow**: Automate the sending of thank you postcards to customers after they make a purchase. Trigger a Thanks.io postcard dispatch by connecting Pipedream to an e-commerce platform, like Shopify, capturing new order events.

- **Birthday Club Mailing**: Build a workflow that sends out personalized birthday cards. Use a CRM platform, such as HubSpot, integrated with Pipedream to trigger a Thanks.io mailing each time a contact's birthday is approaching, fostering customer loyalty.

- **Real Estate Follow-Up**: For real estate agents, automate follow-ups with prospects or clients post-viewing. Connect a scheduling app like Calendly to Pipedream, triggering a Thanks.io mailer when a viewing is completed, adding a personal touch to the home buying process.
