# Overview

FinerWorks is an online platform that allows users to print and drop ship fine art prints and other related products. With the FinerWorks API, you can automate the process of creating orders, managing items, and integrating print-on-demand services into your business. When used in Pipedream, it unlocks possibilities for streamlining how orders are processed, integrating with other services like payment gateways or customer relationship management systems, and automating notifications for order updates.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Order Submission**: Automatically submit new orders to FinerWorks when a customer completes a purchase on your e-commerce platform. This workflow could trigger when a new order is placed, extract the necessary details, and use the FinerWorks API to create the order for printing and shipping.

- **Inventory Sync and Update**: Keep your product listings up to date by synchronizing inventory levels between FinerWorks and your online storefront. Whenever an item's stock changes on FinerWorks, the workflow could update your storefront's inventory to reflect the current stock levels.

- **Order Status Notifications**: Set up an automated system to notify customers about the status of their orders. This could involve a workflow that checks the status of orders on FinerWorks at regular intervals and sends an email update to customers using an email service such as SendGrid whenever their order status changes.
