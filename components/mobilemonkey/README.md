# Overview

The MobileMonkey API allows you to automate interactions with your MobileMonkey-powered chatbots. By leveraging this API on Pipedream, you can orchestrate complex workflows that react to events in MobileMonkey, send messages, update contacts, and more, thus enriching your chatbot's capabilities with Pipedream's robust integration platform. You can trigger workflows on Pipedream using webhooks, schedules, or other app events, and incorporate logic to interact with a wide range of services to enhance customer engagement, streamline processes, and gather insights from chatbot interactions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Ticket Creation**: When a user reports an issue via the MobileMonkey chatbot, a Pipedream workflow can be triggered, creating a support ticket in a tool like Zendesk, and then notifying the relevant support team via a Slack message.

- **Lead Qualification and CRM Integration**: A Pipedream workflow can listen for specific keywords or questions in chatbot conversations to qualify leads. Once a lead is qualified, the workflow can automatically add or update the lead's information in a CRM like Salesforce, and then send a personalized follow-up message via MobileMonkey.

- **E-commerce Order Updates**: After a customer places an order through your e-commerce platform, a Pipedream workflow can capture the order details and send a confirmation message through MobileMonkey. It can also monitor the order status and send customers real-time updates on their shipping status directly through the chatbot.
