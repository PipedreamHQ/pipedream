# Overview

The Nasdaq Data Link API provides access to financial, economic, and alternative data that powers investment decisions, research, and more. Within Pipedream, you can use this API to automate workflows involving time series and table data. This might include fetching stock prices, economic indicators, or data for quantitative analysis. By creating workflows that trigger on schedules or events, you can efficiently process and act upon this data. Combine it with other apps to gain insights, notify stakeholders, or integrate with your databases.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Financial Reporting**: Create a workflow that triggers weekly to fetch the latest stock prices and compile a report. This could then be sent via email, Slack, or stored in a Google Sheet for easy access and sharing among team members.

- **Real-time Investment Alerts**: Set up a workflow that checks for specific criteria in the market data, such as sudden drops or spikes in a stock's price. When detected, it can trigger alerts through SMS or messaging apps to inform a rapid investment decision.

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Compile time series data for multiple stocks, then process it within Pipedream to calculate statistical metrics. Push this information to data visualization tools like Tableau or Google Data Studio for real-time dashboard updates.
