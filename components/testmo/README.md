# Overview

The Testmo API enables automation and integration of your testing workflows into the broader CI/CD pipeline. With Pipedream, you can use this API to trigger tests, update test cases, log results, and sync status with other project management tools. By creating custom serverless workflows on Pipedream, you can connect Testmo to various apps, manage test lifecycles, and respond to events from other services in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Trigger Test Runs After Code Commits**: When a new commit is pushed to a repository in GitHub, use a Pipedream workflow to automatically trigger a series of test cases in Testmo. This ensures that new code is tested immediately, keeping your deployment pipeline efficient.

- **Sync Test Results with Project Management Tools**: After tests are completed in Testmo, send the results to a project management tool like Jira or Asana. Use a Pipedream workflow to create or update issues based on the test outcomes, keeping your team in sync with the latest testing status.

- **Aggregate Test Reports for Analytics**: Collect test results from Testmo and send them to a data visualization tool like Google Sheets or Data Studio. With a Pipedream workflow, you can create custom dashboards or reports that provide insights into your testing process and help identify areas for improvement.
