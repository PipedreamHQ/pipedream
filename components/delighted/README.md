# Overview

Delighted API on Pipedream lets you automate and integrate customer feedback into various aspects of your business processes. Utilize real-time survey responses to trigger actions, manage contacts, and streamline follow-ups. With a mix of webhooks and API calls, you can react promptly to customer sentiment, categorize feedback, and enhance customer experience by connecting insights to your CRM, support, and product management tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Auto-tagging feedback for Support Teams**: Automatically tag and sort feedback based on sentiment score into your helpdesk software, such as Zendesk. Use webhook triggers for new feedback in Delighted, apply conditional logic in Pipedream to assess sentiment, and create/update tickets in Zendesk with insights for targeted follow-ups.

- **Feedback-Driven Email Campaigns**: Enrich your email marketing tool, like Mailchimp, with customer feedback to segment and personalize campaigns. When a customer completes a Delighted survey, Pipedream can capture this event, process the feedback, and update Mailchimp subscriber lists to trigger tailored email sequences.

- **Product Feature Request Tracking**: Streamline the process of collecting product feedback by channeling Delighted survey responses into a project management tool like Trello. Set up a Pipedream workflow to filter responses for feature requests and automatically create Trello cards, prioritizing product enhancements based on customer input.
