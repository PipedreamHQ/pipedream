# Overview

The Biztera API allows users to automate their decision-making processes and approval workflows, offering features like requesting approvals, tracking decision status, and integrating with other business tools. Leveraging the Biztera API on Pipedream, you can craft serverless workflows that streamline how approvals are managed within your organization, trigger notifications based on decision changes, and synchronize Biztera data with other systems such as CRMs, project management tools, or custom databases.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Approval Notifications**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that triggers when a new approval request is submitted in Biztera. Use this trigger to send a notification via email, Slack, or SMS to the relevant stakeholders, ensuring that they are promptly informed and can take action quickly.

- **Syncing Decisions with Project Management**: Whenever a decision is made within Biztera, a Pipedream workflow can automatically update the status of a corresponding task or project in a tool like Asana, Trello, or Jira. This keeps project management tightly aligned with internal approvals and ensures that team members are aware of the latest decisions impacting their work.

- **Conditional Approval Escalations**: Construct a Pipedream workflow that monitors decision status in Biztera and applies conditional logic to escalate unaddressed or overdue approvals. If an approval is pending beyond a certain timeframe, the workflow could alert a manager or re-route the request to an alternative approver, helping to prevent bottlenecks in the approval process.
