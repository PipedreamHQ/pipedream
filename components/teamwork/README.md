# Overview

Using the Teamwork API, you can build powerful tools and applications that help
you or your team stay connected and get more done. Here are a few examples of
things you can build with it:

- Automate routine tasks such as adding projects and tasks, moving them through
  progress stages, and assigning users to tasks
- Create custom reports and analytics on project data
- Schedule messaging to be sent out automatically about the progress of
  projects or tasks
- Develop applications that sync with other services such as Gmail and Slack
- Create workflows and custom processes to automate how tasks are handled
- Set up notifications for when deadlines are due or tasks are completed
