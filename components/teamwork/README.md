# Overview

The Teamwork API taps into the power of project management, letting you streamline workflows by automating tasks like creating projects, assigning tasks, tracking time, or updating statuses. With Pipedream, you can effortlessly integrate these capabilities with 3,000+ other apps to create custom automations that fit your team's needs, enhancing productivity and ensuring that your projects are always moving forward with the latest information.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Project Creation from CRMs**: Whenever a new deal is marked as won in your CRM, such as Salesforce or HubSpot, a workflow can trigger the creation of a corresponding project in Teamwork, complete with pre-configured task lists and milestones, ensuring that your team can immediately get started on new client work without manual data entry.

- **Task Management with Real-Time Communication Tools**: Link Teamwork tasks to a Slack channel to notify your team when tasks are created, updated, or completed. This keeps everyone in the loop without having to constantly check for updates in Teamwork and improves collaboration as team members can discuss tasks right in Slack.

- **Time Tracking Analytics and Reporting**: Synchronize time tracking data from Teamwork to a Google Sheets spreadsheet or a business intelligence tool like Tableau. This can empower management with insights into project hours, helping to evaluate performance, estimate better for future projects, and ensure timely completion within budget.
