# Overview

The Infinity API allows you to interact programmatically with Infinity, a flexible project management platform. With the Infinity API on Pipedream, you can automate project and task management, synchronize data across multiple platforms, and streamline workflows by triggering actions within Infinity or responding to events in Infinity. Pipedream's serverless platform enables you to connect Infinity to 3,000+ apps with minimal effort, empowering you to build custom integrations and automations that suit your team's needs.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Infinity Tasks to Google Calendar**: Create events in Google Calendar automatically whenever a new task with a due date is created in Infinity. This ensures that your schedule stays updated with all your project deadlines.

- **Aggregate Feedback from Typeform**: After receiving new form submissions in Typeform, use Pipedream to parse the responses and create corresponding tasks or notes in Infinity. This can be especially useful for gathering customer feedback or managing survey results.

- **Post Slack Notifications on Task Completion**: Set up a workflow that listens for task completion events in Infinity, then sends a notification to a designated Slack channel. This keeps the team informed about project progress without manual updates.
