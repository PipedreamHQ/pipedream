# Overview

The Survey Sparrow API allows you to automate interactions with your surveys, such as creating and sending surveys, retrieving survey responses, and managing contacts. Integrating this API on Pipedream enables the creation of powerful serverless workflows that can react to survey events, analyze responses in real-time, and connect survey data with other apps to enhance data-driven decision-making.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Follow-Up Emails**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream whenever a new survey response is received. Use the respondent's data to send personalized follow-up emails via an email platform like SendGrid or Mailgun, thanking participants or providing further instructions.

- **Survey Data Analysis and Reporting**: Collect survey responses and feed them into a Google Sheets document for further analysis. Set up periodic reports to be generated and sent to your team through platforms like Slack or via email, ensuring everyone is up-to-date with the latest feedback.

- **Contact Management Integration**: Whenever a new contact is added in your CRM, such as Salesforce, use Pipedream to automatically create a new contact in Survey Sparrow. This keeps your survey contacts in sync and ensures that all potential respondents are accounted for in your outreach efforts.
