# Overview

The lobste.rs API provides access to a wealth of information from the lobste.rs community, a computing-focused curated link aggregation site. It offers endpoints to fetch stories, comments, and user details, which can be integrated into various workflows on Pipedream. This integration allows you to monitor new content, track topics or user activity, and even collate data for analysis. With Pipedream, you can seamlessly connect lobste.rs with hundreds of other apps to create tailored automations without managing servers or writing extensive code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Track New Top Stories**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever a new story reaches the top of lobste.rs. Use this to send notifications via email or Slack, ensuring you, your team, or your community stay updated on trending topics in the tech world.

- **Analyze Comment Sentiments**: Whenever a new comment is posted, trigger a workflow that evaluates the comment's sentiment using a service like Google Cloud Natural Language API. Store the sentiment scores in a Google Sheet for ongoing analysis of community engagement and tone.

- **Aggregate User Submissions**: For researchers or community managers, track and accumulate submissions by specific users using Pipedream's built-in cron job feature. Connect your workflow to a database like PostgreSQL to create a historical archive, which you can then query for trends and patterns.
