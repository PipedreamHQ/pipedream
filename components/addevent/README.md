# Overview

The AddEvent API enables automation of calendar event management. With it, you can create events, list upcoming events, and manage RSVPs. Itâ€™s useful for organizations that schedule multiple events and need to streamline their event-creation process, send out invitations, and track attendee responses. On Pipedream, you can build workflows that trigger on various events to connect AddEvent with other apps, creating a seamless event-management experience.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Event Creation from Webhooks**: Automate the creation of calendar events on AddEvent whenever a webhook is received. This is useful for adding events from an external trigger, like a form submission or a ticket purchase.

- **RSVP Tracking with Google Sheets**: Sync AddEvent RSVPs to a Google Sheet to track attendees. This workflow is perfect for event coordinators who need a dynamic attendee list that updates in real-time as RSVPs come in.

- **Event Reminder Emails via SendGrid**: Set up a workflow that sends reminder emails to attendees using SendGrid a day before the event starts. This helps reduce no-shows and keeps your event top-of-mind for participants.
