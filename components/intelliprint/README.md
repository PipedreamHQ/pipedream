# Overview

The Intelliprint API offers a suite of printing solutions, enabling developers to automate the process of sending documents for print. With this API, you can create workflows in Pipedream to programmatically manage print jobs, customize printing options, and track the status of each task. It's ideal for businesses looking to integrate print capabilities into their services without the overhead of managing printers and supplies.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Printing**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow to send invoices for print automatically whenever a new sale is recorded in your e-commerce platform. This can ensure that all paperwork is printed and ready for dispatch without manual intervention.

- **Custom Business Cards on Demand**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for a webhook from a CRM app when new employees are added. The workflow can then use the Intelliprint API to print business cards with the employee's details, streamlining the onboarding process.

- **Print Job Status Tracking**: Construct a Pipedream workflow that periodically checks the status of print jobs submitted through Intelliprint. When a job is complete, the workflow could send a notification via apps like Slack or email, keeping relevant teams informed.
