# Overview

The listmonk API enables you to interact programmatically with the listmonk platform, which specializes in managing mailing lists and sending out newsletters. Using this API, you can automate subscriber management, campaign dispatching, and performance tracking. When you integrate listmonk with Pipedream, you can create powerful workflows that react to events from other apps, process data, and use that data to trigger actions within listmonk.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Subscriber Syncing**: Sync new user registrations from your app (like a Shopify store) with listmonk. Whenever a new user signs up, a Pipedream workflow can capture this event and automatically add the user's details to a specified mailing list in listmonk.

- **Dynamic Campaign Triggers**: React to user behavior from your website tracked by Google Analytics. For instance, when a user visits a specific page or completes an action, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that sends a targeted email campaign through listmonk to that specific user or segment.

- **Survey Response Follow-Ups**: After a user completes a survey via Typeform, Pipedream can process the response and based on certain criteria, like a low satisfaction score, trigger a personalized follow-up email campaign through listmonk to address any concerns or feedback.
