# Overview

The Lahar API enables users to automate and integrate their marketing efforts, facilitating lead management, email campaigns, and analytics. On Pipedream, you can leverage these capabilities to build serverless workflows that respond to events in real-time, sync data across various platforms, and create custom marketing automations without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Syncing with CRM**: Automatically sync new leads captured through Lahar to a CRM platform like Salesforce. Each time a lead is created in Lahar, a Pipedream workflow triggers to insert or update the lead's details in Salesforce, ensuring the sales team has immediate access to new prospects.

- **Email Campaign Trigger from eCommerce Actions**: Connect Lahar with an eCommerce platform like Shopify. Whenever a customer completes a purchase, a Pipedream workflow can trigger an email campaign in Lahar to nurture the customer relationship with personalized follow-ups or product recommendations.

- **Form Submission to Support Ticket**: Integrate Lahar's form submission feature with a customer support tool like Zendesk. Use Pipedream to convert new form submissions into support tickets, automatically categorizing and prioritizing issues based on the form data provided by the user.
