# Overview

The Paddle API on Pipedream allows you to integrate your Paddle account to automate billing, subscription, and user management processes. You can react to events like new purchases or subscription cancellations, sync customer data to other platforms, and even automate financial reporting. This API hooks into Pipedream's capabilities of managing complex workflows with multiple steps, without the need for manual coding or server management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Customer Onboarding**: When a new user purchases a product through Paddle, trigger a Pipedream workflow to send a personalized welcome email through SendGrid and add their contact information to a Mailchimp list for future marketing.

- **Sync Purchase Data to a Database**: Configure a workflow to capture new Paddle transactions and store them in a PostgreSQL database. This can help maintain a record of purchases and assist with financial analysis or inventory management.

- **Handle Subscription Changes**: Set up a listener for subscription update events from Paddle. When a user upgrades, downgrades, or cancels their subscription, use this information to update their permissions in a third-party app like Intercom or Zendesk for customer support tracking.
