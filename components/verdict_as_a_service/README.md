# Overview

Verdict as a Service (VaaS) API provides a powerful interface for automating the analysis of files and URLs for potential threats. Leveraging the capabilities of Pipedream, users can create sophisticated workflows that trigger actions based on the results of the threat analysis. From email attachments to submitted URLs, VaaS can be integrated into a variety of security and data processing pipelines to ensure safety and compliance.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Threat Detection for Email Attachments**: Use Pipedream to monitor an email inbox for new messages. Extract attachments and pass them to the VaaS API for analysis. If a threat is detected, trigger an alert to the security team and move the email to a quarantine folder.

- **Secure File Upload Processing**: Implement a workflow that scans files uploaded to a cloud storage service like Dropbox or Google Drive. Upon file upload, Pipedream sends the file to VaaS for security scanning. If the file is deemed safe, it is then made available to the team; otherwise, the uploader is notified of the issue and the file is removed.

- **URL Analysis for User Submissions**: When users submit URLs through a form or helpdesk ticket, use Pipedream to automate the submission of those URLs to VaaS. Integrate with a CRM or ticketing system like Zendesk to update the ticket with the analysis results, ensuring only safe links are processed by support staff.
