# Overview

The TidyCal API allows for scheduling automation, linking your calendar to create and manage bookings. In Pipedream, you can harness this API to create event-driven workflows, such as syncing with other calendar services, triggering reminders, or connecting with CRM systems to streamline your scheduling process. Pipedream's serverless platform enables you to build and run these workflows efficiently, without the need to manage infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync TidyCal with Google Calendar**: When a new booking is made via TidyCal, automatically create an event in Google Calendar. Use this to keep all your appointments in sync across different calendar services.

- **Send Custom Email Reminders**: Set up a workflow that sends personalized email reminders to your clients via SendGrid, Mailgun, or Gmail before their appointment. Include details like date, time, and preparation instructions.

- **Integrate with CRM Systems**: Upon a new TidyCal booking, add or update the client's details in a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. This can help in maintaining updated customer information and streamline follow-ups.
