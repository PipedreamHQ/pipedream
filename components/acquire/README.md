# Overview

The Acquire API integrates customer support tools into your apps, enabling live chat, voice and video calls, co-browsing, and AI chatbots. With Pipedream, you can automate customer interaction workflows, sync support tickets with other platforms, or trigger actions based on customer behavior. Pipedream's serverless platform allows you to connect Acquire with hundreds of other apps for seamless automation, all with minimal coding.

# Example Use Cases

- **Support Ticket Routing**: Automatically route new support tickets created in Acquire to a designated Slack channel. This keeps your support team immediately informed and helps ensure that no customer queries fall through the cracks.

- **Customer Feedback Aggregation**: Collect feedback submitted through Acquire and send it to a Google Sheet for analysis. This workflow could trigger follow-up actions, like sending a thank you email from Gmail or a discount code for their next purchase, based on the feedback.

- **Real-Time Alerts for High-Value Customers**: Set up a workflow that triggers when a high-value customer starts a chat on Acquire. Automatically send a notification to a VIP support agent via Microsoft Teams, along with the customer's purchase history from Salesforce, to provide personalized and immediate service.
