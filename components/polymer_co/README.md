# Overview

Polymer.co specializes in data governance and privacy, providing tools that enable businesses to manage and secure sensitive data effectively. With Polymer.co's API, you can programmatically control access to data, monitor data usage, and enforce data privacy policies. This API is essential for organizations looking to automate their data protection processes and ensure compliance with various privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Masking for Compliance**: Set up a workflow that monitors incoming data streams and automatically applies masking or redaction to personally identifiable information (PII) before it is stored in your databases. This helps in maintaining compliance with data protection regulations without manual intervention.

- **Real-Time Privacy Alerts**: Create a workflow where Polymer.co detects unauthorized access or anomalistic data usage patterns. Once detected, it triggers an alert system (like sending notifications through Slack or email) to inform the security team, enabling swift action to mitigate potential breaches.

- **Enhanced Data Access Governance**: Implement a system where access requests for sensitive data are automatically processed and logged. Each request can trigger a workflow that checks against predefined access policies in Polymer.co, and if approved, grants access while logging the details for audit purposes. This streamlines secure data access management and keeps a clear record for compliance audits.
