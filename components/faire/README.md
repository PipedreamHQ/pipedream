# Overview

The Faire API provides a gateway to automate retail operations, syncing products, orders, and inventory between Faire's marketplace and various business systems. Using Pipedream, you can connect Faire to a multitude of other services, crafting workflows that streamline retail processes, update inventory in real-time, and respond swiftly to new orders or customer inquiries.

# Example Use Cases

- **Order Fulfillment Automation**: When a new order is placed on Faire, trigger a Pipedream workflow that creates an order in your fulfillment system, like ShipStation or Shopify. Automatically send tracking information back to Faire when the order is shipped.

- **Inventory Sync**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that regularly checks inventory levels in your database or ERP system. If the stock changes, it updates the inventory on Faire to keep product availability current, preventing overselling.

- **Customer Support Ticket Creation**: Whenever a return request or a customer question comes through Faire, use Pipedream to create a ticket in your customer support platform, such as Zendesk, and assign it to the appropriate team, ensuring a quick response to customer needs.
