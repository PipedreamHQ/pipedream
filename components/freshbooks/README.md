# Overview

The FreshBooks API lets you automate invoicing, expense tracking, timekeeping and client management tasks. By harnessing this API within Pipedream, you can create custom automations that sync your financial data with other business applications, respond to client actions quickly, and streamline payment processes. The API enables you to pull reports, manage invoices, and update client information, making it a powerful tool for freelancers and small businesses looking to automate their accounting tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Invoice Automation Workflow**: When a new sale is recorded in your e-commerce platform (like Shopify), trigger a Pipedream workflow that creates a corresponding invoice in FreshBooks. This workflow can be set to collect necessary details such as customer information, items purchased, and prices, then pushes this data to FreshBooks to generate an invoice automatically.

- **Expense Tracking Integration**: Connect FreshBooks to a receipt scanning app (like Expensify) using Pipedream. Each time a new receipt is scanned and categorized in the scanning app, the workflow triggers, creating or updating an expense entry in FreshBooks. This keeps your expense tracking up-to-date without manual data entry.

- **Time Tracking and Billing Sync**: Integrate FreshBooks with a time tracking tool such as Toggl. Each time a time entry is logged in Toggl, a Pipedream workflow runs, pulling the time entry data and creating or updating an invoice in FreshBooks for the corresponding project or client, ensuring that billing is accurate and up-to-date.
