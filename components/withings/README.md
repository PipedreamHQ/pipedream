# Overview

The Withings API allows developers to access and leverage Withings health data
to create innovative and valuable applications. With the Withings API, users
are able to build applications that give them access to data from Withings’
connected health devices such as activity trackers, digital scales, and blood
pressure and thermometer devices.

With the Withings API, it is possible to build applications that help users
connect to their data and use it effectively and efficiently. Here are a few
examples of what can be achieved with the Withings API:

- Activity tracker applications to help users visualize and understand their
  health data, such as fitness and sleep tracking apps.
- Digital scales applications that can collect a user’s body weight data over
  time and show trends.
- Blood pressure monitor applications to measure the user’s blood pressure and
  store heart rate data.
- Thermometer applications to show trends in body temperature.
- Analytical and dashboard applications that allow users to generate reports,
  set goals, and access data from multiple sources.
- Visualization and notification apps that allow users to set up customized
  notifications and alarms.
- Automation apps that allow users to set up automated actions based on their
  health data.

By leveraging the Withings API, developers are able to unlock valuable,
actionable data to create innovative and useful applications that can improve
users’ lives.
