# Overview

The Automatic Data Extraction API by Zyte specializes in extracting structured data from web pages. When incorporated into Pipedream workflows, this API allows you to automate the process of gathering web data, which can feed into various tasks such as market research, price monitoring, or even lead generation. By triggering workflows with new data inputs, processing and storing the extracted data, and connecting to other apps, Pipedream amplifies the API's utility.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Change Detection and Alerting**: Use the Automatic Data Extraction API to monitor changes in content on target websites. When a change is detected, like a price drop or a new article publication, trigger a Pipedream workflow to send an alert via email (using the SendGrid app) or post a notification in a Slack channel.

- **Competitor Price Tracking**: Set up a scheduled Pipedream workflow to extract pricing data from competitor websites daily. Process and compare this data within Pipedream, then update a Google Sheets document with the latest pricing information for easy analysis and decision-making.

- **Lead Generation from Online Directories**: Utilize the API to pull contact information from online business directories. With Pipedream, parse the extracted data for quality leads and enrich it using a CRM app like Salesforce. Automatically create new leads in Salesforce with the enriched data for your sales team to act upon.
