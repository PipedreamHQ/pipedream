# Overview

The Knorish API provides a gateway to manage and automate tasks for online course platforms. With it, you can streamline processes like user enrollment, course content management, and tracking learner progress. When leveraged through Pipedream, Knorish API enables the creation of custom, serverless workflows that can connect with other apps to enrich e-learning experiences, perform administrative tasks, or analyze educational activities.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate User Enrollment and Welcome Emails**: When a new user signs up for a course on Knorish, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that automatically enrolls the user in the course and sends a personalized welcome email using the SendGrid app, ensuring a smooth onboarding process.

- **Synchronize Course Updates with a CMS**: Whenever a course is updated on Knorish, Pipedream can detect the change and synchronize the updated content with a Content Management System (CMS) like WordPress. This keeps your course listings current across platforms without manual intervention.

- **Generate Certificates and Update CRM**: On course completion, Pipedream can call Knorish API to issue a certificate and then update a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system like Salesforce with the user's completion status, enabling better tracking of learner achievements and targeted follow-up marketing.
