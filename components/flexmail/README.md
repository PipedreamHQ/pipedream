# Overview

Flexmail API offers a way to automate your email marketing campaigns by allowing you to manage contacts, send out emails, and track results. With Pipedream's ability to integrate with hundreds of services, you can set up complex workflows that respond to events from various apps by updating contact lists, sending personalized content, or triggering sequences of marketing actions based on user behavior or data changes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Email Campaigns Based on E-Commerce Activity**: When a new order is placed in Shopify, use Pipedream to add that customer to a specific segment in Flexmail and trigger an automated email sequence, such as a thank you message, product recommendations, or a request for review.

- **Sync New Subscribers Across Platforms**: Upon a new subscriber being added to a Wordpress site, Pipedream can capture that event and automatically add the subscriber to a Flexmail mailing list, ensuring your marketing efforts are consistent across all platforms.

- **Dynamic Email Content Based on User Behavior**: If a user watches a webinar hosted on Zoom, Pipedream could trigger a workflow that sends a follow-up email via Flexmail with additional resources or calls to action personalized to the content of the webinar they attended.
