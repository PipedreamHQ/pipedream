# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contact Syncing**: Sync new subscribers from a Google Sheets spreadsheet to your GiantCampaign contact list. Every time a row is added to the spreadsheet, Pipedream triggers a workflow that automatically adds the contact to a specified list in GiantCampaign.

- **Dynamic Campaign Triggering**: Trigger an email campaign in GiantCampaign based on customer activity from your e-commerce platform, like Shopify. When a customer completes a purchase, Pipedream can automatically send a follow-up campaign from GiantCampaign, perhaps offering a discount on future purchases or asking for feedback.

- **Performance-Driven Reactivation**: Re-engage inactive subscribers by connecting GiantCampaign with a CRM like HubSpot. Pipedream can monitor engagement metrics from your email campaigns and tag inactive users in your CRM, triggering a reactivation workflow in GiantCampaign tailored to win back their attention.
