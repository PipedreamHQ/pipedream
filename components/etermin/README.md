# Overview

The eTermin API empowers users to automate scheduling and calendar management tasks. With it, you can sync appointments, manage bookings, and update event details seamlessly. Pipedream's capabilities allow you to integrate these features into a multitude of workflows, connecting eTermin's API with other services to create powerful automation that can save time and reduce manual effort. From synchronizing appointments with Google Calendar to sending SMS reminders via Twilio, the possibilities stretch as far as your creativity.

# Example Use Cases

- **Appointment Synchronization with Google Calendar**: Sync new eTermin appointments to a Google Calendar, ensuring all your events are up to date across platforms. When a new appointment is created in eTermin, a Pipedream workflow can automatically add that appointment to a specified Google Calendar, with details like time, date, and participant information.

- **Customer Follow-Up with Email**: After an appointment is completed, trigger a workflow to send a follow-up email via SendGrid. This could include a personalized thank you, a request for feedback, or an invitation to book another appointment. The workflow would listen for a 'completed appointment' event from eTermin and use customer details to craft and send a tailored email.

- **SMS Appointment Reminders**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to send SMS reminders to clients a day before their scheduled appointment. Using the eTermin API to fetch upcoming appointments and Twilio to send out SMS messages, this automation ensures clients are reminded of their appointments, which can help reduce no-shows and improve customer satisfaction.
