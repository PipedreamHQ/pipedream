# Overview

The CodeScene API lets you dive into the technical and social aspects of your codebase. It offers insights into code health, identifies hotspots, and provides actionable information for technical debt management. Integrating CodeScene with Pipedream allows you to automate these insights, tying them into your workflow to ensure code quality and team efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Code Health Reports**: Schedule a Pipedream workflow to fetch code health metrics from CodeScene on a regular basis, then send a formatted report to your team's Slack channel or email, keeping everyone updated on potential problem areas.

- **Pull Request Analysis Trigger**: Set up a workflow where each new pull request on GitHub triggers an analysis in CodeScene. The results can then be posted back as a comment on the PR, ensuring that code reviews are informed by CodeScene's findings before a merge.

- **Project Health Dashboard Update**: Use Pipedream to pull project health data from CodeScene at regular intervals and update a project management tool like Jira or Trello with the latest metrics, providing a live dashboard of codebase health for project managers.
