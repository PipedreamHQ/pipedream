# Overview

The Brex API offers a powerful avenue for automating financial operations, providing programmatic access to a company's Brex account. Through the API, you can manage cards, view transactions, and handle rewards programmatically. When combined with Pipedream, the API's capabilities expand, allowing users to integrate Brex data with other apps, trigger workflows based on financial events, and streamline financial reporting and reconciliation processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Expense Management Automation**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever a new transaction is posted to a Brex account. Automatically categorize the transaction, send a Slack message to the relevant department head for review, and update a Google Sheet used for expense tracking.

- **Receipt Collection Workflow**: Send an email or a Slack prompt to employees using a Pipedream workflow when a new Brex card transaction lacks a receipt. This can be set up to run periodically and check for transactions that are missing documentation, ensuring compliance with company expense policies.

- **Real-Time Financial Dashboard**: Use Pipedream to feed Brex transaction data into a BI tool like Tableau or Looker. Set up a webhook that triggers a workflow on each new transaction, which then processes the data and sends it to the BI tool, providing up-to-date financial insights.
