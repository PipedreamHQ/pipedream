# Overview

Power Automate, part of Microsoft's Power Platform, allows users to create automated workflows between applications and services to synchronize files, get notifications, collect data, and more. With its API, you can trigger these workflows directly from Pipedream, manipulate data, and react to events from hundreds of apps. By integrating Power Automate API on Pipedream, you can manage flows, invoke actions, and automate tasks across diverse services, enhancing productivity and operational efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Entry and CRM Updates**: Automatically sync new entries from a Google Sheet and update corresponding records in a CRM like Salesforce. When a new row is added in Google Sheets, trigger a Power Automate flow via Pipedream to process and send data to Salesforce, ensuring CRM data is always up-to-date without manual intervention.

- **Real-time Notifications for IT Support**: Set up a workflow that triggers a Power Automate flow when a new high-priority ticket is created in Zendesk. The flow can then send a message with ticket details to a Slack channel dedicated to IT support, speeding up response times and improving service delivery.

- **Automated Document Management and Approval**: When a new document is uploaded to a SharePoint site, use Power Automate to start a document approval process. Once approved, Pipedream can automate the process of moving the document to secure storage like Google Drive and notify relevant team members through email or a team messaging app like Microsoft Teams.
