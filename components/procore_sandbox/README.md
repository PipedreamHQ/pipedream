# Overview

The Procore Sandbox API provides a simulated environment for developers to safely test and develop applications and integrations without affecting live data. This API mirrors the functionality of the Procore production environment, making it a fantastic tool for trial and error, development, and pre-deployment testing. Using the Pipedream platform, developers can create automated workflows that connect the Procore Sandbox API with hundreds of other apps, enabling streamlined construction management processes, improved data accuracy, and enhanced team collaboration.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Project Setup**: When a new project is added in your CRM system (like Salesforce), trigger a workflow in Pipedream to automatically create a corresponding project in Procore Sandbox. This can include setting up project details, budgets, and schedules directly from the CRM data.

- **Change Order Management**: Connect Procore Sandbox to an email platform like Gmail. Whenever a new change order is initiated in Procore Sandbox, automatically send detailed emails to relevant stakeholders. This workflow can include extracting change order details from Procore and formatting these into a readable email template.

- **Safety Compliance Tracking**: Automate compliance tracking by integrating Procore Sandbox with a document management system like Google Drive. When new safety documents or compliance forms are uploaded to a specific Google Drive folder, a workflow can trigger their import into the corresponding Procore Sandbox project, ensuring that safety records are up-to-date and centrally stored.
