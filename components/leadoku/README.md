# Overview

Leadoku API provides functionality for managing and automating tasks related to lead generation, verification, and enrichment. By integrating this API into Pipedream workflows, users can automate the capture, validation, and synchronization of lead data across various platforms, improving efficiency and accuracy in lead management processes. This can particularly benefit sales and marketing teams by ensuring that they work with high-quality, actionable leads.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Capture and Email Verification**: Automatically capture leads from a web form using HTTP triggers on Pipedream and pass them to the Leadoku API to verify email addresses. Once verified, the leads can be added to a CRM like Salesforce, ensuring that only valid and actionable contacts are saved.

- **Lead Enrichment and Sync to Marketing Platforms**: When a new lead is captured via social media or direct marketing campaigns, use Leadoku to enrich the lead's information by adding data like company, role, and industry. Subsequently, sync this enriched data to marketing platforms like Mailchimp for segmented and targeted marketing campaigns.

- **Real-time Lead Scoring and Notification**: Implement a workflow where Leadoku scores leads based on predefined criteria such as engagement level, demography, and past interactions. Use conditional logic in Pipedream to evaluate these scores and trigger real-time notifications to sales teams via Slack or email, enabling them to prioritize and act on hot leads swiftly.
