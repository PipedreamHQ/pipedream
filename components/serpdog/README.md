# Overview

The Serpdog API lets you track search engine rankings for keywords across different regions and devices. Using this API on Pipedream, you can automate SEO monitoring tasks, integrate ranking data into reports, or trigger actions based on ranking changes. Pipedream's serverless platform facilitates the creation of workflows using Serpdog's data, without the need for a dedicated server or complex infrastructure setup.

# Example Use Cases

- **Daily SEO Report Generation**: Build a Pipedream workflow that triggers daily, fetching current rankings for your tracked keywords from Serpdog. Combine this data with other metrics from Google Analytics using the Google Analytics API, and send a comprehensive SEO performance report to Slack or via email.

- **Alerts for Ranking Changes**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that checks Serpdog for keyword ranking changes at regular intervals. If significant changes are detected, such as a drop out of the top 10 results, trigger a notification to a specified Discord channel using the Discord Webhook app on Pipedream to quickly inform your SEO team.

- **Sync Ranking Data with a Database**: Create a Pipedream workflow that periodically calls the Serpdog API to retrieve the latest ranking information. Store this data in a PostgreSQL database by connecting to the PostgreSQL app on Pipedream. Use this historical data to analyze trends and make informed decisions about your SEO strategy.
