# Overview

The Tableau API allows you to tap into the robust data visualization and business intelligence capabilities of Tableau. Within Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate reporting, manage users, update data sources, and extract insights. This enables you to integrate Tableau's analytics with other services, streamlining your data workflows and ensuring your dashboards remain up-to-date with minimal manual effort.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Snapshot Sharing**: Generate snapshots of your key Tableau dashboards and share them via email or Slack at regular intervals. This keeps your team informed with the latest business insights without manual exports.

  _Example Workflow_: Trigger a Pipedream workflow on a schedule; use Tableau API to capture a view of the dashboard; send the image via Gmail or post to a Slack channel using their respective Pipedream app integrations.

- **Dynamic Data Updates**: Automatically update Tableau data sources when new data comes into your backend systems, ensuring that Tableau dashboards reflect the most current data.

  _Example Workflow_: Trigger a Pipedream workflow with a webhook when new data is added to a database; process and format the data within the workflow; use Tableau API to refresh the corresponding data source on Tableau Server or Tableau Online.

- **User Management Automation**: Streamline user provisioning by automating the addition and removal of users to and from Tableau sites based on HR software triggers or internal databases.

  _Example Workflow_: Trigger a Pipedream workflow from a user management event in an app like BambooHR; use conditions within the workflow to determine if the user should be added or removed; utilize Tableau API to update the user list on the relevant Tableau site.
