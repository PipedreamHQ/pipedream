# Overview

Daily API offers a suite of powerful video and audio capabilities, enabling the creation, management, and customization of real-time video and audio calls directly within your applications. Pipedream, as a serverless integration and automation platform, empowers users to connect Daily with various other apps to automate workflows. Whether you're looking to synchronize meeting data with project management tools, kick off post-meeting workflows, or manage recordings at scale, Pipedream provides the infrastructure to streamline these processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Meeting Summaries:** After a Daily call ends, trigger a workflow on Pipedream that captures call metadata, transcribes audio recordings, and sends a summary email to all participants using the Gmail app.

- **Meeting Scheduler with Calendar Integration:** Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for new events in a Google Calendar, automatically creates corresponding Daily meeting rooms, and then emails the meeting links to attendees using the Gmail app.

- **Post-Call Feedback Collection:** Initiate a Pipedream workflow once a Daily meeting concludes to send a feedback form via Typeform to all participants, then collect and store responses in a Google Sheet for analysis.
