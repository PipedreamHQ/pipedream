# Overview

The Klazify API offers a way to classify websites into categories, discover company logo URLs, and access social media links from a domain. When integrated into Pipedream, this functionality can expand, allowing you to automate workflows for marketing analysis, content filtering, or business intelligence. You can trigger actions based on website categories, enrich CRM data with company logos, or compile lists of social media profiles for outreach.

# Example Use Cases

- **Website Categorization for Content Moderation**: Use Klazify to categorize websites submitted by users in a community platform. Trigger a Pipedream workflow when a new URL is submitted, classify it with Klazify, and automatically flag content for review if it falls into sensitive categories.

- **Enriching CRM Data with Company Logos**: Connect Klazify with a CRM app like Salesforce on Pipedream. When a new company is added to your CRM, use Klazify to fetch the company's logo and social media links, then update the CRM record with this enriched data.

- **Automated Social Media Profile Collection**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that uses Klazify to gather social media profiles related to a list of domains. This can be useful for marketing campaigns, competitor analysis, or lead generation, by automatically creating a database of social media profiles for outreach or monitoring.
