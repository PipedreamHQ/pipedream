# Overview

The Browse AI API enables the automation of data extraction from websites, turning web pages into organized data. It's built for non-coders and coders alike, allowing for custom web scraping and monitoring tasks. Within Pipedream, you can harness Browse AI to create intricate workflows that trigger actions in other apps based on the data you extract. Think of automated competitive analysis, price tracking, or content changes detection, all streamlined through Pipedream's serverless platform.

# Example Use Cases

- **Track Competitor Price Changes**: Set up a Browse AI task to monitor a competitor's product pricing page. When a price change is detected, trigger a Pipedream workflow that updates a shared Google Sheet and sends a Slack notification to your sales team.

- **Monitor Website Content Changes**: Employ Browse AI to watch for content updates on industry news sites. Combine it with Pipedream to parse the extracted data and send summaries via Gmail to your marketing team for content strategy alignment.

- **Alert for Restocked Products**: Create a Browse AI task to check for stock updates on e-commerce sites. Use Pipedream to link this data with Twilio, sending an SMS alert to interested customers when their desired product is back in stock.
