# Overview

The Leadpops API provides a toolkit for optimizing lead conversion for real estate and mortgage professionals. By integrating Leadpops with Pipedream, users can automate lead capture processes, streamline follow-up communications, and synchronize lead information across various marketing and CRM platforms. Pipedream’s serverless execution model and easy-to-use interface allow for building complex workflows to act upon data received from Leadpops without delving deep into coding.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Lead Synchronization with CRM**: Capture leads using Leadpops funnels and automatically add them to a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. When a new lead is captured, a workflow can trigger that creates or updates the lead’s record in the CRM, ensuring that follow-up actions are timely and no leads fall through the cracks.

- **Lead Qualification and Notification Workflow**: Create a workflow that qualifies leads based on custom criteria set in Leadpops. Once a lead meets the qualification standards, use Pipedream to send real-time notifications via email, SMS, or messaging apps like Slack to the appropriate salesperson or team, enabling immediate engagement.

- **Dynamic Retargeting Campaigns**: Leverage the data from Leadpops to build dynamic retargeting campaigns on platforms like Facebook Ads or Google Ads. When a lead interacts with a Leadpops funnel, a Pipedream workflow can be triggered to add the lead to a custom audience for more personalized and effective advertising efforts.
