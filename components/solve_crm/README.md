# Overview

The Solve CRM API offers a variety of endpoints to manage customer relationships and sales processes programmatically. It enables users to create, read, update, and delete customer data, manage projects, track email communication, and automate workflows involving contacts and companies. Pipedream harnesses this power, allowing you to connect Solve CRM with a myriad of other apps and services to streamline sales pipelines, enhance customer engagement, and automate routine tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Enrichment and Follow-Up**: Automate the process of enriching new leads with additional data from external sources (like Clearbit) as soon as they are added to Solve CRM. Then, trigger an email sequence from a platform like SendGrid to engage these leads immediately.

- **Support Ticket Creation from Email**: Monitor a dedicated support email inbox with an Email Trigger in Pipedream. Parse received emails for issues and automatically create corresponding support tickets in Solve CRM, assigning them to the appropriate team or individual.

- **Project Management Sync**: When a new project is created in Solve CRM, trigger a workflow that creates a matching project in a project management app like Trello or Asana, syncing all necessary data. This keeps teams aligned across platforms and ensures seamless project tracking.
