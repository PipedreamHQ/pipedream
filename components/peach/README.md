# Overview

The Peach API allows developers to build engaging social features by managing profiles, friendships, feeds, and notifications in web and mobile applications. With the API, you can enhance user engagement by integrating social components like user interactions and real-time updates directly into your platforms. Using Pipedream, you can automate interactions with the Peach API, orchestrate data flow between Peach and other services, and trigger actions based on user behavior or scheduled times.

# Example Use Cases

- **User Activity Notifications**: Automatically send notifications through email or SMS when a user's post receives significant interaction on your platform. For instance, integrate Peach with SendGrid or Twilio on Pipedream to notify users when their posts hit certain milestones of likes or comments.

- **Automated Content Moderation**: Set up a workflow where content flagged by users on Peach triggers a moderation task. Connect Peach to a natural language processing service like Google Cloud Natural Language API through Pipedream to analyze and moderate content for inappropriate material automatically.

- **Dynamic Feed Updates**: Implement a real-time feed update system where user actions on Peach trigger updates in other parts of your app. Use Pipedream to connect Peach API with WebSocket endpoints or update a real-time dashboard on Google Sheets with new post interactions or friend activities.
