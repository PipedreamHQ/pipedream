# Overview

The Document360 API enables programmatic interaction with your knowledge base, allowing you to automate content creation, updates, and management. With this API, you can integrate Document360 into your existing content pipelines, support workflows, or any system that needs to push or pull knowledge base content. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to craft serverless workflows that seamlessly integrate with other apps to keep documentation up-to-date, trigger notifications based on content changes, or analyze knowledge base usage.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Knowledge Base Article Updates**: Keep your documentation fresh by automating the update process. When a relevant ticket is resolved in a connected system, such as Zendesk or Jira, use a Pipedream workflow to update related articles in Document360 with the latest information.

- **Content Publishing from Git Pushes**: Automatically pull the latest documentation from your Git repository and publish to Document360 whenever a new push to the repo is made. This ensures that your knowledge base reflects the most recent changes without manual intervention.

- **Knowledge Base Analytics Reporting**: Channel knowledge base analytics into a data visualization tool like Google Data Studio. A Pipedream workflow can trigger on a schedule to fetch analytics from Document360 and send them to Data Studio, offering regular insights into how your content is performing.
