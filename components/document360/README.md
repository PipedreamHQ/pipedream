# Overview

Document360 is an API that allows you to interact programmatically with your knowledge base. It provides functionality to manage and retrieve articles, categories, and settings within your Document360 project. This can be highly beneficial for automating content updates, syncing data across platforms, or dynamically adjusting your knowledge management practices based on user interactions or feedback.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Updates**: Automatically update articles in Document360 whenever a related document or file is updated in your Google Drive. This ensures that your knowledge base always contains the most current information without manual intervention.

- **User Feedback Integration**: Collect user feedback on articles via a web form or support ticket system like Zendesk. Use this feedback to automatically create tasks in a project management tool like Trello or Asana to revise or improve articles, ensuring that content remains relevant and useful.

- **Dynamic Knowledge Base Management**: Monitor activity in tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams, and based on specific triggers (like a frequently asked question), automatically create or update articles in Document360. This helps in keeping the knowledge base up-to-date with real-time information and questions being raised by users.
