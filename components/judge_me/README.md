# Overview

The Judge.me API lets you tap into a rich repository of product review data, enabling you to automate the gathering, moderation, and publication of reviews on your store. You can also trigger actions based on review events, like thanking a customer after they leave a positive review or addressing negative feedback promptly. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can craft workflows to interact with other apps, streamline processes, and react to review-related activities in real-time, without writing any backend code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Reviews to a Google Sheet**: Automatically push new reviews from Judge.me into a Google Sheet for easy monitoring and analysis. This workflow can help with aggregating data for reporting purposes or sharing with your team.

- **Send Review Thank-You Emails**: Trigger an automated thank-you email to customers who've left a review, using an email service like SendGrid. Personalize the message based on the review content and rating, enhancing customer relationships.

- **Create Support Tickets from Negative Reviews**: Whenever a review below a certain rating threshold is received, create a support ticket in a tool like Zendesk. This allows your support team to follow up quickly and address any concerns raised by the customer.
