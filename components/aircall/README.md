# Overview

The Aircall API allows you to harness telephony features within your applications, enabling you to manage calls, contacts, users, and more programmatically. With Pipedream's capability to leverage this API, you can automate call logging, synchronize contact information across platforms, dynamically route calls based on business logic, and generate analytics and reports.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Call Logging to CRM**: After a call ends on Aircall, trigger a workflow on Pipedream that captures call details and logs them into a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. This ensures that all interaction history is up-to-date and easily accessible for sales and support teams.

- **Contact Synchronization Workflow**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for new contacts or updates in Aircall and automatically syncs them to other apps such as Google Contacts or Mailchimp. This keeps all contact lists in sync without manual data entry, reducing errors and saving time.

- **Dynamic Call Routing Based on Support Tickets**: Create a Pipedream workflow that checks incoming calls against open support tickets in a service like Zendesk. Depending on the priority or status of the ticket, the call can be routed to the appropriate support agent or department, improving response times and customer satisfaction.
