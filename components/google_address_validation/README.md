# Overview

The Google Address Validation API helps ensure that address data entered is accurate, complete, and standardized. By integrating this API with Pipedream, you can automate workflows that depend on reliable address information. This can range from enhancing data quality in customer databases to streamlining delivery processes in e-commerce operations. Pipedream's capabilities enable you to trigger workflows based on the validated addresses, connect with multiple other apps, and automate actions based on address validation results.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Data Cleanup in CRM Systems**: Automatically validate and correct addresses as they are entered into a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. This ensures that all customer information stored is accurate, reducing delivery errors and improving customer service interactions.

- **E-commerce Order Processing**: Use the Google Address Validation API to verify addresses on orders in real-time during the checkout process on platforms like Shopify or WooCommerce. Correct addresses can automatically trigger further actions in the workflow, such as calculating shipping costs, tax rates, or sending the order to the fulfillment service.

- **Automated Mailing List Verification**: Before sending out marketing materials or newsletters via platforms like SendGrid or Mailchimp, validate the mailing addresses in your subscriber list to enhance deliverability and reduce wastage caused by sending to incorrect or non-existent addresses.
