# Overview

The Easyship API unlocks the potential for seamless shipping processes, by integrating a multitude of courier services into your workflow. With this API, you can automate the retrieval of shipping rates, create shipments, manage orders, and track packages in transit. This streamlines the logistics side of e-commerce, ensuring that businesses can focus on what they do best – sell products – while the shipping details are handled efficiently in the background.

# Example Use Cases

**Automated Order Fulfillment**

- When a new order is placed in your e-commerce platform, such as Shopify, trigger a Pipedream workflow to automatically create a shipment with Easyship. The workflow could then retrieve the best shipping rates, select a preferred courier, and generate shipping labels, all without manual intervention.

**Real-time Shipping Updates**

- Set up a workflow that listens for webhook events from Easyship for tracking updates. Whenever there's a change in the shipment status, the workflow can push these updates to a Slack channel, an email, or an SMS service like Twilio, keeping customers informed every step of the way.

**Centralized Shipping Dashboard**

- Build a workflow that periodically pulls all your shipment data from Easyship and pushes it into a Google Sheets document or a dashboard application like Grafana. This enables you to have a centralized view of all shipping metrics and manage operations more effectively.
