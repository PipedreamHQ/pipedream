# Overview

SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a secure file transfer protocol for
exchanging files between computers over a secure connection. The protocol
utilizes public-key cryptography to provide authentication and encryption of
the data being transferred. SFTP is widely used in enterprise environments for
securely transferring data between locations and users, as well as for managing
remote computer systems (for example, for monitoring and software/security
updates).

Here are some examples of what you can build using the SFTP (key-based auth)
API:

- Secure file backup and restore solutions.
- Text editors that can securely open, modify and save remote files.
- Manage remote uploads, downloads, editing, navigation, etc.
- Automate remote system management tasks (e.g., installation of applications,
  software/security updates).
- Share and sync files between multiple systems.
- Remote user authentication.
- Custom solutions tailored to specific needs.
