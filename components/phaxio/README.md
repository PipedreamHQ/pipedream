# Overview

The Phaxio API turns the cumbersome fax communication into a streamlined digital process. By leveraging Phaxio with Pipedream, you can automate sending and receiving faxes, manage fax statuses, and integrate fax capabilities into your existing digital workflows without dealing with traditional fax machines. This can be particularly useful for industries like healthcare, legal, or finance where faxing documents is still prevalent.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Submission**: Use Phaxio to fax invoices to clients automatically whenever a new sale is recorded in your e-commerce platform. Trigger a Pipedream workflow with a new order event, then send the invoice as a fax via Phaxio.

- **Fax to Email Bridge**: Set up a Phaxio-Pipedream workflow to receive faxes and forward them as email attachments. This can streamline document intake for businesses that receive orders or documents via fax.

- **Multi-step Approval Process**: Integrate Phaxio into an approval workflow where a document is faxed out, and then, upon receiving a confirmation, triggers follow-up tasks such as updating a CRM or notifying team members via apps like Slack.
