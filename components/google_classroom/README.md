# Overview

With the Google Classroom API, you can manage your Google Classroom classes and
coursework. You can also use the API to create and manage announcements,
assignments, and student submissions.

Here are some example applications you could build with the Google Classroom
API:

- A course management system that allows teachers to create and manage their
  courses online
- An announcement system that allows teachers to post announcements to their
  classes
- An assignment management system that allows teachers to create and manage
  assignments for their classes
- A student submission system that allows teachers to view and grade student
  submissions
