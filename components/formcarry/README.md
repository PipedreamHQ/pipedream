# Overview

Formcarry is an API for form processing, empowering developers to handle form submissions without the need for server-side code. With Formcarry, you can effortlessly collect, process, and integrate form data with various services. Using Pipedream, you can create serverless workflows that react to form submissions by triggering actions within Formcarry or in other apps, streamlining data collection and automation processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Auto-Respond to Form Submissions**: Craft a Pipedream workflow that listens for new Formcarry submissions. Use this to trigger an automated email response, confirming receipt to the user with SendGrid. You can personalize the email response based on the form's content for a tailored experience.

- **Form Submission Data to Google Sheets**: On receiving a new form submission via Formcarry, use Pipedream to add the data to a Google Sheet. This is ideal for lead tracking, survey responses, or managing registration details. It's a great way to keep all submissions organized and easily accessible for further analysis or team sharing.

- **Slack Notification for Support Requests**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to send a Slack message to a support channel when a new support request is submitted through a Formcarry form. Include details from the submission in the message so your team can quickly respond to inquiries or issues.
