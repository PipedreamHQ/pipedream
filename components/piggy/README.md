# Overview

The Piggy API provides a suite of loyalty and reward services allowing businesses to manage customer loyalty programs, offer discounts, and track customer engagement. With Pipedream, you can harness this powerful API to automate various aspects of your loyalty program. You might sync loyalty data with other business systems, trigger emails or notifications based on customer actions, or generate reports on the effectiveness of your loyalty campaigns.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Loyalty Points with CRM**: Automatically update a customer's loyalty points in your CRM whenever they earn or redeem points through Piggy. This ensures all customer touchpoints have the most current information, enhancing personalization and customer service.

- **Rewards Notification System**: Create a system that notifies customers via email or SMS when they're close to a reward, have earned a new reward, or when their reward is about to expire. You could connect Piggy to an email service like SendGrid or a messaging service like Twilio to automate these communications.

- **Automate Monthly Loyalty Reports**: Set up a scheduled workflow on Pipedream to generate monthly reports on loyalty program metrics. This could involve aggregating data from the Piggy API and sending it to Google Sheets, Slack, or an email address, providing regular, actionable insights to the marketing team.
