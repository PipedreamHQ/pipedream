# Overview

The Gupshup API enables developers to build communication solutions with extensive messaging capabilities. On Pipedream, you can harness this power to create serverless workflows that interact with Gupshup's messaging services. Automate sending messages, create chatbots, or build complex communication systems that react to incoming messages or events. The workflows can be triggered by webhooks, schedules, or other apps' events, and you can integrate Gupshup with numerous other services available on Pipedream.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support**: Deploy a chatbot that uses Gupshup to handle incoming customer queries. Integrate with a CRM like Salesforce on Pipedream to fetch customer data and provide personalized responses.

- **Marketing Campaign Tracker**: Send out bulk marketing messages via Gupshup and track responses with Pipedream workflows. Connect to Google Sheets to log responses and analyze the effectiveness of your campaign.

- **Event-Based Notifications**: Set up a workflow that listens for specific triggers—like a new sale in Shopify—and sends out custom notifications through Gupshup to the relevant stakeholders.
