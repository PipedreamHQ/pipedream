# Overview

The Gist API empowers you to automate interactions with your Gist CRM platform, efficiently managing contacts, tags, and conversations. Tapping into this potential with Pipedream allows you to build seamless automation workflows that sync data between Gist and other services, trigger actions based on customer behavior, and keep your sales and support teams aligned with real-time information.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Subscribers to a Mailing List:** Automatically add new subscribers from Gist to your Mailchimp list. When a user subscribes through a Gist form, trigger a Pipedream workflow that adds their contact info to a targeted Mailchimp audience, ensuring they receive your latest marketing emails.

- **Create Support Tickets from Conversations:** Turn Gist conversations into support tickets in Zendesk. Set up a workflow in Pipedream that listens for new messages or tagged conversations in Gist, and automatically creates a corresponding ticket in Zendesk with all the necessary details, streamlining your support process.

- **Update CRM Contacts with Webinar Attendance:** After hosting a webinar via Zoom, use Pipedream to cross-reference attendees with your Gist contacts. Automatically tag contacts who attended the webinar, enriching your CRM with engagement data to inform follow-up campaigns and lead scoring.
