# Overview

The Habitify API lets you interact with your habits and data within the Habitify platform programmatically. By leveraging this API in Pipedream, you can automate custom workflows that help track habits, measure progress, and push notifications, among others. Pipedream's serverless platform makes it easy to connect Habitify with hundreds of other apps to automate complex tasks without writing extensive code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Habit Streak Tracker**: Send a daily summary of your habit streaks to your email or Slack. This workflow can be set to trigger at the end of the day, summarizing which habits you've completed and your current streaks, keeping you motivated.

- **Habit Progress Logger**: Log your Habitify data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. Each time you mark a habit as done in Habitify, the workflow triggers and records the habit, the completion time, and the date in a new row in Google Sheets, giving you a detailed and customizable log of your progress.

- **Motivational Reminders**: Connect Habitify with Twilio to send SMS reminders for habits you havenâ€™t marked off halfway through your day. This workflow can help ensure you stay on track with your habits by providing that extra nudge when needed.
