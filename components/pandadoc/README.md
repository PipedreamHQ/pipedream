# Overview

The PandaDoc API opens up a realm of possibilities for automating document workflows, creating a seamless bridge between document management and various business processes. With it, you can programmatically create, send, and track documents, streamline electronic signatures, and manage templates, among others. Integrations through Pipedream can harness these capabilities, enabling you to trigger actions in PandaDoc based on events from other apps, or vice versa.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sales Pipeline Automation**: When a new deal is marked as "won" in a CRM like Salesforce, trigger a PandaDoc workflow to automatically generate a contract from a template, fill it with the deal details, and send it out for e-signature.

- **HR Onboarding Processes**: Sync PandaDoc with an HR platform like BambooHR. Once a new employee is added to the HR system, kick off a workflow that auto-populates and sends out onboarding paperwork through PandaDoc.

- **Real-time Notifications**: Combine PandaDoc with a messaging platform like Slack. Set up a workflow that sends a message to a designated channel or direct message when a document is completed or a specific action is taken on a document in PandaDoc.
