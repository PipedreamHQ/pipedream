# Overview

The Roam Research API lets you interact with Roam's knowledge graph, enabling programmatic access for creating, querying, and modifying notes. This capability opens up automated workflows that can enrich your notes with data from various sources, sync your Roam database with external tools, or even trigger actions based on updates within your notes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Daily Notes Creation**: Use Pipedream's cron job feature to trigger a workflow that automatically creates a new note in Roam Research every morning, pre-populated with your custom template including tasks, goals, or any relevant links and resources for the day.

- **Content Aggregator**: Combine Roam Research with RSS feeds or any news API available on Pipedream. Set up a workflow that fetches the latest news articles or blog posts and adds them as bullet points or pages in your Roam Research database, ensuring you never miss important updates in your fields of interest.

- **Twitter Integration for Idea Capture**: Connect Roam Research with Twitter using Pipedream. Whenever you like a tweet, the workflow saves the tweet's content as a note in your Roam database. This can be a great way to capture ideas and inspirations on the go, essentially using Twitter as a funnel into your personal knowledge management system.
