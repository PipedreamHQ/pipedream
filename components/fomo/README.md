# Overview

The Fomo API enables real-time social proof by broadcasting customer interactions, like purchases or sign-ups, to site visitors, fostering a sense of urgency and trust. Leveraging this API on Pipedream, developers can create dynamic, event-driven workflows that respond to these social cues with automated actions like sending emails, updating CRM records, or triggering custom notifications.

# Example Use Cases

- **Boost Email Marketing with Real-time Triggers**: When a new purchase event is broadcasted by Fomo, a Pipedream workflow can automatically capture this event and use it to trigger a personalized follow-up email to the buyer, perhaps offering a discount on their next purchase or requesting a product review.

- **Enhanced Customer Relations with CRM Integration**: Upon receiving a new 'sign-up' event via Fomo, Pipedream can seamlessly update a CRM platform like Salesforce or HubSpot, adding the new user to a targeted outreach campaign, ensuring they're engaged with relevant content from the outset.

- **Social Proof Driven Inventory Management**: Fomo's 'product sold' events can be utilized by Pipedream workflows to monitor sales in real-time, interfacing with inventory management systems to adjust stock levels, reorder products, or analyze sales trends for future planning.
