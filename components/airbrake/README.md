# Overview

The Airbrake API facilitates real-time error monitoring and automatic exception reporting for your web applications, giving you instant insight into issues as they arise. With this API, you can create custom notifications, analyze and aggregate error data, and manage your project's error trends. Leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can automate workflows that respond to these errors, connect with other services for enhanced issue resolution, and maintain a smooth operation within your development and production environments.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Error Response System**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when Airbrake captures a new error. This could automatically create a GitHub issue for the development team, send an alert message to a Slack channel, and log the error on a Google Sheet for record-keeping.

- **Error Trend Analysis and Reporting**: Set up a scheduled Pipedream workflow that fetches error reports from Airbrake, analyzes them for frequency and type, and compiles a weekly summary report. This report could then be emailed to the team or posted to a team Confluence page for review.

- **Customer Support Integration**: When Airbrake registers a critical error that may impact customers, trigger a Pipedream workflow that creates a support ticket in Zendesk or another customer support platform. Include error details and affected systems in the ticket to expedite the support process.
