# Overview

Modelry API provides powerful tools for building and deploying machine learning models. It simplifies the process of model training, evaluation, and deployment, enabling developers to focus more on solving problems and less on the intricacies of machine learning infrastructure. With Pipedream, you can seamlessly integrate Modelry with various other apps and services to automate workflows, enhance data analytics, and push the boundaries of what's possible with AI-driven automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Image Processing Pipeline**: Integrate Modelry with a file storage service like Dropbox or Google Drive on Pipedream. Whenever new images are uploaded to a designated folder, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends these images to Modelry for analysis or enhancements, then save the processed images back to the storage service. This is ideal for businesses needing automated image enhancements or analytics.

- **Real-Time Data Model Training**: Connect Modelry to data streams from IoT devices via MQTT or HTTP hooks in Pipedream. Use the incoming data to continuously train or re-train machine learning models in Modelry. This is crucial for applications like predictive maintenance where model accuracy impacts operational efficiency.

- **Customer Sentiment Analysis**: Combine Modelry with customer interaction platforms such as Zendesk or Intercom on Pipedream. Analyze customer support tickets or chat messages using Modelry to determine sentiment and other emotional metrics. Use this data to trigger specific workflows like escalating issues, sending personalized offers, or improving product or service offerings based on customer feedback.
