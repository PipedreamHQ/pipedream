# Overview

The Timing app provides detailed time tracking capabilities, enabling users to automatically log time spent on various tasks and improve productivity. Using Pipedreamâ€™s integration, one could build workflows that trigger when new time entries are created, sync time data with other project management tools, or compile reports for invoicing and accountability. It's all about harnessing the power of automated time tracking to streamline processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Time Entries with Project Management Tools:** Automatically sync time entries from Timing to a project management app like Trello or Asana. When a new time entry is logged in Timing, a Pipedream workflow can create a corresponding task or log the time in the other app, keeping project statuses up to date.

- **Generate Weekly Time Reports:** Use Timing with Pipedream to generate weekly time reports. Set up a workflow to aggregate time entries for the week, calculate total hours, and then send the report via email or Slack. This can be a boon for freelancers and consultants who need to provide regular updates to clients.

- **Invoice Creation and Delivery:** Connect Timing to an invoicing platform like QuickBooks or Stripe. When a project reaches a certain number of hours or the end of a billing period, the workflow can compile time entry data, create an invoice, and even send it out to the client automatically.
