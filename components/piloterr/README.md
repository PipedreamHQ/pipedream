# Overview

Piloterr API allows you to integrate and automate various aspects of project management and team collaboration. Within Pipedream's serverless platform, you can leverage this API to create custom workflows, connecting Piloterr's capabilities with other apps to streamline operations, trigger actions based on project updates, and synchronize data across different tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Task Creation from Emails**: Create a workflow that listens for incoming emails on a designated address. Use this to automatically generate tasks in Piloterr, ensuring that requests sent via email are promptly converted into actionable items within your project management system.

- **Sync Project Updates to Slack**: Set up a workflow that triggers whenever there's an update in Piloterr, such as task completion or status changes. Use this trigger to send notifications to a Slack channel, keeping your team informed about project progress in real-time.

- **Aggregate Time Tracking Data**: Design a workflow that periodically retrieves time tracking data from Piloterr. Connect this data with a reporting app like Google Sheets or Data Studio to analyze productivity trends and optimize team performance.
