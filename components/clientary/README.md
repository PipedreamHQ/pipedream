# Overview

The Clientary API allows you to automate and integrate Clientary's project management, time tracking, and invoicing functionalities within Pipedream. By leveraging this API, you can create custom workflows to streamline operations, such as syncing new invoices with accounting software, triggering notifications based on project updates, or automating time tracking entries. Pipedream acts as the glue, enabling you to connect Clientary with hundreds of other apps to create sophisticated, serverless workflows tailored to your business needs.

# Example Use Cases

- **Invoice Synchronization Workflow**: Automate the process of synchronizing newly created invoices in Clientary with your accounting software like QuickBooks. Every time an invoice is generated in Clientary, the workflow triggers, extracts the invoice details, and posts them to QuickBooks, keeping your accounts up to date without manual entry.

- **Project Update Notifications Workflow**: Set up a workflow that sends real-time notifications via Slack or email when there's an update on any project within Clientary. Whether it's a status change or a new comment, you'll get an instant alert, ensuring that your team stays informed and can react swiftly to project developments.

- **Automated Time Entry Workflow**: Integrate Clientary with time-tracking tools like Toggl. When a time entry is stopped in Toggl, a Pipedream workflow can capture this event and automatically create a corresponding time entry in Clientary. This removes the redundancy of logging time across multiple platforms and ensures that billing is always up-to-date.
