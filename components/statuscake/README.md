- Create a custom dashboard that shows performance statistics, such as uptime, latency and response times.
- Create an alert system that emails or texts you whenever your website is down.
- Track the load time of webpages, and set thresholds to determine when performance is affected.
- Automate the creation and configuration of tests, such as ping testing and URL checking.
- Generate performance reports on a regular basis, to keep up with changing trends in usage.
- Create an API key to securely monitor your website from external applications.

This is only a small subset of the types of applications you can build using the Statuscake API. With its extensive selection of features, you can create powerful monitoring solutions for both small and large scale websites.
