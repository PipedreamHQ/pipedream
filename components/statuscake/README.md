# Overview

Using the Statuscake API, you can build a variety of applications to monitor
and manage your website's performance. Here are a few examples:

- Create a custom dashboard that shows performance statistics, such as uptime,
  latency and response times.
- Create an alert system that emails or texts you whenever your website is
  down.
- Track the load time of webpages, and set thresholds to determine when
  performance is affected.
- Automate the creation and configuration of tests, such as ping testing and
  URL checking.
- Generate performance reports on a regular basis, to keep up with changing
  trends in usage.
- Create an API key to securely monitor your website from external
  applications.

This is only a small subset of the types of applications you can build using
the Statuscake API. With its extensive selection of features, you can create
powerful monitoring solutions for both small and large scale websites.
