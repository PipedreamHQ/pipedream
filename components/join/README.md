# Overview

The Join API allows for pushing notifications, URLs, files, and commands between devices connected to a user's Google account. By leveraging Join with Pipedream, you can automate cross-device messaging and data sharing. It's a bridge that connects your devices, enabling them to work in tandem through automated workflows. With Pipedream's capacity for integration, you can trigger events from a plethora of apps to send data to your devices via Join or vice versa.

# Example Use Cases

- **Notification Forwarding**: Send notifications from any of your apps or services directly to your Android device. For instance, trigger a Pipedream workflow with a GitHub webhook when a new issue is created, and use Join to push a notification to your phone alerting you to the new issue.

- **URL Sharing for Quick Access**: Automatically send URLs from a monitored email address to your browser. Use Pipedream to watch for incoming emails with Zapier Email Parser, extract URLs, and then push them to your devices with Join, so you can quickly open webpages on the go.

- **File Transfers Between Devices**: Set up a workflow to move files from cloud storage services like Dropbox to your device. Whenever a new file is added to a specified Dropbox folder, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that sends the file to your Android tablet or phone via Join, keeping all your devices in sync.
