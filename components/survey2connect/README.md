# Overview

The Survey2Connect API grants you the power to automate and integrate your survey data with ease. With this API on Pipedream, you can streamline survey logistics, responses, and analytics, making your data work harder for you. Fetch survey results, manage contacts, and trigger actions in real-time as responses come in. It's a dynamic way to connect feedback with your existing tools and workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Feedback Collection to CRM**: When a new survey response is received, automatically add or update the contact details in your CRM system. This ensures that customer data is current and actionable.

- **Sync Survey Responses to Google Sheets**: On new survey completion, append the respondent's answers to a Google Sheet. This creates a live data repository for analysis without manual entry.

- **Trigger Email Campaigns Based on Survey Data**: If a survey response indicates a specific interest or issue, trigger a targeted email campaign from a platform like SendGrid or Mailgun to address the respondent's preferences or concerns.
