# Overview

The SailPoint API enables the automation of identity governance tasks, streamlining user access management, compliance controls, and security policies across an organization's IT environment. It's a powerful tool for managing identities, entitlements, and role-based access controls, ensuring that the right people have the right access at the right time. With Pipedream, you can use this API to create workflows that react to specific events, orchestrate multi-step processes, and integrate with other services to enhance identity operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated User Onboarding and Offboarding**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a new employee is added to your HR system, such as BambooHR. Automatically create accounts in SailPoint, assign appropriate access rights based on role, and send an email to the new user with their account details using SendGrid. Conversely, when an employee leaves, ensure access is revoked across all systems and confirm deprovisioning with a message to a Slack channel.

- **Periodic Access Reviews and Compliance Audits**: Schedule a recurring workflow in Pipedream that initiates an access review process in SailPoint. Fetch a list of users and their access rights, compare it against compliance requirements or a predefined access matrix, and flag any discrepancies. The workflow could then open a ticket in a system like ServiceNow, requesting review and adjustment of access rights.

- **Real-time Security Alerts and Remediation**: Monitor SailPoint for irregular access patterns or policy violations using Pipedream's event sources. On detecting an anomaly, the workflow could post an alert to a security team's Slack channel, create an incident in PagerDuty, and temporarily suspend the user's access pending investigation, all automatically, reducing response time and potential security risks.
