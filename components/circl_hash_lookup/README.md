# Overview

The CIRCL Hash Lookup API offers a way to check files against known hashes to detect potential threats or verify file integrity. Within Pipedream's serverless platform, you can leverage this API to automate security checks, integrate with your existing cloud storage solutions, or enhance your incident response workflows by cross-referencing file hashes against CIRCL's extensive database. Pipedream's ability to connect to hundreds of apps allows you to create multifaceted workflows that trigger on various events, process data, and invoke the Hash Lookup API to provide real-time security analysis.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Security Alerts**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever new files are uploaded to your cloud storage (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive). Extract the hash of each file and use the CIRCL Hash Lookup API to check if the file is potentially harmful. Send an alert using apps like Slack, PagerDuty, or email if a threat is detected.

- **Continuous Monitoring for File Integrity**: Schedule a Pipedream workflow to regularly scan file hashes in your database or a specified directory. Use the Hash Lookup API to ensure none of the files have been tampered with or replaced by known malicious hashes. Record the results in a Google Sheet or send them to a logging service like Datadog.

- **Incident Response Enrichment**: When your monitoring tools detect a potential security incident, trigger a Pipedream workflow to collect related file hashes. Run these hashes through the CIRCL Hash Lookup API to enrich incident reports with information on whether these files are listed as known malware. Integrate with ticketing systems like Jira or Zendesk to automatically update incident tickets with the lookup results.
