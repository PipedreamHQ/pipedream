# Overview

Shipcloud is a shipping service provider API that streamlines parcel shipping processes for businesses of all sizes. With Shipcloud, you can access multiple carriers, compare shipping rates, create shipping labels, track parcels, and handle returns within a single interface. Utilizing this API on Pipedream enables automation of shipping workflows, leading to efficient and scalable logistics operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Order Fulfillment**: Integrate Shipcloud with an e-commerce platform like Shopify on Pipedream. When a new order is placed, the workflow triggers automatically, creating a shipping label with Shipcloud and updating the order status with the tracking information.

- **Inventory Management Sync**: Connect Shipcloud to an inventory management app like Airtable. When a shipment status updates to 'delivered' on Shipcloud, the workflow updates the inventory count in Airtable, ensuring stock levels are always accurate.

- **Customer Notification System**: Pair Shipcloud with a CRM platform like HubSpot. Set up a workflow where, upon shipment creation or status change, an automated email or SMS is sent to the customer with the tracking details and expected delivery date, improving customer experience.
