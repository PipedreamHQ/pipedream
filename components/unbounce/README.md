# Overview

The Unbounce API lets you tap into the powerful landing page platform to automate tasks and sync data with other services. Use it within Pipedream workflows to capture, analyze, and act on leads generated through your landing pages. Think of fetching form submissions, updating leads in a CRM, or dynamically modifying landing page content.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Submissions to Google Sheets**: Automatically add new Unbounce form submissions to a Google Sheet for easy tracking and analysis. This workflow can help you keep a running log of leads without manual data entry.

- **Trigger Email Campaigns with Mailchimp**: Once a visitor submits a form on your Unbounce page, trigger an email campaign in Mailchimp. This creates a seamless follow-up process to engage leads immediately.

- **Update CRM Contacts in Salesforce**: When a new lead is captured via Unbounce, create or update a contact in Salesforce. This ensures your sales team has the latest information without manual updates.
