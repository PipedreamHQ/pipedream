# Overview

The Kartra API allows you to interact programmatically with Kartra's marketing automation platform. Through Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create, update, retrieve, and delete various marketing and sales assets managed by Kartra, such as leads, emails, memberships, and more. By integrating Kartra with other apps on Pipedream, you can automate complex workflows, sync data across multiple platforms, and trigger actions based on events within Kartra or external services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Synchronize Kartra Leads with a CRM**: Automatically export new leads from Kartra to a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. When a new lead is captured in Kartra, the workflow triggers, sending lead data to your CRM, ensuring your sales team has the latest information at their fingertips.

- **Automate Customer Onboarding**: Once a new user purchases a membership in Kartra, trigger a Pipedream workflow to enroll them in an onboarding course in an external Learning Management System (LMS) like Teachable. Additionally, send a personalized welcome email from a service like SendGrid to the new member.

- **Dynamic Email Campaigns Based on User Activity**: Monitor user interactions on your website or app (tracked by Kartra), and use this data to trigger targeted email campaigns. For example, if a user views a specific product but doesn't purchase, Pipedream can initiate a follow-up email sequence via an email marketing service like Mailchimp to encourage conversion.
