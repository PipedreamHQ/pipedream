# Overview

The easyhire API offers powerful tools for automating and enhancing the recruitment process by enabling seamless integration of various hiring functionalities into Pipedream workflows. With this API, users can automate candidate tracking, streamline interview scheduling, and manage communications, thereby improving recruitment efficiency and candidate experience.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Candidate Screening**: Create a Pipedream workflow that triggers when a new candidate applies via your careers page (using a webhook). The workflow can automatically add the candidate’s details to easyhire, send an initial screening email, and schedule them for an initial interview if they meet predefined criteria.

- **Interview Feedback Compilation**: After an interview, use a Pipedream workflow to automatically collect feedback from interviewers via forms linked to easyhire. This workflow can consolidate feedback and update the candidate’s status in easyhire, helping hiring teams make quicker and informed decisions.

- **Onboarding Process Initiation**: Once a candidate accepts an offer, use a Pipedream workflow to trigger an onboarding process within easyhire. The workflow can setup tasks in a project management tool like Trello or Asana, send welcome emails, and prepare necessary onboarding documentation, ensuring a smooth start for the new hire.
