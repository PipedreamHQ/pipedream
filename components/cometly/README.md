# Overview

The Cometly API allows you to track ad performance and automate the analysis and optimization of advertising campaigns. With Pipedream, you can create serverless workflows that interact with the Cometly API to streamline campaign management tasks, such as retrieving campaign metrics, updating ad spend, and generating performance reports. Using Cometly in conjunction with Pipedreamâ€™s robust integration capabilities, you can connect to numerous other services to enrich your ads data, automate actions based on performance thresholds, and synchronize your marketing efforts across platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Campaign Metrics to Google Sheets**: Extract daily ad performance metrics from Cometly and append them to a Google Sheets spreadsheet for easy tracking and visualization. This workflow enables you to maintain an up-to-date record of your campaign's progress and share it with your team or clients.

- **Slack Alerts for Performance Thresholds**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that monitors your Cometly campaign metrics and sends alerts to a Slack channel when performance dips below a certain threshold. This immediate notification allows for quick reaction to optimize campaigns and control ad spend.

- **Email Reports with Mailgun**: Generate weekly performance reports by aggregating Cometly ad data and using Mailgun to send customized email summaries to stakeholders. This workflow ensures regular updates on campaign status and ROI, helping with informed decision-making.
