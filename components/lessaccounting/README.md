# Overview

The LessAccounting API allows you to automate accounting tasks by providing endpoints for managing transactions, invoices, expenses, and contacts. Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform leverages this by enabling you to create workflows that can respond to events, process data, and integrate with other apps. With Pipedream, you can craft custom automation sequences, sync data across applications, and build powerful integrations without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Invoice Creation and Notification**: When a sale is completed in your e-commerce system, use Pipedream to trigger an automation that creates an invoice in LessAccounting. Then, send a notification to the sales team via Slack, and email the invoice to the customer.

- **Expenses Tracking and Reporting**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream that monitors your bank transactions via webhook or scheduled polling. When a new expense is detected, automatically create an expense entry in LessAccounting and forward a weekly report to Google Sheets for easy visualization and sharing.

- **Sync Contacts Between CRM and Accounting**: Whenever a new contact is added to your CRM platform, such as Salesforce, a Pipedream workflow can be triggered to create or update the corresponding contact in LessAccounting, ensuring your accounting records always stay in sync with your customer database.
