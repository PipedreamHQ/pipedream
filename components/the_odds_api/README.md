# Overview

With The Odds API on Pipedream, you can access a range of bookmakers and exchanges to get live and upcoming sports odds. This integration allows you to create workflows for odds comparison, betting opportunities, or even to power a custom alerting system for when odds reach a certain threshold. The data provided by The Odds API can be used to inform decisions or feed into other apps for enhanced functionality.

# Example Use Cases

- **Odds Monitoring to Slack**: Set up a serverless workflow that polls The Odds API for the latest odds and sends updates directly to a Slack channel. This is ideal for teams that want real-time updates on sports events.

- **Odds Change Alerts via Email**: Create a workflow where Pipedream watches specific odds from The Odds API, and when those odds change beyond a set percentage, it triggers an automated email notification. This can keep gamblers or betting analysts informed of significant market moves.

- **Data Aggregation with Google Sheets**: Use Pipedream to fetch odds from various sports and competitions, and automatically populate a Google Sheet with the data. This can serve as a powerful tool for tracking odds over time and analyzing trends for betting strategies.
