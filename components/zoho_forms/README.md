# Overview

Zoho Forms API allows you to automate interactions with your forms and the data you collect. Leveraging Pipedream, you can harness this API to trigger workflows upon new form submissions, manipulate form entries, and sync data with other services. Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform simplifies integrating Zoho Forms with hundreds of other apps, empowering you to create custom, scalable workflows without hosting or managing servers.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Lead Capture to CRM**  
  Capture leads using Zoho Forms and instantly add them to a CRM like Salesforce. When a new form submission occurs, the workflow triggers, extracting the submission data and creating a new lead record in Salesforce, ensuring that no lead falls through the cracks.

- **Sync Form Data to Google Sheets**  
  Keep a real-time Google Sheets log of every Zoho Forms submission. Each time a form is submitted, Pipedream's workflow adds a new row to your designated Google Sheet. This is ideal for sharing submission data with team members who prefer working within spreadsheets.

- **Form Submission Notifications via Slack**  
  Get instant notifications in a Slack channel whenever a form is submitted. This Pipedream workflow listens for new submissions on Zoho Forms and then posts a custom message with the submission details to your chosen Slack channel, keeping your team updated in real-time.
