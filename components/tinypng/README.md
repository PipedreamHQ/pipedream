# Overview

The TinyPNG API is a set of REST or JSON APIs that can be used to compress and
optimize images for websites. This can help speed up webpage loading, reduce
bandwidth costs, and create a better user experience for visitors. With the
API, developers can create automated image compression processes, compress
images in bulk, and integrate image compression directly into applications or
websites. Here are a few examples of what developers can build using the
TinyPNG API:

- Image compression web tools
- Bulk image compression tools
- Image optimizers for websites
- Image optimization plugins for CMSs
- Automatic image compression services
- Image optimization apps for mobile devices
