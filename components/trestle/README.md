# Overview

The Trestle API provides a platform for real estate data integration, offering access to listings, open houses, and other relevant data. It's designed for developers building applications that require up-to-date real estate information. On Pipedream, you can harness this data to create automated workflows that respond to changes in listings, sync data between platforms, or generate real-time analytics.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real Estate Listing Notifications**: Create a workflow that monitors new listings on Trestle and sends out email alerts via a service like SendGrid. This can keep potential buyers or real estate agents informed about new properties that match their criteria.

- **Property Data Sync to a CRM**: Implement an automation that periodically fetches updated property listings from Trestle and syncs them with customer records in a CRM like Salesforce. This ensures sales teams have the latest information at their fingertips.

- **Market Analysis Reporting**: Build a workflow that gathers data on recent property sales from the Trestle API and feeds it into a tool like Google Sheets or Tableau for advanced analysis and visualization, providing insights into market trends.
