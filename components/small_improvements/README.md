# Overview

The Small Improvements API allows for the automation of feedback, performance reviews, and goals within your organization. It enables interaction with Small Improvements' features, such as requesting feedback, managing users, and reviewing objectives. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to create seamless workflows that trigger actions across various applications, reacting to events in real-time, processing data, and automating repetitive tasks without writing any code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Feedback Collection Post-Project**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a project in your project management tool (like Jira) is marked complete. Use the Small Improvements API to request feedback for team members involved in the project, streamlining the review process and ensuring timely responses.

- **Sync Performance Reviews to HRIS**: After a performance review cycle is completed in Small Improvements, use Pipedream to send the review data to your Human Resources Information System (HRIS), such as BambooHR. This workflow ensures that performance data is centralized, aiding in broader HR processes and analytics.

- **Goal Tracking with Calendar Integration**: When goals are updated or new goals are set in Small Improvements, Pipedream can automatically create or update events in a Google Calendar dedicated to tracking key objectives. This keeps everyone aligned and informed about progress and upcoming goal assessments.
