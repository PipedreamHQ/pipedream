# Overview

The Streamtime API allows you to interact with the Streamtime project management platform, streamlining operations such as task management, time tracking, and project planning. On Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create automated workflows that integrate with various other services, trigger actions based on events, and sync data across apps. It's about connecting Streamtime's capabilities with other tools you use for a seamless project management experience.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Streamtime Projects with Google Calendar**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that listens for new projects or deadlines on Streamtime and automatically adds them as events in Google Calendar. This keeps your schedule up-to-date across platforms without manual entry.

- **Automated Time Tracking Reminders**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that sends a Slack message to team members who haven't logged their time in Streamtime by the end of the day. This ensures that time tracking is kept consistent and helps in accurate project billing.

- **Create Invoices from Completed Tasks**: Build a workflow that watches for tasks marked as completed in Streamtime and uses that data to generate invoices through an accounting app like QuickBooks. This automates the billing process, reducing the time spent on administrative tasks.
