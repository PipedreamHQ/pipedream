# Overview

Robly API enables seamless integration of Robly's email marketing tools with other services. Pipedream acts as a bridge, automating tasks between Robly and various apps to streamline email campaigns, subscriber management, and analytical reporting. Using Pipedream with Robly API, you can trigger workflows based on subscriber activity, sync contact lists across platforms, and automate email campaign follow-ups, enhancing the efficiency and personalization of marketing efforts.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Subscribers to CRM**: Automatically add new subscribers from Robly to a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. When a subscriber joins a Robly list, Pipedream detects the event and creates or updates the subscriber's record in the CRM, ensuring that contact information is consistent and up-to-date across platforms.

- **Distribute Lead Magnets**: When a user signs up for a lead magnet on your website, use Pipedream to automatically enroll them in the corresponding Robly email campaign, delivering the content directly to their inbox. This workflow can be extended by tracking the delivery and open rates, enabling targeted follow-ups based on subscriber engagement.

- **Automate Feedback Collection Post-Campaign**: After an email campaign is sent, trigger a workflow that waits a specific duration, then sends a follow-up email through Robly asking for feedback. Integrate with survey tools like Typeform or Google Forms, and use Pipedream to record responses back in Robly for segmentation or further analysis.
