# Overview

The Abstract - Email Verification API allows you to verify the validity and quality of an email address. With this API, you can confirm if an email exists, is formatted correctly, and is not a temporary or disposable address. Integrating this API with Pipedream workflows offers numerous possibilities, such as filtering out fake email addresses from sign-up processes, maintaining email list hygiene, or automating customer outreach by ensuring that communications only go to verified emails.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sign-Up Form Validation Workflow**: When a new user signs up on your platform, trigger a Pipedream workflow to verify the email using the Abstract - Email Verification API. If the email is valid, proceed with the sign-up process; if not, prompt the user for a different email. This can cut down on fraudulent sign-ups and maintain the integrity of your user base.

- **Scheduled Email List Cleaning**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to run on a schedule (e.g., monthly) that iterates through your email list, uses the Abstract - Email Verification API to check each address, and then updates the status in your database. Connect this with a CRM app like Salesforce to automatically keep your customer contact data clean and up-to-date.

- **Real-Time Lead Verification for Marketing**: Integrate the Abstract - Email Verification API into a workflow that triggers when a lead submits their contact info via a marketing form. Verify the email in real-time and only pass the qualified leads to your sales team or email marketing software like Mailchimp for further engagement.
