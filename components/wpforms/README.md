# Overview

The WPForms API allows users to interact with WPForms data programmatically. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to automate tasks like managing form entries, updating forms, and triggering workflows based on form submissions. This connectivity opens up a wealth of possibilities for integrating with other services, like CRMs, email marketing tools, and databases, to streamline your processes and make data work for you.

# Example Use Cases

- **Instant Slack Notifications for New WPForms Submissions**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a new form submission is received in WPForms. The workflow can then send a message to a designated Slack channel with the submission details, ensuring that your team promptly receives the information.

- **Automate Contact Creation in Salesforce from WPForms Entries**: Set up a workflow where each new WPForms submission is automatically added as a new contact in Salesforce. This eliminates the need for manual data entry and keeps your customer information synchronized across your marketing and sales platforms.

- **Sync WPForms Submissions to Google Sheets for Reporting**: Every time a form is submitted via WPForms, trigger a Pipedream workflow to append the submission data to a Google Sheet. This can be useful for creating real-time reports, data backups, or sharing form data with team members who prefer to work within spreadsheets.
