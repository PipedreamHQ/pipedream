# Overview

Heyzine API allows users to create and manage interactive, digital flipbooks from PDFs. With this API, you can automate the conversion of documents into engaging flipbooks, update existing flipbooks, manage pages, and integrate viewer statistics into analytics tools. Using Pipedream, you can harness this API to automate workflows, such as generating marketing materials, creating reports from data, or disseminating information in a visually appealing format.

# Example Use Cases

  Automatically convert new marketing PDFs uploaded to Google Drive into flipbooks using Heyzine API. Then, share these flipbooks via Mailchimp to a subscriber list, ensuring that marketing materials are distributed as soon as they are ready.

- **Monthly Report Generation and Distribution**:
  Convert monthly sales report PDFs into flipbooks. Using Heyzine API on Pipedream, set up a workflow where each month's sales data from Salesforce is automatically fetched, converted to a PDF, turned into a flipbook, and then emailed to stakeholders using SendGrid.

- **Real-time Content Publishing in Response to Social Media Trends**:
  Monitor Twitter for specific keywords using the Twitter API. When a trending topic matches your business, automatically fetch related articles stored as PDFs, convert them into flipbooks using Heyzine API, and then publish these flipbooks on your WordPress site to capitalize on trending topics quickly.
