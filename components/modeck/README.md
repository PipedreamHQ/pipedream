# Overview

The MoDeck API offers an interface for managing playlists and videos within their platform, providing endpoints for various operations like retrieving video details, updating playlists, or managing users. Integrating MoDeck with Pipedream allows you to automate interactions with your MoDeck data, such as syncing playlists, updating video statuses, or triggering actions based on video analytics. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can build powerful workflows that react to events in real-time, schedule tasks, and connect MoDeck with hundreds of other services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync MoDeck Playlist with a CMS**: Automate the synchronization of MoDeck playlists with your content management system. Whenever a new video is added to a playlist in MoDeck, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that updates the corresponding content in your CMS, ensuring that your website or app displays the latest videos without manual intervention.

- **Update Video Status on Social Media**: Create a workflow that listens for updates to video statuses in MoDeck, such as a change to 'published'. When a video is published, Pipedream can automatically post an update to social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook, sharing the new content with your audience immediately.

- **Aggregate Video Analytics**: Collect and analyze video performance data from MoDeck. Set up a scheduled workflow on Pipedream to retrieve video analytics from MoDeck on a regular basis. You can then process this data and send it to a Google Sheet or a data visualization tool like Tableau for reporting and further analysis.
