# Overview

The Codat API provides a way to seamlessly integrate and automate financial data processes for businesses. With Codat, you can connect to accounting software, extract company financials, and reconcile transactions in real-time. Whether it's for pulling recent invoices, syncing payment information, or consolidating financial reports, Codat's API acts as a bridge between various accounting platforms and your applications, enabling more efficient financial operations and decision-making.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-time Financial Dashboard**: Sync financial data from multiple sources using Codat into a centralized dashboard on Pipedream. Combine this with Pipedreamâ€™s data stores to cache and display real-time financial KPIs, providing businesses with up-to-date insights into their financial health.

- **Automated Bookkeeping Workflows**: Use Codat to fetch new transactions from different accounting services, then process and categorize them on Pipedream. Connect with Google Sheets or Airtable to log these transactions, creating an automated bookkeeping system that reduces manual entry and potential human error.

- **Invoice Payment Tracking**: Build a workflow that monitors invoice statuses via Codat. Whenever an invoice is marked as paid in the accounting software, trigger a Pipedream workflow that updates your CRM, such as Salesforce, and sends a thank you email to the client using a service like SendGrid or Mailgun.
