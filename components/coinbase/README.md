# Overview

The Coinbase API on Pipedream allows you to craft automated workflows that can manage your cryptocurrency assets efficiently. Through the API, you can get real-time information about exchange rates, your transaction history, and account balances. Automate buying and selling decisions based on set criteria, receive notifications for price changes, and synchronize your Coinbase data with other financial tracking tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Trading Bot**: Create a workflow that triggers a buy or sell order based on specific market conditions. For example, if Bitcoin drops to a certain price, the workflow could automatically purchase a predefined amount of Bitcoin.

- **Real-time Alerts**: Set up a workflow that monitors the prices of your favorite cryptocurrencies and sends you real-time alerts through email, SMS, or Slack when certain price thresholds are crossed.

- **Portfolio Synchronization**: Build a workflow that periodically fetches your transaction history and balance from Coinbase and updates a Google Sheet, allowing you to maintain an up-to-date view of your portfolio alongside other investments.
