# Overview

The KickoffLabs API enables you to automate your referral marketing campaigns by integrating with their service. With this API, you can programmatically manage campaigns, leads, and rewards, allowing you to dynamically respond to new sign-ups or reward achievements. By connecting the KickoffLabs API to Pipedream, you can create powerful workflows that react to events in real-time, synchronize data across multiple services, or even trigger custom logic tailored to your marketing strategy.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Leads to CRM**: Capture new leads from KickoffLabs in real-time and add them to your CRM. Use Pipedream to detect when a new lead is created and automatically push that data into a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. This ensures your sales team gets instant access to new prospects.

- **Send Custom Email Notifications**: Send personalized email follow-ups to users who sign up through your KickoffLabs campaign. When someone joins your campaign, use Pipedream to trigger an email through SendGrid or Mailgun with tailored content based on the lead's data, enhancing user engagement.

- **Reward Referral Achievements**: Track and reward successful referrals automatically. Set up a Pipedream workflow to listen for referral achievements on KickoffLabs, then connect to a rewards platform like Tango Card to send gift cards or other digital rewards to users who hit referral milestones.
