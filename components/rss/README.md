# Overview

With the RSS API you have the power to create powerful tools and applications.
RSS is a great way to reliably subscribe to, track and build around your
favorite content sources. Here are **some examples** of things you can create
using the RSS API:

- A personal news website to syndicate articles from multiple sources.
- A custom feed reader to deliver timely notifications of updates and news.
- A live editorial dashboard to track news, trends and public sentiment.
- An automated “report bot” to aggregate and report on news topics.
- A competitor tracking tool to stay on top of industry news.
- A custom RSS-based search engine or RSS-supported deep learning engine.
- A live events feed to notify users and followers of new developments.
