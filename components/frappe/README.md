# Overview

The Frappe API provides a robust interface to interact with the Frappe Framework, enabling developers to create, read, update, and delete records in Frappe apps, trigger workflows, and handle complex business logic. Leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can harness this API to automate tasks, sync data across different platforms, and build powerful serverless workflows that enhance the productivity and efficiency of your business processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Generation and Distribution**: Use the Frappe API to monitor new sales orders and automatically create invoices in Frappe. Then, send these invoices to customers via email using the SendGrid or Mailgun app on Pipedream.

- **Dynamic Inventory Management**: Create a workflow that triggers when stock levels change in an external inventory management system. Use the Frappe API to update the corresponding item quantities in Frappe's Stock module, ensuring real-time inventory accuracy.

- **Customer Feedback Aggregation**: After a customer interaction within a Frappe app, trigger an automated workflow to send a feedback form using Google Forms or Typeform. Collect and store responses in Frappe, analyzing customer satisfaction and response rates over time.
