# Overview

The Dokan API allows you to manage an online marketplace powered by Dokan, an e-commerce solution based on WooCommerce. With this API, you can automate vendor management, product listings, order tracking, and commission calculations. Integrating Dokan with Pipedream opens doors to create powerful serverless workflows that can interact with other services, handle complex automation tasks in your marketplace, and streamline operations without manual intervention.

# Example Use Cases

- **Vendor Onboarding and Management**: Automate the process of adding new vendors to your marketplace. When a vendor submits their details via a web form (like Typeform or Google Forms), Pipedream can capture this data and use the Dokan API to create a new vendor profile, set up their store, and send a welcome email through SendGrid or another email service.

- **Product Inventory Sync**: Keep product listings up-to-date across multiple platforms. For example, if inventory levels change in your ERP system, Pipedream can trigger an update in Dokan to reflect these changes. This ensures that your marketplace is always in sync with your actual stock, preventing overselling and maintaining customer satisfaction.

- **Automated Commission Payouts**: Calculate and disburse vendor commissions automatically. Use Pipedream to schedule a workflow that totals sales for each vendor, calculates the owed commission based on your marketplace's rules, and processes payments through a payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal, minimizing administrative work regarding payouts.
