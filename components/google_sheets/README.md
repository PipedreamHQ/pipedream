# Overview

Some examples of things you can build using the Google Sheets API include:

- A web app that lets users input data into a Google Sheet
- A script that automatically updates a Google Sheet with data from another
  source
- A tool that generates graphs and charts from data in a Google Sheet
- A service that sends data from a Google Sheet to another API or application

Pipedream's use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to any other app will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the Limited Use requirements.
