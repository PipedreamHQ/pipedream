# Overview

The Google Sheets API allows for the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of data within Google Sheets, enabling a robust platform for spreadsheet management and data manipulation. Through Pipedream, you can craft serverless workflows that respond to various triggers, such as webhook events, emails, or scheduled times, to interact with Google Sheets. This synergy can automate reporting, synchronize data across applications, manage inventory, track leads in a CRM, or even conduct survey analysis by updating and retrieving sheet data on the fly.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Entry**: Streamline data collection from various sources like forms or customer interactions directly into Google Sheets. For instance, capture data from Typeform submissions and append them as new rows in a spreadsheet for analysis or record-keeping.

- **Real-time CRM Update**: Keep your CRM and Google Sheets in sync. Whenever a new contact is added to HubSpot, automatically add their details to a designated Google Sheet. This ensures that sales data are always up-to-date and available for team collaboration or reporting.

- **Inventory Management**: Connect Stripe to Google Sheets to monitor product sales. Each time a sale is made, the workflow deducts the sold quantity from the inventory list in a Google Sheet, allowing for real-time inventory tracking and alerts when stock levels are low.
