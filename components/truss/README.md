# Overview

The Truss API enables automation and integration of project management functionalities. With Truss, you can manage tasks, projects, and resources within your organization by automating workflows and connecting to other services. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can create complex automations that respond to events in Truss, manipulate data, and trigger actions in other apps, all without the need to manage infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Truss Projects with Google Calendar**: Automate the synchronization of project deadlines and milestones from Truss to a Google Calendar. When a new project is created or a deadline is updated in Truss, a corresponding event is automatically added or modified in a specific Google Calendar, ensuring all team members have the most up-to-date schedule.

- **Create Truss Tasks from Email**: Convert incoming emails to tasks in Truss. Using Pipedream's email trigger, you can parse emails for specific keywords or from certain senders and automatically create a new task in Truss with the relevant details, streamlining the process of tracking correspondence and action items.

- **Aggregate Truss Data for Reporting**: Build a workflow that periodically fetches data from Truss projects and tasks, then compiles and formats the information into a report. This report could then be sent to Slack, email, or even saved to a Google Sheet for shared access, providing teams with regular updates on project status and progress.
