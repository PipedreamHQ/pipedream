# Overview

ChartHop is an innovative platform that brings clarity and insight into the organizational structure and personnel data of a company. This API essentially serves as a bridge for accessing and manipulating employee data programmatically, allowing for real-time updates, data analysis, and integrations with other business systems. By leveraging the ChartHop API on Pipedream, developers can automate HR operations, synchronize employee data across platforms, and generate analytics and reports, providing a seamless workflow for HR tasks and strategic decision-making.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Employee Onboarding**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream when a new employee is added in ChartHop. This workflow can then send a welcome email using the SendGrid app, schedule onboarding sessions via Google Calendar, and create tasks in Asana for relevant teams to prepare necessary resources.

- **Sync Employee Data to Payroll Systems**: Each time an employee's details are updated in ChartHop, trigger a workflow in Pipedream that automatically updates these details in a payroll system like Gusto. This ensures that payroll information is always accurate and reduces the manual effort required in data maintenance.

- **Generate Monthly HR Reports**: Set up a monthly scheduled workflow in Pipedream that retrieves data from ChartHop, analyzes trends in hiring, turnover, and departmental growth, and compiles this into a comprehensive report using Google Sheets. The report can then be emailed to executives and stakeholders using a connected email service like Outlook.
