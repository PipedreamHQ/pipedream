# Overview

The Nutshell API allows you to access and manage data within the Nutshell CRM platform, enabling you to automate tasks, sync information across apps, and build custom integrations. With Pipedream, these capabilities are harnessed through serverless workflows that can trigger actions within Nutshell or react to events, all with minimal setup. You can create leads, update contacts, manage sales processes, and more, all in a scalable and efficient manner.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Nutshell Leads to Google Sheets**: Automatically push new leads from Nutshell into a Google Sheet for further analysis or record keeping. This workflow can help sales teams keep track of leads without manual data entry.

- **Send Slack Notifications for New Deals**: Set up a workflow where a Slack notification is sent to a specific channel whenever a new deal is created in Nutshell. This keeps the team informed in real-time and can prompt immediate action.

- **Create Nutshell Tasks from Email**: When you receive an email that requires follow-up, have a Pipedream workflow parse the email and create a task in Nutshell. This ensures that nothing falls through the cracks and your CRM tasks are always up-to-date.

# Getting Started

1. Visit [Pipedream Accounts](https://pipedream.com/accounts) and click **Connect an app**.
2. Search for **Nutshell** and select it.
3. Enter your Nutshell API credentials (API URL, email, and API key). You can find these in your [Nutshell API settings](https://app.nutshell.com/settings/api).
4. After connecting, you can use Nutshell triggers and actions in any workflow.

# Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication errors, verify that your API URL, email, and API key are correct in your Nutshell account settings.
