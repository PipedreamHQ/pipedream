# Overview

Updates an existing lead in Nutshell. Only provided fields are updated; custom fields from your Nutshell pipeline can be set via props or passed from a previous step. Changing status to Won or Lost closes the lead.

# Example Use Cases

- Update lead status, description, or tags from another system
- Close leads (mark as Won or Lost) when conditions are met in a workflow

# Getting Started

Connect your Nutshell account in the step. See the [Nutshell app README](../../README.md) for account setup.

# Troubleshooting

See the [Nutshell app README](../../README.md) for authentication and API troubleshooting.
