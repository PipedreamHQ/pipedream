# Overview

The Omniconvert API is a powerful tool that allows you to quickly build
automated optimization experiments and reports. With Omniconvert, you can
implement A/B tests, segmentation analysis, segment analytics, behavioral data,
and more.

Using Omniconvert, you can build and deploy a variety of optimizations for your
site. Here are some examples:

- Implement A/B testing to compare different versions of a page to determine
  the best design for maximum conversions.
- Analyze user behavior and segmentation by designing custom reports to track
  user interactions or drop offs.
- Utilize segmentation analytics to understand user behaviour and take action
  from the results.
- Create automated optimization experiments to monitor, adjust, and optimize
  the performance of pages.
- Gather real-time user data, such as for promotions or abandoned carts, to
  boost conversion rates.
- Leverage behavioral data to create audiences for further optimization and
  targeting.
