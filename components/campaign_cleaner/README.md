# Overview

The Campaign Cleaner API offers tools to clean and verify email lists, improving email campaign performance and sender reputation. By integrating with Pipedream, you can automate workflows that enhance your email marketing efforts. Use the API to check the validity of email addresses, remove duplicates, and classify email types. Pipedream's serverless platform allows you to trigger these processes from various events, schedule them, or manually invoke them as needed.

# Example Use Cases

- **Email Verification on User Signup**: When a new user signs up on your website, automatically verify their email address using the Campaign Cleaner API. Connect this with your authentication system to ensure only valid emails are added to your database.

- **Scheduled Email List Cleaning**: Set up a recurring Pipedream workflow that periodically cleans your entire email list. Use Campaign Cleaner to remove invalid, disposable, or duplicate email addresses, maintaining a high-quality list for better engagement rates.

- **Subscriber Classification and Segmentation**: Classify and segment your subscribers based on the analysis from Campaign Cleaner. Integrate with email marketing apps like Mailchimp or SendGrid to create targeted campaigns for different types of email addresses, such as personal, business or role-based.
