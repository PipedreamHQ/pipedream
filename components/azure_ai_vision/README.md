# Overview

The Azure AI Vision API provides powerful image analysis capabilities, enabling you to extract information and insights from your visual data. With this API, you can perform tasks like image classification, object detection, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to recognize text within images. Leveraging Pipedream, you can integrate these AI-powered insights into your workflows to create dynamic and automated processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Moderation Pipeline**: Implement an automated system that scans user-uploaded images for inappropriate content using the Azure AI Vision API. Once processed, images can be tagged, and if necessary, alerts can be sent or content removed automatically, ensuring a safe environment for your community.

- **Digital Asset Management Enhancement**: Augment your digital asset management by automatically tagging images with descriptive labels. Connect Azure AI Vision API to your asset database on Pipedream, so every time a new image is uploaded, it gets analyzed and tagged, making it easier to organize and search for.

- **Real-time Text Extraction for Receipts**: Build a workflow that captures text from uploaded receipt images in real-time. Use the Azure AI Vision API for OCR to extract and parse information, then pipe the data to a spreadsheet app like Google Sheets for expense tracking and reporting.
