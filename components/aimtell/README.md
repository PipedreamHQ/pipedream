# Overview

The Aimtell API provides a suite of web push notification services that enable businesses to send targeted messages directly to their users' browsers. This functionality can be valuable for re-engaging users with personalized content, promoting time-sensitive offers, or providing critical updates. Using Pipedream, you can integrate Aimtell with various apps and services to automate the delivery of web push notifications based on triggers like new email subscribers, eCommerce events, or custom conditions defined by your own data sources.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Email Subscribers to Aimtell**: When a new subscriber is added to your email marketing platform (e.g., Mailchimp), use Pipedream to automatically register that subscriber to receive web push notifications from Aimtell, enhancing multi-channel engagement.

- **Send Push Notifications on New eCommerce Orders**: Connect Aimtell to your eCommerce platform (e.g., Shopify). Whenever a new order is placed, trigger a workflow in Pipedream that sends a personalized push notification to the customer, thanking them for their purchase or offering related products.

- **Automate Push Notifications for User Milestones**: Combine Aimtell with a CRM platform like Salesforce. You can set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for events like a user reaching a certain loyalty tier or anniversary, then sends a celebratory or exclusive offer via Aimtell push notification.
