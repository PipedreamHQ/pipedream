With the GraphHopper API, you can build a variety of applications that make use
of routing, geocoding, and other map-related features. Some examples of what
you can build include:

- A routing application that provides turn-by-turn directions for users
- A geocoding application that helps users find addresses or points of interest
- A mapping application that shows users an interactive map of an area
- An integration with a ride-sharing service that provides directions and
  pickup locations
