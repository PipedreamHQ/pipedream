# Overview

LiveKit is an open-source, scalable, real-time audio and video conferencing API that facilitates the easy integration of video and audio communication into web and mobile applications. Utilizing LiveKit on Pipedream allows developers to automate workflows involving video conferencing features, such as dynamic room management, participant tracking, and real-time event handling.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Webinar Setup**: Automatically create a LiveKit room when a new event is scheduled in Google Calendar. Send out invitations with unique room access links to all participants via Gmail. This workflow can ensure that every scheduled event has a dedicated conferencing space without manual setup.

- **Real-Time Analytics Dashboard**: Connect LiveKit to a logging tool like Datadog on Pipedream to monitor room status and participant activities. Set up triggers in Pipedream to capture specific events (e.g., participant joins or leaves) and push these events to Datadog for real-time analysis and historical reporting.

- **Dynamic Breakout Room Management**: During a large video conference session, use LiveKit with Slack on Pipedream to manage breakout rooms dynamically. Based on participant input or predefined criteria in Slack, automate the creation of breakout rooms in LiveKit and send room URLs back to Slack channels or direct messages to guide participants.
