# Overview

LiveKit is a real-time communication API that enables developers to add video and audio conferencing capabilities to their applications. With the LiveKit API on Pipedream, you can automate aspects of room management, participant handling, and event monitoring, integrating these features seamlessly with other apps and services. This allows for the creation of dynamic and interactive real-time communication environments, enhancing the capabilities of web and mobile applications with minimal latency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Room Management**: Automatically create and delete LiveKit rooms based on calendar events from Google Calendar. For instance, set up a workflow on Pipedream that creates a new LiveKit room when a Google Calendar event starts and deletes it when the event ends, ensuring efficient use of resources and privacy.

- **Real-Time Alerts for Room Events**: Set up real-time notifications via Slack or email whenever specific events occur in a LiveKit room, such as a new user joining, user leaving, or reaching a certain number of participants. This can help moderators or admins stay informed about the activity within their communication channels without having to monitor them manually.

- **Enhanced Security Monitoring**: Integrate LiveKit with services like Sentry to monitor and respond to unusual activities or errors in real-time communication sessions. For example, if there is an unexpected spike in participant numbers that could indicate a breach or a glitch, an alert can be sent to the appropriate team to take immediate action.
