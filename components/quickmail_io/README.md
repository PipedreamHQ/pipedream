# Overview

The QuickMail.io API allows you to automate email outreach and follow-up sequences. With this API, you can manage contacts, create and send new campaigns, and track the performance of your emails. When integrated with Pipedream, you can set up workflows that react to various triggers and perform actions such as adding new leads to a campaign, updating contact information, or triggering a follow-up email based on customer interactions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Users to QuickMail Campaigns**: Automatically add new users from your app (tracked in a platform like Segment) to a specific QuickMail campaign, initiating a welcome or onboarding sequence as soon as they sign up.

- **Trigger Follow-ups Based on Customer Activity**: Use Pipedream to listen for specific events from your product analytics or a CRM like Salesforce, and trigger personalized follow-up emails via QuickMail when a user performs a key action or reaches a certain milestone.

- **Automate Email Reporting with Google Sheets**: Create a workflow that compiles campaign performance statistics from QuickMail and appends them to a Google Sheet. Use this data for regular reporting or to gain insights for optimizing your email strategies.
