# Overview

Zenkit is a versatile project management and collaboration tool that lets you organize your data and build custom workflows to streamline your business and personal projects. With the Zenkit API, you can create, read, update, and delete items in your collections, manage users, and automate notifications or actions based on changes within your datasets. Combining Zenkit's API with Pipedream's capability unlocks powerful automation opportunities, allowing you to interconnect your project data with numerous other services and internal systems to enhance productivity, data consistency, and event-driven processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Tasks with Calendar**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that takes new or updated tasks from Zenkit and syncs them with Google Calendar. Any changes in task due dates or descriptions in Zenkit would automatically update the corresponding calendar event, ensuring your schedule is always up-to-date.

- **Customer Support Ticketing**: Build an automation where new support tickets submitted via a Zenkit form are instantly posted to a Slack channel. This allows for rapid response by your support team. Additionally, the workflow could update the ticket status in Zenkit once it has been acknowledged or resolved by the team.

- **Sales Lead Tracking**: Design a Pipedream workflow that connects Zenkit with a CRM system like Salesforce. When a new sales lead is entered into a Zenkit collection, it triggers the workflow, which then creates or updates the lead information in Salesforce. This ensures that your sales team has the latest data without manual entry, leading to more efficient lead management.
