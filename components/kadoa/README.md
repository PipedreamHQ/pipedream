# Overview

The Kadoa API enables automation and integration of Kadoa's time tracking and project management features. With it, you can manage projects, tasks, time entries, and extract reports programmatically. When combined with Pipedream's ability to connect to hundreds of other services and create complex workflows, the potential for increased efficiency and data connectivity is significant. You can trigger workflows on Pipedream with HTTP requests, schedule them, or even run them in response to emails, among other methods.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Project Time Tracking**: Sync time entries from Kadoa to a Google Sheets document for real-time project time tracking. Every time a new time entry is created in Kadoa, a Pipedream workflow is triggered, appending the time entry details to a designated Google Sheet.

- **Task Creation Notifications**: Automate notifications via Slack whenever a new task is created in Kadoa. A Pipedream workflow listens for a new task event from Kadoa and sends a formatted message to a specific Slack channel, alerting team members about the new task and its details.

- **Sync Projects with Calendar**: Integrate Kadoa projects with Google Calendar, creating calendar events automatically when a new project is added in Kadoa. This Pipedream workflow creates a detailed event in Google Calendar for the project's timeline, helping teams keep track of project due dates and milestones.
