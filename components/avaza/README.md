# Overview

The Avaza API enables integration of project management, time tracking, and invoicing features into custom workflows. With Pipedream, automation between Avaza and other apps becomes seamless, allowing for the streamlining of project updates, financial processes, and team collaboration. Pipedream's serverless platform offers a powerful way to link Avaza's capabilities with numerous other services, triggering actions based on events, and automating repetitive tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Project Status Updates to Slack**: When a project's status changes in Avaza, trigger a workflow in Pipedream that posts an update to a designated Slack channel. This keeps the team informed in real-time about project progress without manual updates.

- **Time Tracking to Google Sheets**: Automate the process of transferring time tracking data from Avaza to a Google Sheet for further analysis and reporting. Once a time entry is added in Avaza, it triggers a Pipedream workflow that appends the entry to a spreadsheet, enabling easier tracking and management of billable hours.

- **Invoice Creation to Email Notification**: When a new invoice is created in Avaza, use a Pipedream workflow to automatically send an email notification to the finance team or the client. This ensures prompt communication and can help speed up the payment process.
