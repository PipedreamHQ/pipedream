# Overview

SatisMeter captures customer feedback and sentiment directly through targeted surveys, providing insights into customer satisfaction and product engagement. With the SatisMeter API on Pipedream, you can automate interactions with survey data, sync customer information with other services, and trigger actions based on feedback scores. By leveraging Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows that respond in real-time to survey results, enrich customer profiles, and influence your product's roadmap with actionable insights.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Feedback Collection into CRM**: Sync SatisMeter survey responses with your CRM, like Salesforce or HubSpot, to update customer profiles with their latest feedback scores. This can help sales and support teams tailor their outreach and support based on up-to-date customer sentiment.

- **Trigger Actions Based on Sentiment Analysis**: Use SatisMeter survey results to perform sentiment analysis. If negative feedback is detected, automatically create a task in a project management tool like Asana or Trello for your customer success team to follow up and address any issues.

- **Email Campaigns Triggered by Survey Responses**: Integrate SatisMeter with email marketing platforms such as Mailchimp or SendGrid. Trigger personalized email campaigns based on specific survey responses to engage customers, provide educational content, or offer incentives to those who may have given lower satisfaction scores.
