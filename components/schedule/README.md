# Overview

The Schedule app in Pipedream is a powerful tool that allows you to trigger workflows at regular intervals, ranging from every minute to once a year. This enables the automation of repetitive tasks and the scheduling of actions to occur without manual intervention. By leveraging this API, you can execute code, run integrations, and process data on a reliable schedule, all within Pipedream's serverless environment.

# Example Use Cases

- **Daily Sales Reports**: Automatically aggregate and send daily sales data from an e-commerce platform such as Shopify to a Google Sheets document every morning. This scheduled workflow could involve fetching the previous day's sales data, processing it, and using the Google Sheets API to update a spreadsheet, providing an up-to-date sales report for quick review.

- **Social Media Posting**: Schedule regular social media posts across platforms like Twitter or Facebook by setting up a workflow that runs weekly. It could select content from a predefined source, like a CMS or database, format the post, and use the respective social media platform's API to publish the content, keeping your social media presence active with minimal effort.

- **Database Backup and Maintenance**: Create a weekly or monthly scheduled workflow to back up your database to a service like Dropbox or AWS S3. It could export the latest database snapshot, compress and encrypt the data, and then store it securely offsite. Additionally, this can be coupled with database maintenance tasks such as cleaning up old logs or optimizing tables.
