# Overview

The Google Chat API allows you to build custom bots for Google Chat, enabling automated interactions with users within a chat space. By leveraging this API on Pipedream, you can create powerful workflows that respond to messages, automate tasks, and connect Google Chat with other services. Pipedream's serverless platform provides a seamless way to invoke these APIs based on triggers from Google Chat or other apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Helpdesk Bot**: Deploy a bot that listens for specific keywords in Google Chat messages. When a user mentions a support-related keyword, the bot can reply with helpful information or create a ticket in a service like Zendesk.

- **Meeting Scheduler**: Set up a workflow that triggers when someone requests a meeting in a Google Chat room. The bot can interact with Google Calendar to find available slots and propose meeting times directly within the chat.

- **CI/CD Notifications**: Integrate with GitHub to send updates on code commits, pull requests, or build statuses from your CI/CD pipeline into a Google Chat room, keeping your development team informed in real-time.
