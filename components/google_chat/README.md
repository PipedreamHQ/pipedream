# Overview

The Google Chat API allows you to build custom bots for Google Chat, enabling automated interactions with users within a chat space. By leveraging this API on Pipedream, you can create powerful workflows that respond to messages, automate tasks, and connect Google Chat with other services. Pipedream's serverless platform provides a seamless way to invoke these APIs based on triggers from Google Chat or other apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Helpdesk Bot**: Deploy a bot that listens for specific keywords in Google Chat messages. When a user mentions a support-related keyword, the bot can reply with helpful information or create a ticket in a service like Zendesk.

- **Meeting Scheduler**: Set up a workflow that triggers when someone requests a meeting in a Google Chat room. The bot can interact with Google Calendar to find available slots and propose meeting times directly within the chat.

- **CI/CD Notifications**: Integrate with GitHub to send updates on code commits, pull requests, or build statuses from your CI/CD pipeline into a Google Chat room, keeping your development team informed in real-time.


# Getting Started

## Creating a Google Chat app
In order to connect your workspace Google Chat account to Pipedream, you'll need do the following:
1. Create a Google Chat app in Google Cloud (a Google workspace account is required).
2. Connect this app using custom OAuth clients on Pipedream. See the directions [here](https://pipedream.com/docs/connected-accounts/oauth-clients) on how to configure a custom OAuth client on Pipedream.

1. Sign in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/)
2. Select an existing project or create a new one

3. Select **APIs & Services**
4. Click **Enable APIs & Services**

  ![Select "Enable APIs & Services to open a menu to enable the Google Chat API for Pipedream to connect to](https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1663268316/docs/components/CleanShot_2022-09-15_at_14.58.06_jshirk.png)

## Connect your Google Chat app Pipedream with your Google Chat app OAuth credentials

At this point, you should have a Google Chat App under your Google Project, and a custom OAuth client on Pipedream. Make sure that the scopes in your custom OAuth client match the scopes you enabled in Google Cloud.

You should now be able to use your Google Chat application that you created on Pipedream!

## Publish your Google Chat app (EXTERNAL ONLY)
Google has a [7 day expiration window](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#:~:text=A%20Google%20Cloud,Connect%20equivalents) on refresh tokens for applications that are set to **External** users with a publishing status of "Testing", so you will need to **Publish** your application in order to maintain your account connection.

1. Navigate to your application, and click **OAuth Consent Screen** on the lefthand sidebar.
2. Under **Publishing status**, click **Publish App**. If you included any sensitive or restricted scopes in your app, there will be a disclosure stating that you will need to go through the process of verification. Click **Confirm**.
3. Your application will not be available externally unless you share your **client_id** with others, and you will not have to go through the verification process unless you intend to onboard over 100 users.
4. The publishing status should be set to **In production**, and your account should maintain its connection without an expiration window.
