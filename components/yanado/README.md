# Overview

Yanado turns your Gmail into a powerful collaboration tool, allowing you to manage tasks and projects directly within your inbox. With the Yanado API, you can automate task creation, project management, task updates, and notifications, syncing your email activities with project workflows. Pipedream's platform empowers you to integrate Yanado with a myriad of other apps, enabling seamless automation of complex workflows that bridge your email communications with task management, CRM updates, calendar scheduling, and more.

# Example Use Cases

- **Email to Task Conversion**: When you receive an email from a new client, Pipedream can automatically create a task in Yanado. Link this to CRM software like Salesforce or HubSpot; when an email is tagged with "new-client", Pipedream creates a new client profile in your CRM and schedules a follow-up task in Yanado.

- **Project Status Updates**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream where updates to tasks in Yanado trigger notifications in Slack. When a task reaches a certain status, such as "In Review", Pipedream sends a message to the designated Slack channel, keeping the team informed without leaving their workspace.

- **Automated Task Prioritization**: Connect Yanado to Google Calendar via Pipedream, so when a meeting is scheduled that pertains to a specific project, a high-priority task is automatically created in Yanado. This ensures that action items from meetings are captured and prioritized correctly, without manual input.
