# Overview

The Osu! API provides programmatic access to game data and user statistics from the Osu! rhythm game platform. Developers can retrieve detailed information about players, scores, beatmaps, and more. Utilizing the Osu! API with Pipedream allows you to automate tasks, create dynamic game data integrations, and interact with other APIs, enriching both player experience and community engagement.

# Example Use Cases

- **Player Stats Dashboard Integration**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that triggers daily to fetch player statistics from the Osu! API. Use this data to update a dashboard in Google Sheets or Data Studio, providing up-to-date stats for players in a community or tournament.

- **Automated Beatmap Updates Alert**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that subscribes to updates on new or updated beatmaps. Use this information to send real-time notifications via Discord or Slack to a group of users who follow specific beatmap creators or genres.

- **Tournament Score Tracking**: Build a workflow that pulls recent scores from specified players participating in an online tournament. Have this data sent to a centralized database or directly into a scoring system, and push event updates or leaderboards notifications to viewers through webhook endpoints or messaging platforms like Telegram.
