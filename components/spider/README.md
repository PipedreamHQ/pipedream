# Overview

The Spider API enables users to scrape and collect data from web pages efficiently. By leveraging this API on Pipedream, you can automate data extraction processes, monitor changes in web content, and integrate scraped data with numerous other apps supported by Pipedream for advanced analytics, reporting, or storage solutions. This functionality is particularly useful for businesses needing up-to-date market data, media monitoring, or competitive analysis.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-time Price Monitoring for E-commerce**: Automatically monitor competitor websites for price changes. When Spider detects a price change on specific products, trigger a workflow in Pipedream that updates a Google Sheets or sends notifications via Slack to the relevant team, allowing for rapid response to market changes.

- **Content Change Alerts for News Outlets and Blogs**: Use Spider to monitor key news sources or blogs for new articles or changes to existing content. When new content is detected, use Pipedream to forward summaries or links to this content directly to an email list using Mailchimp, or post updates to a company's Twitter to keep followers informed.

- **Competitive Analysis Reports**: Schedule regular scrapes of competitor websites to gather intel on new products, marketing strategies, or content updates. Aggregate this data in Pipedream, analyze trends or changes using SQL, and automatically generate and email PDF reports to stakeholders using a service like Dropbox or Google Drive for easy access and review.
