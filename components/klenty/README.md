# Overview

The Klenty API enables automation of your sales engagement by integrating with Pipedream. With this API, you can sync leads, automate email campaigns, and manage tasks without manual intervention, creating a seamless sales workflow. By leveraging Pipedream's serverless execution model, you can set up custom triggers, actions, and data transformations between Klenty and various other apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Synchronization with CRM**: Automatically sync new leads from a CRM like Salesforce to Klenty. When a new contact is added to Salesforce, trigger a Pipedream workflow that creates or updates the lead in Klenty, ensuring your sales team has the latest data.

- **Email Campaign Trigger from E-commerce Actions**: Start a Klenty email sequence when a customer makes a purchase on an e-commerce platform like Shopify. Use Pipedream to detect new orders and trigger personalized follow-up emails through Klenty to encourage repeat business or request reviews.

- **Support Ticket Follow-Up Sequence**: After a support ticket is resolved in a support app like Zendesk, trigger a follow-up email sequence in Klenty to gather feedback or offer additional help. This maintains customer engagement and can provide valuable insights into your support process.
