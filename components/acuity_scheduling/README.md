# Overview

Acuity Scheduling API allows you to tap into the functionality of Acuity Scheduling, a cloud-based appointment scheduling software. With this API on Pipedream, you can automate appointment creation, modifications, and cancellations, as well as sync customer data across your tech stack. The API lets you fetch detailed information about schedules, available time slots, and calendar events. Create dynamic, real-time integrations with CRMs, email marketing platforms, or payment gateways to streamline your scheduling and business processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Appointment Confirmation Emails**: Automate the process of sending customized confirmation emails via SendGrid or another email service when a new appointment is scheduled in Acuity. You can include appointment details, and even a calendar invite, ensuring clients have all the information they need.

- **CRM Contact Update**: When a new client books an appointment, automatically create or update their contact details in a CRM like Salesforce. This workflow ensures that client information is always current and can trigger follow-up tasks or lead nurturing processes within the CRM.

- **Invoice Generation**: After an appointment is completed, trigger an invoice creation in accounting software such as QuickBooks. This workflow can include client details, services rendered, and pricing, and send the invoice straight to the client, streamlining the billing process.
