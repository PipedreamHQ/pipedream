# Overview

Cliengo is a chatbot platform that lets you automate conversations with visitors on your website, aiding in lead capture and customer service. The Cliengo API offers capabilities to programmatically manage these conversations, extract chat data, and integrate with CRM systems. By leveraging Pipedream, you can connect Cliengo to a variety of different apps and services to streamline workflows, such as syncing chat data to your CRM, triggering emails based on chat events, or analyzing customer interaction patterns.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Capture to CRM**: When a visitor engages with the Cliengo chatbot and provides contact information, use Pipedream to automatically add or update this lead in your CRM software, such as Salesforce or HubSpot. This ensures that potential customers are quickly and efficiently integrated into your sales pipeline.

- **Support Ticket Creation**: If a visitor reports an issue via the Cliengo chatbot, set up a workflow using Pipedream to create a support ticket in your helpdesk system like Zendesk. The workflow can include relevant chat data to provide context for the support team, streamlining the resolution process.

- **Chat Analysis and Reporting**: Implement a workflow that regularly collects chat logs through the Cliengo API and sends them to a data analysis tool like Google BigQuery. Here, you can run queries to gain insights into common inquiries or issues, which can then be used to inform business decisions or to optimize the chatbot's responses.
