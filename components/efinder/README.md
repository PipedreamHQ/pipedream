# Overview

The efinder API allows you to search various databases for email addresses associated with a given domain. It's a tool tailored for those in sales, marketing, and recruitment who need to find contact information quickly and reliably. Integrating this API into Pipedream opens up possibilities for automating the process of lead generation, enriching contact lists, or syncing found emails to CRMs and other marketing tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Generation Automation**: Use efinder to search for emails by domain, then automatically add the found emails to a Google Sheets for tracking potential leads. Trigger this search by new domain entries in the sheet and keep your lead list growing without manual intervention.

- **CRM Integration**: Integrate efinder with a CRM like HubSpot. Whenever a new domain is added to your sales pipeline, use efinder to find the emails and automatically populate the contact information in the CRM, ensuring your sales team has the latest info for outreach.

- **Email Verification and Enrichment**: After collecting emails, use efinder in combination with an email verification service like Hunter to verify the emails and append additional information such as the contact's position or social media profiles. This workflow can enhance the quality of your contact lists and improve targeting for campaigns.
