# Overview

The Dynalist API enables programmatic access to the powerful outlining and organizing features of Dynalist, a tool designed for structured note-taking and dynamic lists. With Pipedream, you can automate tasks, sync data, and connect Dynalist to other apps and services to enhance productivity. This could include creating new documents, updating lists, and extracting items for reporting or integration with project management tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Integrate Dynalist with Calendar Apps**: When you create a new item in Dynalist marked with a specific keyword or hashtag, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that automatically adds a corresponding event to your Google Calendar or other calendar services, ensuring your tasks and deadlines are always synchronized.

- **Sync Tasks Between Dynalist and Trello**: You can set up a Pipedream workflow that watches for new checked-off items in Dynalist. Whenever you complete a task in Dynalist, the workflow creates a new card in Trello or updates an existing one, allowing you to maintain an overview of your project's progress across different platforms.

- **Automated Reporting for Completed Items**: Build a Pipedream workflow that periodically retrieves a list of checked items from Dynalist, formats them into a report, and sends this report via email or posts it to a Slack channel. This helps keep teams informed about completed tasks without manual intervention.
