# Overview

The SignerX API enables automation of digital signing processes, offering a robust solution for managing document signatures electronically. Through Pipedream's integration capabilities, users can craft custom workflows that link SignerX with various other apps and services, enhancing efficiency and streamlining operations where signature collection and management are critical. This can include automated reminders for pending signatures, syncing signed documents to cloud storage, or updating records in CRM systems upon completion of signing.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Document Signing Requests with CRM Updates**: When a new contract is added to a CRM platform like Salesforce, trigger a Pipedream workflow to automatically send the document for signature via SignerX. Once signed, update the CRM record with the status of the document to keep all team members informed.

- **Sync Signed Documents to Cloud Storage**: After a document is signed using SignerX, set up a workflow on Pipedream to automatically upload the signed version to a cloud storage service such as Google Drive or Dropbox. This helps in maintaining backups and ensuring compliance with data storage policies.

- **Email Notifications on Signature Completion**: Configure a workflow where, upon the successful completion of a document signing in SignerX, an automated email notification is sent to relevant stakeholders using a service like SendGrid. This can inform them that the document has been signed and is ready for the next steps in the process.
