# Overview

The Customer.guru API is a potent tool for gauging customer satisfaction and Net Promoter Score (NPS). By integrating with Pipedream, you can automate the collection and analysis of customer feedback, trigger targeted actions based on NPS results, and meld those insights with other data sources. Pipedream's serverless platform lets you create workflows that react to Customer.guru events in real-time, enrich customer data, and drive personalized engagements.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Feedback Analysis Workflow**: When Customer.guru sends a new NPS score, the workflow is triggered on Pipedream, automatically analyzing the feedback. The sentiment is parsed and categorized, and if the score falls below a certain threshold, a follow-up task is created in a project management tool like Trello or Asana, prompting timely customer outreach.

- **Real-Time Alerts for High NPS Scores**: Set up a Pipedream process that listens for high NPS score submissions via Customer.guru. When a score over a certain threshold is detected, an immediate alert is sent to a Slack channel, celebrating the customer's positive experience and encouraging the team to maintain high standards.

- **NPS-Triggered Email Campaigns**: A Pipedream workflow leverages high NPS scores by triggering personalized thank-you emails from a marketing platform such as Mailchimp. For detractors, it can initiate a different campaign aimed at collecting detailed feedback, helping you to understand and address their concerns.
