# Overview

WaiverForever offers an API to digitally manage waiver documents, enabling users to streamline the process of creating, signing, and organizing waivers. This API can be a game-changer for businesses that need to handle liability waivers, consent forms, or other types of agreements efficiently. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can automate workflows around these waiver processes, such as triggering actions when a waiver is signed, syncing signed waivers with other databases, or setting up alerts for incomplete documents.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Waiver Confirmation Emails**: When a waiver is signed through WaiverForever, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends a personalized confirmation email to the signee using an email service like SendGrid. This ensures immediate acknowledgment and offers a digital receipt of their signed document.

- **CRM Integration for New Signees**: Integrate WaiverForever with a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform such as Salesforce. Each time a waiver is completed, automatically create or update the customer profile in the CRM with their latest information, ensuring your customer records are always up-to-date.

- **Slack Notifications for Team Awareness**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that posts a notification in a specified Slack channel whenever a new waiver is signed. This is especially useful for teams needing instant updates, like event organizers or activity centers that require real-time awareness of participant sign-ins.
