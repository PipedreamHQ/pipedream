# Overview

NextDNS API on Pipedream allows you to automate DNS management and enrich cybersecurity measures. This API offers control over DNS queries and filtering settings, making it possible to automate domain blocking, security rule updates, and log analysis. Utilizing Pipedream's serverless platform, you can integrate NextDNS with a wide range of services, without the need for a dedicated backend, to enhance network management and threat mitigation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Security Updates**: When a new threat is identified by a threat intelligence platform (e.g., VirusTotal), an automated workflow can trigger NextDNS to immediately add the domain to a blacklist, ensuring network protection against emerging threats.

- **Enhanced Reporting**: Combine NextDNS logs with a data visualization tool like Google Sheets or Data Studio. Set up a scheduled workflow to extract DNS query logs, parse them, and push the data into reports for a clear view of network traffic and blocked queries.

- **IoT Device Management**: For a network with numerous IoT devices, use NextDNS API to manage device-specific DNS configurations. Integrate this with device management platforms to dynamically adjust DNS settings based on device status or location, optimizing performance and security.
