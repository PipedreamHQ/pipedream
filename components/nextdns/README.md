# Overview

NextDNS provides an API that developers can use to programmatically manage DNS
records for their domains. This provides a way to automate tasks such as adding
new records when a website is created, or removing old records when a website
is taken down.

Here are some examples of what you can build using the NextDNS API:

- A tool for automatically creating DNS records when a new website is created
- A tool for automatically removing DNS records when a website is taken down
- A tool for managing DNS records for multiple domains in one place
- A tool for monitoring DNS changes across multiple domains
