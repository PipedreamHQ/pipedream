# Overview

Customer.io is a versatile automation tool that allows you to harness the power of email, SMS, and push notifications to create personalized customer experiences. With its comprehensive API, Customer.io enables you to track customer interactions, segment audiences, and trigger targeted communications based on user behavior and data. By leveraging Pipedream, you can easily connect Customer.io to various other services and APIs to automate complex workflows, synthesize data, and respond to events in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Customer.io Segments with a CRM**: Automatically update your CRM contacts based on Customer.io segment changes. When a user enters or exits a segment in Customer.io, Pipedream can capture this event to add or update the contact in your CRM, ensuring your sales team always has the latest information.

- **Trigger Email Campaigns Based on Product Usage**: Utilize Pipedream to monitor user interactions with your product (e.g., feature usage or inactivity) from your app's backend or tracking service. Once a specific condition is met, Pipedream triggers a Customer.io workflow that sends out tailored email campaigns to engage or re-engage users.

- **Automate Support Ticket Creation**: When a user expresses dissatisfaction through a survey or a low NPS score in Customer.io, Pipedream can automatically create a support ticket in a tool like Zendesk or Jira. This ensures that your customer support team promptly addresses potential issues and improves customer satisfaction.
