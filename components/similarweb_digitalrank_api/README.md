# Overview

The Similarweb DigitalRank API provides insights into website traffic and engagement, offering metrics like global rank, country rank, and category rank of a domain. With this API on Pipedream, you can automate competitive analysis, monitor changes in website popularity, and integrate web ranking data into your marketing, SEO, or content strategies. Pipedream's serverless platform allows you to create workflows that react to this data in real-time, connecting to other services to act upon these insights.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Competitor Tracking**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever there's a change in the rank of specified competitors. Store this data in a Pipedream data store or send it to a Google Sheet for trend analysis, and receive notifications via Slack or email when significant rank changes occur.

- **SEO Performance Dashboard Updates**: Use the Similarweb DigitalRank API to fetch daily rankings for your own domains, and update a dashboard tool like Geckoboard or Klipfolio. This real-time visibility can help SEO teams to quickly respond to changes in web performance or strategize on content creation.

- **Lead Generation for Sales Teams**: Identify top-ranked websites in certain categories and use this data to generate leads. Combine Similarweb rankings with Clearbit or Hunter to find contact information of key stakeholders at these high-ranking websites, and automatically add them to a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot.
