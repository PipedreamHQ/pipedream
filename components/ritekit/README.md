# Overview

RiteKit API offers a suite of tools to enrich social media engagement. Through Pipedream, you can automate hashtag suggestions, generate images for social posts, and retrieve analytics. This integration can power up your social media strategy by automating tasks like crafting posts with trending hashtags, scheduling content with optimized images, and analyzing performance without manual effort.

# Example Use Cases

- **Auto-Generated Social Media Posts with Trending Hashtags**: Use RiteKit API to get trending hashtags based on your content. Set up a workflow that triggers when you draft a new blog post in your CMS (like WordPress). The API suggests relevant hashtags, which Pipedream adds to your social media posts queued in Buffer or Hootsuite.

- **Enhanced Blog Post Sharing with Auto-Created Images**: When a new article is published on your blog, trigger a workflow that uses the RiteKit API to generate an image with the article's title and author. This image is then automatically tweeted via the Twitter API, making the shared content more engaging and likely to stand out.

- **Social Media Performance Analytics to Google Sheets**: Schedule a daily or weekly Pipedream workflow that calls RiteKit's analytics endpoints for your social media accounts. Aggregate the data and push it to Google Sheets, where you can keep a running log of engagement metrics to inform your content strategy.
