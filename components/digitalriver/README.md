# Overview

The DigitalRiver API lets you manage e-commerce activities like orders, payments, and customer information. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to create automated workflows that integrate with other apps, react to events, process transactions, and handle global e-commerce complexities. Pipedream's serverless platform enables you to build and execute these workflows quickly, without setting up infrastructure, and to connect DigitalRiver with countless other services for a seamless e-commerce ecosystem.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Order Fulfillment**: When a new order is placed in DigitalRiver, trigger a workflow in Pipedream to send order details to a fulfillment service like ShipStation or a custom inventory management system to ensure timely delivery.

- **Sync Customer Data**: After a transaction is completed on DigitalRiver, use Pipedream to sync customer information with a CRM tool like Salesforce or HubSpot, keeping all customer interactions and history up to date for enhanced customer service and targeted marketing.

- **Handle Refunds and Returns**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for DigitalRiver refund events and then processes them automatically, updating accounting records in QuickBooks and notifying customer service teams to handle any follow-up actions required.
