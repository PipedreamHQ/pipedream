# Overview

The Mumara API provides programmatic access to powerful email marketing and SMS campaign tools, allowing for the automation of contact list management, campaign creation, and performance tracking. In Pipedream, you can leverage these capabilities to create custom workflows that integrate Mumara with other services, automate repetitive tasks, and react to events in real-time. By connecting Mumara's API with Pipedream's serverless execution platform, you can create data-driven workflows that streamline your marketing efforts.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Shopify Customers to Mumara Contacts**: Automatically add new customers from your Shopify store to a Mumara contact list. Whenever a new customer is created in Shopify, a Pipedream workflow triggers, adding the customer's details to your specified Mumara list, keeping your marketing campaigns up-to-date with minimal effort.

- **Send Campaign Results to Slack**: Keep your team informed by sending Mumara campaign performance reports directly to a Slack channel. After a campaign's completion, a Pipedream workflow activates, fetching the metrics from Mumara and formatting a message with key results, which is then posted to your team's Slack channel, providing quick insights for decision making.

- **Create Mumara Campaigns from Google Sheets**: Manage your email campaigns directly from a Google Sheet. Set up a Pipedream workflow that monitors changes in a designated Google Sheets document. When campaign details like subject, content, and recipient list are updated, the workflow creates a new email campaign in Mumara with the provided details, turning your Google Sheet into a campaign management tool.
