# Overview

The Zip Archive API allows you to manage zip archives programmatically. You can create, extract, and modify zip files, making it ideal for automating routine file management tasks. Integrating this API with Pipedream enables you to automate workflows that involve file compression or decompression, combine it with triggers from other apps, and process large batches of files efficiently, saving time and reducing manual effort.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Backup and Compression for Cloud Storage**: Automatically zip files uploaded to a Dropbox folder and then store the compressed archive in Google Drive. This can be useful for archiving documents and saving space in cloud storage.

- **Email Attachments Compression**: Monitor an email inbox for new messages with attachments using the Gmail trigger, compress the attachments into a zip file, and upload the archive to a specific FTP server or cloud storage service. This is particularly useful for businesses that regularly receive large attachments and want to streamline storage.

- **Website Asset Management**: Automatically compress website assets like CSS, JS, and images whenever they are updated in a GitHub repository. After compression, the zip archive could be pushed back to another branch within the repo or deployed to a web server. This workflow helps in optimizing the loading speed of web pages.
