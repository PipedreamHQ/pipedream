# Overview

The WebinarGeek API lets you automate and streamline your webinar management tasks. You can create, update, and delete webinars, manage registrations, send out emails, and gather analytics. By harnessing this API within Pipedream, you can construct workflows that react to a variety of triggers, such as new registrant data, and then take actions, like updating a CRM or sending personalized follow-up emails through your email provider.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Webinar Follow-up Emails**: After a webinar ends, trigger a workflow that gathers the list of attendees from WebinarGeek and sends personalized thank-you emails through SendGrid, including a link to the webinar recording.

- **CRM Integration for New Registrants**: When a new user registers for a webinar, automatically add their details to your Salesforce CRM and send them a calendar invite via Google Calendar, ensuring that they're reminded of the event.

- **Real-Time Slack Notifications for Webinar Engagement**: Set up a workflow that sends a notification to a designated Slack channel when someone asks a question during a webinar, enabling real-time engagement and allowing your team to provide immediate answers or follow-ups.
