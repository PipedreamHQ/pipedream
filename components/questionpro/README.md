# Overview

QuestionPro provides a suite of tools to create, distribute, and analyze surveys. Utilizing its API within Pipedream allows you to automate workflows around survey distribution, response collection, and data analysis. You can trigger actions based on new survey responses, generate reports, and integrate survey data with other apps to enrich customer profiles, support decision-making processes, or measure satisfaction levels across various services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Survey Response Processing**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream whenever a new response is submitted to a QuestionPro survey. Use this to update a CRM like Salesforce with customer feedback, or to push the data into a Google Sheet for further analysis.

- **Scheduled Survey Distribution**: Set up a timed workflow in Pipedream that sends out surveys through QuestionPro at regular intervals â€“ daily, weekly, or monthly. Combine this with a mail service like SendGrid to follow up with non-respondents, ensuring a higher response rate.

- **Real-time Feedback Analysis**: Implement a Pipedream workflow that captures new QuestionPro survey responses, analyzes the sentiment using an AI service like MonkeyLearn, and posts a summary to a Slack channel. This can help teams quickly gauge customer sentiment and react promptly to feedback.
