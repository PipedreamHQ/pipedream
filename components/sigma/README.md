# Overview

The Sigma API allows users to automate and integrate their business intelligence directly from Sigma Computing into other services and workflows. Sigma is a powerful tool for creating live, actionable dashboards and reports from cloud data warehouses. With Pipedream, users can harness this capability to trigger workflows based on Sigma events, manipulate and analyze Sigma data, and synchronize insights across other apps, enhancing data-driven decision-making processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automatically Distribute Sigma Reports**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream where Sigma reports are automatically fetched and emailed to stakeholders at regular intervals or in response to specific data changes. This can be integrated with email platforms like SendGrid to streamline communication.

- **Real-time Slack Notifications for Sigma Dashboard Updates**: Create a Pipedream workflow that monitors changes in Sigma dashboards or reports and sends notifications through Slack. This helps teams stay updated on the latest insights without constantly checking Sigma.

- **Sync Sigma Data with Google Sheets for Further Analysis**: Use Pipedream to develop a workflow where data from Sigma is automatically extracted and pushed into Google Sheets. This allows for additional data manipulation or sharing within teams who prefer accessing data through Google Sheets.
