# Overview

The Firefish API allows developers to access and manipulate recruitment data programmatically. It's designed for recruitment agencies seeking to streamline their processes, synchronize their data across platforms, and enhance candidate engagement through automated workflows. With the Firefish API on Pipedream, users can automate tasks such as updating candidate records, managing job postings, and triggering communication based on specific actions or criteria. This integration supports more efficient operations by connecting recruitment activities directly with other apps used in the hiring process.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Candidate Updates**: When a candidate updates their profile or CV in an external system like LinkedIn, use Pipedream to capture that event via webhook, and automatically update their corresponding profile in Firefish. This ensures that candidate data is always current without manual re-entry.

- **Job Posting Alerts**: Automatically create a workflow in Pipedream that detects when a new job is posted in Firefish. Use this trigger to send a custom notification through email or messaging platforms like Slack to relevant recruitment teams. This can help teams respond more quickly to new opportunities, ensuring better candidate placement.

- **Candidate Feedback Collection**: After a candidate interview, automate the feedback collection by using Firefish API to send out emails or SMS through integration with Twilio or SendGrid. Collect the feedback via forms and update the candidate's record in Firefish with the received feedback, streamlining the communication and evaluation process.
