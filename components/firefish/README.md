# Overview

The Firefish API connects recruitment software functionalities with external applications, enabling automation of tasks like candidate management, job posting, and reporting. Users can leverage this API on Pipedream to streamline recruitment processes by automating data synchronization between Firefish and other apps, handling applicant tracking, and generating real-time analytics for decision-making.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Candidate Sourcing**: Trigger workflows on Pipedream when new jobs are posted in Firefish to automatically source candidates from platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed. Utilize candidate data to pre-fill application forms and submit them directly to Firefish.

- **Candidate Status Update Notifications**: Set up a workflow that monitors candidate status changes in Firefish and automatically sends updates via Slack or email to relevant stakeholders. This keeps teams informed in real-time about important developments like interview schedules, candidate evaluations, or hiring decisions.

- **Job Posting Syndication**: When a new job is created in Firefish, automatically syndicate this job across multiple job boards and social media platforms like Monster, Glassdoor, and Twitter to maximize reach and attract diverse applicants. This workflow can also track posting success rate and gather statistics for each platform, feeding back into Firefish for performance analysis.
