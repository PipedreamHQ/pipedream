# Overview

The Firefish API allows users to automate and integrate recruitment processes by connecting their Firefish software with other tools and platforms on Pipedream. This connectivity provides enhanced capabilities in managing candidate data, job postings, and recruitment campaigns efficiently. Users can automate tasks such as syncing candidate information, updating job postings, and triggering communication based on specific triggers in the recruitment pipeline.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Candidate Sourcing**: When a new job is created in Firefish, automatically fetch potential candidates from LinkedIn using their API, and insert these candidates into Firefish. This helps streamline the sourcing process without manually searching for and entering candidate details.

- **Sync Candidate Updates to Google Sheets**: Set up a workflow where any update to a candidateâ€™s status in Firefish triggers a corresponding update in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This is useful for recruiting teams to have real-time visibility of candidate statuses across various recruitment stages without having to log into Firefish.

- **Automated Candidate Feedback Collection via Email**: After an interview is logged in Firefish, automatically send a personalized feedback form via email using the SendGrid API. Collect the feedback, and upon completion, update the candidate's record in Firefish. This ensures timely collection and storage of interview feedback, enhancing the decision-making process.
