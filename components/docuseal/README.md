# Overview

The DocuSeal API enables users to automate the process of sending, signing, and managing documents. With this API, you can create seamless workflows for electronic signatures, ensuring documents are signed accurately and expediently. This API is particularly useful in environments where contract or agreement handling is frequent and critical, such as in legal, real estate, or HR departments.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Distribution Workflow**: Send contracts automatically to new employees or contractors as soon as they are added to your HR system. Once signed, the documents are automatically stored in a secure cloud storage service like Google Drive, and relevant team members are notified via email or Slack.

- **Real-Time Document Status Tracking**: Set up a dashboard using Pipedream's integrated apps to monitor the status of sent documents. Trigger notifications or follow-up actions based on document status changes (e.g., signed, viewed, declined). Useful for sales teams to keep up-to-date with critical deal stages.

- **Client Onboarding Documents Handling**: Automate the sending of onboarding paperwork to new clients when they are added to your CRM system, like Salesforce. After the documents are signed, trigger workflows to update client records in Salesforce and initiate onboarding processes, such as scheduling kick-off calls or sending personalized welcome emails.
