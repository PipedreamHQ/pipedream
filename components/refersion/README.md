# Overview

Refersion is a powerful affiliate tracking platform that streamlines the process of managing, tracking, and growing your affiliate network. Through its API, you can automate affiliate registrations, commission tracking, and payout processes. Pipedream's serverless platform allows you to connect Refersion with 3,000+ other apps to automate workflows, sync data across platforms, and respond to events in real time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Affiliate Performance Reporting to Slack**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever an affiliate generates a sale. Use the Refersion API to retrieve the sale details and then format a message summarizing the affiliate's performance, which is sent to a specified Slack channel. This allows for immediate team updates on affiliate success.

- **Email Drip Campaign for New Affiliates**: When a new affiliate registers through the Refersion API, use Pipedream to add them to a Mailchimp list automatically. Then, trigger a series of welcome and educational emails over the following weeks to engage and inform the new affiliate about maximizing their impact.

- **Affiliate Payout Automation with Stripe**: At the end of each payout period, compile affiliate commissions using the Refersion API and execute a bulk payout with Stripe through Pipedream. This workflow ensures that affiliates are paid in a timely manner, with minimal manual intervention.
