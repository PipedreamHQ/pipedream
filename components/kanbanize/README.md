# Overview

The Kanbanize API enables the automation of complex project management workflows within Kanban boards. By leveraging the API, you can create, update, and move cards, manage board configurations, and integrate real-time updates with other tools. It's a powerful way to streamline project tracking, automate task assignments, and synchronize data across various project management platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Task Assignment**: When a new card reaches a specific column on the Kanbanize board, use Pipedream to automatically assign the task to a team member based on availability or expertise. Notify the assignee via Slack or email.

- **Project Update Synchronizer**: Sync status updates across multiple project management tools. When a card's status changes in Kanbanize, Pipedream can update the corresponding task in tools like Jira, Asana, or Trello, ensuring all platforms reflect the most current information.

- **Time Tracking Integration**: Implement time tracking by triggering a time entry in a service like Toggl or Harvest whenever a card moves to a 'In Progress' column on Kanbanize. Conversely, stop the tracker when the card moves to the 'Done' column.
