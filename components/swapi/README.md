# Overview

The SWAPI (Star Wars API) provides a wealth of data about the Star Wars
universe to build applications. With the SWAPI, developers can access detailed
Star Wars related data about people, planets, films, species and much more.
From web and mobile applications to data analysis, the possibilities are
limitless.

Here are a few examples of what developers can build using the SWAPI:

- Create a Star Wars encyclopedia to document the Star Wars universe and its
  characters.
- Design a custom interactive map to explore the planets of the Star Wars
  universe.
- Analyze the data to uncover patterns and insights about Star Wars films,
  characters, and species.
- Design a search engine to query Star Wars related data.
- Create a mobile app that displays information about the characters, films and
  species in the Star Wars universe.
- Design a live score system specialized in providing stats related to the Star
  Wars films and characters.
