# Overview

The Gladia API offers a suite of AI-powered capabilities, including image recognition, text analysis, and language processing. With its integration on Pipedream, you can build serverless workflows to automate tasks like content moderation, data enrichment, and real-time translations. Leverage Gladia's AI functions within Pipedream to create powerful, event-driven workflows that respond to various triggers such as webhooks, schedules, or app events.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Moderation Pipeline**: Use Gladia's content moderation API on Pipedream to scan user-submitted images for inappropriate content. When an image is uploaded to your platform, trigger a workflow that passes the image to Gladia for analysis, and based on the results, automatically flag or remove the image, notify moderators, or take other appropriate actions.

- **Sentiment Analysis Feedback Loop**: Analyze customer feedback by connecting Gladia's sentiment analysis to support ticket submissions. When a new ticket is created in a helpdesk app like Zendesk, trigger a Pipedream workflow that uses Gladia to assess the sentiment of the submission. Use this data to prioritize urgent negative feedback and route tickets to the right team, or to gather insights on customer satisfaction over time.

- **Multilingual Chatbot Enhancer**: Enhance a chatbot's multilingual capabilities by integrating Gladia's language translation API into a Pipedream workflow. As messages come in from users speaking various languages, the workflow can translate them into a preferred language for the support team, and vice versa, ensuring clear communication and broadening the chatbot's audience reach.
