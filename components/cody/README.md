# Overview

The Cody API provides a platform for coaches and creators to manage their fitness business, allowing them to create content, interact with clients, schedule sessions, and track client progress. In Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate various aspects of your coaching business. You could, for instance, trigger workflows when new content is published, when clients schedule sessions, or when progress is logged. Integrating Cody with other apps in Pipedream allows you to build custom automation that saves time and provides insights at a glance.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Published Notification**: When a new piece of content is published on Cody, a Pipedream workflow could automatically send notifications to all your clients via Slack or email, ensuring they're immediately aware of the new material available for them.

- **Session Scheduler Sync**: Sync Cody's session scheduler with Google Calendar using Pipedream. Whenever a client books a session, a corresponding event could be created in a Google Calendar, giving you an integrated view of your schedule across platforms.

- **Client Progress Tracker**: Each time a client updates their progress in Cody, a Pipedream workflow could log this information in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This creates a historical data record, making it easier to monitor client progress over time and adjust programs as needed.
