# Overview

The AnonyFlow API provides a way to manage and automate data privacy operations. Use it on Pipedream to orchestrate data anonymization workflows for compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR. This API can handle personal data extraction, anonymization, and deletion requests programmatically. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can integrate these privacy functions into your existing systems, triggering actions based on webhooks, schedules, or other apps' events.

# Example Use Cases

- **User Data Anonymization Workflow**: When a user requests their data to be anonymized, a Pipedream workflow can catch this event, send the user's data to AnonyFlow for anonymization, and then update the user's records in your database via a direct database integration or through an app like Airtable.

- **Scheduled Data Privacy Audit**: Automate regular privacy audits by scheduling a Pipedream workflow that retrieves user data from your app, sends it to AnonyFlow for a privacy check, and receives a report. Integrate with Slack to notify your team if any issues arise, maintaining ongoing compliance.

- **Right to be Forgotten Compliance**: On receiving a deletion request, trigger a Pipedream workflow that uses AnonyFlow to delete the userâ€™s personal data. Follow up by logging the action in a compliance app like Smartsheet or posting a confirmation message to a private admin channel in Discord.
