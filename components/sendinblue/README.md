# Overview

The SendinBlue API offers a suite of email marketing tools, including campaign creation, contact list management, and transactional email sending. It's designed for crafting personalized messages, automating marketing workflows, and tracking the performance of email campaigns. With Pipedream, you can harness the power of SendinBlue by automating interactions with other services, reacting to events with custom code, and stitching together complex workflows with minimal effort.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Welcome Email Series**: When a new user signs up for your service, trigger a Pipedream workflow that adds them to a SendinBlue contact list and starts a drip email campaign to onboard them smoothly.

- **Support Ticket Follow-Up Surveys**: After a support ticket is marked resolved in your helpdesk software, use Pipedream to send a follow-up survey via SendinBlue to gauge customer satisfaction and collect feedback for service improvement.

- **Event-Triggered Promotions**: Combine SendinBlue with your e-commerce platform. When a customer makes a purchase, or an item goes on sale, Pipedream can kick off a targeted email campaign, offering relevant products, discounts, or loyalty rewards.
