# Overview

Listclean API provides a straightforward way to validate and clean your email lists.

This ensures that you're only sending emails to addresses that are active and valid, improving your campaign's success rate and preserving your sender reputation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Validate Emails on User Sign-up**: When a new user signs up on your platform, you can automatically validate their email address with Listclean to ensure it's a legitimate address. This can be paired with a user management platform like Auth0 to streamline account creation.

- **Clean Marketing Lists Before Campaigns**: Before launching an email marketing campaign, use Listclean in a Pipedream workflow to scrub your email list. This can be effectively combined with marketing tools like Mailchimp or SendGrid to ensure high deliverability and engagement rates.

- **Periodic Cleaning of Database Emails**: Set up a recurring Pipedream workflow that periodically validates all email addresses stored in your database. This can be integrated with database services like PostgreSQL or MySQL, maintaining the hygiene of your contact data over time.
