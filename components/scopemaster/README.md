# Overview

The ScopeMaster API is an API designed for developers who want to create
automated processes for web testing. With this API, developers can automate the
analysis of page performance for website analytics and quality assurance. With
this tool, developers can test multiple aspects of their website, from page
performance to accessibility, as well as quality assurance and scalability.

The ScopeMaster API offers powerful automated web testing features that help
ensure quality across the web. It can be used to create custom page tests for
page performance, accessibility, scalability, security, and other aspects.
Developers can customize the tests to match their specific website requirements
and track website performance in real time.

Here are some examples of what you can build using the ScopeMaster API:

- An automated web performance monitoring platform that refreshes and updates
  data quickly.
- A performance analysis platform that tests multiple aspects of a website,
  including page loading times and other vital metrics.
- A scalability testing platform that can detect potential problems before they
  arise and provide insights to developers on ways to improve scalability.
- A quality assurance platform that automatically performs tests on webpages
  and helps ensure that webpages are up-to-date and secure.
- A tool for accessibility testing to ensure webpages are accessible to all
  users.
- A platform for stress testing that allows developers to monitor and analyze
  the performance of websites under high load conditions.
