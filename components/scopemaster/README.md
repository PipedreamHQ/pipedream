# Overview

The ScopeMaster API provides capabilities to automate and streamline software requirements analysis. It automatically interprets user needs from a functional size perspective, helping teams to better understand and manage software scope, which can greatly improve project planning and accuracy. By integrating ScopeMaster with Pipedream, you can automatically trigger actions based on requirement changes, align software development tasks with project management tools, or even enhance continuous integration and deployment workflows by including requirements validation steps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Requirements Validation on GitHub Push**: Each time a developer pushes updates to a GitHub repository, trigger a ScopeMaster analysis to validate the updated software requirements. If discrepancies or ambiguities are detected, automatically create an issue in GitHub to prompt review and resolution.

- **Syncing Analysis Results with Project Management Tools**: After performing a requirements analysis using ScopeMaster, automatically post the results to a project management tool like Jira or Trello. This can include creating tasks for each requirement that needs attention or updating existing cards with new insights, ensuring that the project scope is accurately reflected and tracked.

- **Continuous Deployment Integration**: Integrate ScopeMaster analysis into a CI/CD pipeline using Pipedream. Before deployment, trigger an analysis of requirements to ensure they are complete and unambiguous. Use the analysis results to conditionally proceed with the deployment or halt it, notifying the team via Slack or Microsoft Teams to address any critical issues first.
