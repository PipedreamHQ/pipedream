# Overview

GetResponse API integrates email marketing and online campaign management tools into your applications for creating and managing mailing lists, newsletters, automated campaigns, and more. With Pipedream, this functionality expands, allowing you to automate workflows between GetResponse and various apps. Integration can trigger actions like updating contacts, processing event-driven emails, or syncing subscriber lists across platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Shopify Customers to GetResponse Contacts**: Whenever a new customer is added in Shopify, trigger a Pipedream workflow to automatically add that customer to a specified GetResponse contact list. This ensures your email marketing targets all recent customers without manual intervention.

- **Email Campaign Responses to Slack Notifications**: Configure a workflow that listens for specific responses or campaign events from GetResponse, and posts a notification to a designated Slack channel. This allows your marketing team to get real-time feedback and engage quickly with the campaign's performance.

- **Automated Lead Scoring with Google Sheets**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that receives new subscriber notifications from GetResponse, cross-references with engagement data on Google Sheets to assign lead scores, and updates the contact's custom field in GetResponse with the calculated score. This empowers more tailored and effective follow-up communications.
