# Overview

With Launch Darkly, you can easily and quickly add feature flags to your applications. This is particularly useful when you want to test out a new feature with a small group of users first, or when you want to slowly rollout a new feature to all of your users.

Launch Darkly also has an Oauth API, which allows you to easily add feature flags to your applications using Oauth. This is particularly useful when you want to test out a new feature with a small group of users first, or when you want to slowly rollout a new feature to all of your users.

Some examples of what you can build with the Launch Darkly Oauth API include:

- A feature flag management system

- A system for easily rolling out new features to a small group of users

- A system for slowly rolling out new features to all users
