# Overview

Scale AI offers an API to automate and streamline data labeling for machine learning applications, providing access to a global workforce and sophisticated tools. With Scale AI's API on Pipedream, you can integrate scalable data annotation workflows directly into your apps. Trigger tasks, manage datasets, and receive annotated data, all within Pipedream's serverless platform. This enables seamless automation of labeling tasks, integration with machine learning pipelines, and real-time updates on annotations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Image Labeling Pipeline**: Trigger Scale AI tasks for image labeling whenever new images are uploaded to an S3 bucket. Use AWS S3 trigger to start the workflow on Pipedream, process images with Scale AI, and finally store labeled data back in S3 or send it to a database.

- **Real-time Data Annotation Monitoring**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for Scale AI webhook events. Process these events to monitor the progress of data annotation tasks in real-time. You could further integrate this with Slack or email to notify your team as tasks are completed or reviewed.

- **Sentiment Analysis Feedback Loop**: Use Scale AI for sentiment analysis on user-submitted text. Start with a trigger from a database or a web form on Pipedream. Send the text to Scale AI for sentiment analysis, and then use the results to update user profiles, or route the feedback to the correct team within your organization.
