# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Ticket Creation**: Automate the creation of support tickets in a system like Zendesk or Jira whenever a customer raises an issue via a Chatforma-powered chatbot. This ensures that customer inquiries are logged correctly and can be tracked for timely resolution.

- **Feedback Collection and Analysis**: After a chatbot interaction, use Chatforma to prompt for customer feedback and push the responses to a Google Sheet or Airtable base. Combine this with sentiment analysis tools like Google’s Natural Language API to gauge customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.

- **E-Commerce Order Updates**: Integrate Chatforma with Shopify or WooCommerce to notify customers about order updates. When an order status changes, trigger a chatbot message with the updated status, providing timely and personalized updates directly through the chat interface.
