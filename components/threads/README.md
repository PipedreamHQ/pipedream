# Overview

The Threads API on Pipedream enables you to automate your team's communication in Threads.com, a platform designed to make work discussions more organized and accessible. By integrating the API with Pipedream, you can create workflows to streamline notifications, manage discussions, and sync information across multiple services without writing complex code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Status Updates**: Set up a workflow that triggers a new thread in Threads.com whenever a new task is marked as complete in your project management tool, like Trello or Asana. This keeps everyone in the loop with the latest project developments.

- **Customer Feedback Collection**: Use a workflow that starts when a customer submits feedback through a form, like Typeform or Google Forms. Automatically share this feedback in a designated Threads.com space, ensuring that the right team members can take action and discuss next steps.

- **Event-Driven Notifications**: Create a workflow that posts to Threads.com when specific events occur in your apps. For example, when a new sale is made in Shopify, a message could be posted to a sales discussion thread, alerting the team about the success and details of the transaction.
