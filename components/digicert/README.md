# Overview

The DigiCert API provides a programmatic interface to manage the lifecycle of SSL/TLS certificates, offering automation for tasks such as ordering, reissuing, and renewing certificates. Using Pipedream, you can harness this API to create powerful workflows that enhance your certificate management process, ensuring security compliance, automating routine tasks, and integrating with other services, like monitoring systems or deployment pipelines.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Certificate Renewal Notifications**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that periodically checks the expiration status of your SSL/TLS certificates through the DigiCert API. If a certificate is nearing its expiry date, automatically send renewal reminders via email or push notifications to your team with apps like Gmail or Slack integrated into the workflow.

- **Provisioning Certificates for New Domains**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for events from a domain management system or triggers when a new domain is registered. Use DigiCert API to automatically issue certificates for these new domains and, optionally, deploy them to your servers via SSH or integrate with infrastructure as code tools like Terraform to update your configurations.

- **Incident Response for Certificate Errors**: Construct a Pipedream workflow that monitors your siteâ€™s certificate health by integrating with uptime monitoring services like UptimeRobot. On detecting SSL errors, trigger the workflow to automatically reissue or renew certificates with the DigiCert API, and then alert your DevOps team through channels like PagerDuty or Opsgenie.
