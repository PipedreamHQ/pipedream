# Overview

With the DigiCert API, you can programmatically request and renew SSL/TLS
certificates, automate certificate provisioning for your systems and web
servers, and monitor certificate inventory and expiration dates.

- A tool to automatically request and renew SSL/TLS certificates for your web
  servers
- A system to track your organization's SSL/TLS certificate inventory and
  expiration dates
