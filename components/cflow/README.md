# Overview

The Cflow API lets you automate and integrate your workflow management, enhancing your business processes with custom automations. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to create, update, and track workflows without manual interference. This enables you to connect Cflow with various other apps and services, streamlining your processes from initiation to completion.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Document Approval Workflows**: Trigger a Cflow workflow for document approvals when a new file is added to Google Drive. Use Pipedream to listen for new files on Drive, then automatically start an approval process in Cflow, ensuring no document goes unchecked.

- **Sync HR Requests with Slack**: Integrate Cflow with Slack to notify team channels when new HR requests are submitted. When an employee submits a request in Cflow, Pipedream can post a message with details to a designated Slack channel, keeping everyone in the loop.

- **Consolidate Sales Leads**: Combine Cflow with a CRM like Salesforce. Whenever a new sales lead is captured in Cflow, use Pipedream to automatically create or update the lead in Salesforce, ensuring your sales team has the most up-to-date information at their fingertips.
