# Overview

The EverWebinar API lets you integrate the power of automated webinar marketing into your own apps and workflows. With EverWebinar, you can schedule and run automated webinars as if they were live, engaging audiences with interactive elements such as polls and chat simulations. Using Pipedream, you can trigger actions based on webinar events, sync participant data with other platforms, and automate follow-up communications, providing a seamless bridge between your webinar activities and other business processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Webinar Registrant Follow-Up**: Automate the process of following up with registrants post-webinar by creating a workflow that triggers an email sequence with additional resources or a survey link when a participant attends or misses a webinar.

- **CRM Integration for Lead Tracking**: Keep your customer relationship management (CRM) system up to date by using a Pipedream workflow to add or update contacts with details from EverWebinar registrants, tracking their interactions and engagement level across your marketing funnel.

- **Social Media Engagement Post-Webinar**: Increase engagement by automatically posting on your social media platforms thanking participants after a webinar ends. Set up a Pipedream workflow to tweet or share a message on LinkedIn with a call to action or a teaser for the next event.
