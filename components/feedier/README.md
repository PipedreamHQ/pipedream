# Overview

The [Feedier API](https://feedier.com) lets you harness the power of customer feedback by automating the collection and analysis process. With this API, you can create, retrieve, update, and delete feedback, along with managing carriers and rewards. It enables you to streamline the feedback loop, integrate with your CRM, and trigger actions based on customer responses. Pipedream's serverless platform opens up a world of possibilities for integrating Feedier with 3,000+ other apps to automate workflows, analyze data, and respond in real-time to customer insights.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Feedback Collection to CRM**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow when a new feedback is submitted in Feedier. Use this data to create or update a customer profile in a CRM like Salesforce, ensuring that the latest customer feedback is always at your sales team's fingertips.

- **Dynamic Reward Distribution**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for high scores in feedback submissions. When a customer gives a high rating, automatically send them a reward or discount code via email using a service like SendGrid, to thank them for their input and encourage loyalty.

- **Sentiment Analysis for Real-time Alerts**: Use Pipedream to pipe new feedback from Feedier into a sentiment analysis tool like MonkeyLearn. If negative sentiment is detected, trigger an alert in a team communication app like Slack or Microsoft Teams to prompt immediate action from customer support.
