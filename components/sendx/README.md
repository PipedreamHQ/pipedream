# Overview

The SendX API offers a toolbox for email marketing automation, allowing developers to integrate SendX's capabilities into Pipedream workflows seamlessly. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to trigger actions based on various conditions, synchronize data across platforms, automate email campaigns, and personalize interactions with your subscribers. The power of Pipedream lies in its ability to connect the dots between SendX and numerous other apps, creating a cohesive automation ecosystem.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync SendX Contacts with CRM**: Keep your CRM contacts in sync with your SendX subscribers. Whenever a new subscriber is added to SendX, automatically add them to your CRM platform, like Salesforce or HubSpot, ensuring all customer touchpoints remain updated.

- **Automate Welcome Email Series**: Trigger a sequence of welcome emails through SendX when a user signs up on your website. Use Pipedream's HTTP trigger to initiate the workflow, enhancing subscriber engagement right from the start without manual intervention.

- **Aggregate Subscription Analytics**: Collect and send subscription metrics from SendX to a data visualization tool like Google Sheets or Tableau. Set up a scheduled Pipedream workflow to fetch data periodically and represent your email campaign performance comprehensively.
