# Overview

The Meetup API allows developers to create applications that make use of the
vast array of groups and events hosted on the Meetup website. Some examples of
what you can build using the Meetup API include:

- A widget that displays upcoming events for a particular group
- A map application that shows meetup groups in a particular area
- A social networking application that helps users find groups and events based
  on their interests
