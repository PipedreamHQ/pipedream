# Overview

The Path of Exile API offers a trove of in-game information, from player stats to item data. Using Pipedream, you can automate interactions with the API to monitor game updates, track item prices, automate notifications for trades, and integrate with other services for analytics or enhanced gameplay experiences.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Trade Offers Notifications**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that polls the Path of Exile trade API for items you're interested in. When a new listing meets your criteria, automatically send a notification via Discord or Slack, ensuring you never miss out on a critical trade.

- **League Stat Tracking**: Create a Pipedream workflow that retrieves your character's league stats at regular intervals. Log this data into Google Sheets or Airtable to analyze your gameplay over time or share your progress with friends or your gaming community.

- **Price Watcher for Rare Items**: Monitor the market for rare items with a Pipedream workflow. When the price drops below a threshold you set, trigger an alert through SMS or email. Connect this workflow with a database like MongoDB to track historical price data for deeper market insights.
