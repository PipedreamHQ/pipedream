# Overview

The Sentry API on Pipedream allows you to automate error tracking and responses in your applications. Sentry's robust issue tracking and release monitoring align with Pipedream's ability to craft custom workflows, enabling developers to connect error alerts to a plethora of other services for notifications, analysis, task management, and more. With Sentry's detailed diagnostic data, these workflows can help reduce downtime by triggering quick actions upon issue detection.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Issue Alerting**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream when Sentry reports a new issue or an increase in issue frequency. Use this to send real-time notifications through Slack, SMS via Twilio, or email through SendGrid to alert your development team immediately.

- **Issue Management Integration**: Capture new Sentry issues and create corresponding tickets in project management tools like Jira or Trello. Enrich the tickets with stack traces, last occurrences, and user impact data from Sentry, ensuring the team has all the necessary context to tackle the problem.

- **Performance Metric Reporting**: Generate periodic reports on performance metrics and error trends using Sentry's API. Feed this data into a Google Sheets document or a dashboard tool like Data Studio for visualization, enabling your team to analyze and respond to application performance insights over time.
