# Overview

The Close API provides access to a robust CRM platform, enabling users to automate sales processes, manage leads, and track communication history. Harnessing the Close API within Pipedream's ecosystem allows for the creation of custom, serverless workflows that can react in real-time to events, synchronize data across apps, and streamline sales operations. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can trigger actions based on Close events, manipulate Close data, and integrate with countless other services to amplify your CRM's functionality.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Scoring Automation**: Automatically score leads in Close based on interaction data from multiple touchpoints. For instance, increase a lead's score when they open an email, attend a webinar, or visit your pricing page, pushing high-scoring leads to your sales team for immediate action.

- **Email Campaign Follow-up**: Create a workflow that listens for a status change on a lead in Close, triggering a personalized follow-up email sequence via apps like SendGrid or Mailchimp when a lead enters a specific status, ensuring timely engagement and nurturing of potential customers.

- **Support Ticket Creation**: When a Close lead sends a distress signal, like a negative email reply or a support request, trigger a workflow that creates a support ticket in a tool like Zendesk or Jira Service Management, helping your support team prioritize and respond rapidly to critical issues.
