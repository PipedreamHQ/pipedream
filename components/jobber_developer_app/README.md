# Overview

The Jobber (Developer App) API enables the automation of tasks within Jobber, a platform designed for home service businesses. It allows for the management and syncing of client information, job scheduling, invoicing, and more through programmatic means. On Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create serverless workflows that integrate Jobber with other apps and services, streamlining operations and improving efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Client Sync Workflow**: Create a workflow that triggers whenever a new client is added in Jobber. The client's details are automatically synced to a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot, ensuring all customer information is consistent and up-to-date across platforms.

- **Automated Invoice Reminders**: Set up a workflow that listens for job completion events in Jobber, then automatically generates and sends an invoice to the client via email. If the invoice remains unpaid after a certain period, trigger follow-up reminders to encourage prompt payment.

- **Job Scheduling Alerts**: Implement a workflow where new jobs scheduled in Jobber trigger notifications to staff members via Slack or SMS. This helps keep the team informed and ready for upcoming tasks, improving responsiveness and coordination.
