# Overview

The DeskTime API enables you to hook into vital data concerning productivity tracking, employee attendance, and project management. Integrating this API with Pipedream allows you to automate workflows, synchronize productivity data with other tools, and trigger actions based on team performance metrics. For instance, you can set up a system that notifies a project manager when an employee logs overtime or integrates time tracking data with payroll software.

# Example Use Cases

- **Time-Tracking Alerts**: Automatically send a Slack message to a project manager when an employee's tracked time exceeds a certain threshold for the day, indicating potential overtime or excessive workload.

- **Attendance Reports**: Generate and send daily attendance reports to HR by compiling employee check-in and check-out times from DeskTime, then emailing the report using a service like SendGrid or directly through Gmail.

- **Project Hours and Invoicing**: Connect DeskTime with a billing platform like QuickBooks to create invoices based on the number of hours tracked on specific projects, ensuring accurate and timely billing for clients.
