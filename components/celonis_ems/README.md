# Overview

The Celonis EMS API allows you to harness the power of process mining and execution management within your workflows. Integrated within Pipedream, this API enables you to automate actions based on process insights, such as identifying bottlenecks and initiating corrective measures. You can trigger workflows from Celonis data, send data back into Celonis for deeper analysis, or even mix data from different sources for rich, actionable insights.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Ticket Creation in Jira based on Process Findings**: When Celonis identifies a deviation or inefficiency in a process, like longer lead times in procurement, a Pipedream workflow can automatically create a ticket in Jira to address the issue, ensuring timely resolution and continuous process optimization.

- **Sync Process Analytics with Google Sheets**: Regularly export key process metrics from Celonis to a Google Sheet for reporting and analysis. This could include data like process cycle times or compliance rates, allowing for a more accessible view for stakeholders who prefer quick looks over spreadsheets.

- **Slack Alerts for Critical Process Changes**: Set up a workflow that listens for critical event changes within Celonis, such as a drop in supplier performance or an increase in operational risk, and instantaneously sends a message to a designated Slack channel to alert the relevant team members for immediate action.
