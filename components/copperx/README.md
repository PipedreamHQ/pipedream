# Overview

The Copperx API offers a suite of tools for cryptocurrency trading, providing users with real-time access to market data, order execution, and account management. Integrating this API into Pipedream allows for the creation of custom, serverless workflows that can automate trading strategies, alert users to market changes, and manage portfolios efficiently without manual intervention. By leveraging Pipedream's ability to connect to 3,000+ apps, users can develop robust, event-driven automations that respond to market conditions or other external signals.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Trading System**: Build a workflow that triggers a trade on Copperx based on specific market conditions. For example, if a cryptocurrency hits a certain price, the workflow can execute a buy or sell order, then log the transaction in a Google Sheet.

- **Real-time Alerts**: Use the Copperx API to monitor the market for certain events, such as drastic price changes or volume spikes. When such an event occurs, Pipedream can send an immediate alert through services like Slack, SMS, or email, allowing you to make timely decisions.

- **Portfolio Rebalancing**: Create a recurring workflow in Pipedream that checks your cryptocurrency portfolio on Copperx at regular intervals. If the portfolio drifts from your desired asset allocation, the workflow can execute trades to rebalance the portfolio back to the target allocations.
