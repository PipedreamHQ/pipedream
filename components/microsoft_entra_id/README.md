# Overview

The Microsoft Entra ID API offers a modern identity and access management solution, enabling developers to automate and integrate a broad range of user and identity-related operations. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to create workflows that manage user identities, automate provisioning and deprovisioning, secure access to applications, and more. Pipedream's serverless platform simplifies the process of connecting the Microsoft Entra ID API with hundreds of other apps to build powerful automations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Users to HR Management System**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that triggers when a new user is added in Entra ID, then syncs this user's details to your HR management system, ensuring your employee records are always up-to-date.

- **Automate User Offboarding**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for deactivation events in Entra ID, triggering an offboarding process that revokes access, archives user data, and notifies relevant departments, all in a coordinated and timely manner.

- **Periodic Access Review Reminders**: Build a workflow that periodically checks for users with privileged roles in Entra ID and triggers an access review process by sending reminders via email or messaging apps, helping maintain compliance and minimize security risks.
