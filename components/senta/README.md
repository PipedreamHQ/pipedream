# Overview

The Senta API allows you to automate and integrate practice management tasks within the Senta platform. Leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can create workflows that streamline client onboarding, automate communication, task management, and synchronize data with other services. With Pipedream's serverless platform, these workflows can be triggered by various events, such as incoming emails, schedule timings, or actions from other apps, offering a seamless way to enhance your practice management operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Client Onboarding Automation**: When a new client fills out a form on your website, trigger a Pipedream workflow to create a new client record in Senta. Then, automatically assign tasks to your team for the onboarding process, and send a welcome email to the client with all necessary information to start the engagement.

- **Task Scheduling and Reminder System**: Use Pipedream to set up a workflow that connects with your Google Calendar. When a new task is assigned to a team member in Senta, it automatically creates a corresponding event in Google Calendar and sets reminders. This ensures that deadlines are met and tasks are completed on time.

- **Invoice Management and Follow-ups**: Connect Senta to Xero or another accounting app available on Pipedream. When an invoice is due in Senta, automatically generate the invoice in the accounting software. If the invoice remains unpaid past its due date, the workflow can trigger follow-up emails to the client, ensuring timely payments.
