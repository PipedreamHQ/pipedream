# Overview

The Microsoft Excel API on Pipedream enables you to automate interactions with Excel workbooks in the cloud. With this API, you can read and modify Excel files, manage rows and columns, calculate formulas, and make updates in real-timeâ€”all within serverless workflows on Pipedream. This powerful integration can be a game changer for data analysis, report generation, and dynamic content management, streamlining processes that once took hours into seamless automations.

## Example Use Cases

- **Automated Report Generation**
  Create a workflow that triggers daily, automatically pulling the latest sales data from a database or app, such as Salesforce. Insert the data into an Excel workbook, run calculations, and email the updated report to stakeholders using the SendGrid app on Pipedream.

- **Real-Time Inventory Tracking**
  Set up a workflow that reacts to a new purchase order in an e-commerce platform like Shopify. The workflow updates the relevant inventory levels in an Excel sheet and, if a threshold is reached, sends a restock notification to a Slack channel directly from Pipedream.

- **Survey Data Aggregation**
  After a survey submission on Typeform, use a workflow to capture the response data and append it to an Excel workbook. Analyze the responses or apply transformations, then sync the enriched data to a CRM platform like HubSpot for further processing or lead scoring.
