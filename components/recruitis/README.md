# Overview

The Recruitis API is a tool designed to streamline the recruitment process by allowing developers to automate and integrate different parts of the recruitment workflow. Using Pipedream, you could leverage the Recruitis API to create custom serverless workflows, connecting various apps and services to automate tasks such as candidate screening, interview scheduling, feedback collection, and more. Pipedream’s capability to trigger workflows on specific events, and to connect with numerous other apps, makes it particularly suited for enhancing the efficiency of recruitment processes with the Recruitis API.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Candidate Screening**: Automatically screen candidates as soon as they apply. Connect the Recruitis API to filter applications based on custom criteria (e.g., skills, experience, location). Qualified candidates can be moved to the next stage in the pipeline, while others receive a polite rejection email via an Email Service Provider like SendGrid.

- **Interview Scheduling**: Streamline the scheduling process by connecting the Recruitis API with Google Calendar. When a candidate passes the screening stage, trigger a workflow that checks the hiring team’s availability and sends a calendar invite to both the interviewers and the candidate, ensuring no double bookings happen.

- **Candidate Feedback Aggregation**: After interviews, collect feedback efficiently by connecting the Recruitis API to a form tool like Typeform. Trigger a workflow to send out a feedback form to interviewers. Once feedback is collected, aggregate the responses and update the candidate's status in the Recruitis system, keeping everyone in the loop automatically.
