# Overview

The PingOne API provides identity management solutions that streamline user experiences through Single Sign-On (SSO), multi-factor authentication, and user management. Leveraging this API on Pipedream, developers can automate identity-centric processes, enhance security protocols, and integrate seamlessly with other services. This API becomes particularly powerful when used to auto-sync user data across platforms, manage user access in real-time, and automate responses to security events.

# Example Use Cases

- **User Provisioning and Deprovisioning Automation**: Automatically manage user lifecycles by provisioning or deprovisioning users in PingOne based on events in HR systems like BambooHR or Workday. When a new employee is added in the HR system, a Pipedream workflow triggers the creation of a new user identity in PingOne, assigning appropriate permissions and roles. Conversely, when an employee leaves, their access is revoked, enhancing security.

- **Dynamic Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) Enforcement**: Use PingOne for conditional MFA enforcement based on user activity logs from services like Slack or GitHub. If abnormal activity (like accessing from a new device or location) is detected, a workflow can trigger PingOne to require additional authentication steps for those users, ensuring an extra layer of security.

- **Real-Time Security Alerts and Actions**: Integrate PingOne with monitoring tools like Datadog to receive real-time alerts on security issues. For instance, if an anomaly or breach is detected, a Pipedream workflow can automatically trigger lockdown procedures or alert administrators via communication apps like Slack, streamlining the response to potential threats.
