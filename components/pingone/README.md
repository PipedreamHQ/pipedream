# Overview

The PingOne API provides robust solutions for identity and access management, allowing developers to integrate secure user authentication, profile management, and advanced authorization processes into their apps. With PingOne, you can manage user identities from various sources and ensure secure access to applications, all through a cloud-based platform. Using Pipedream, these capabilities can be extended to create automated workflows that interact with other apps, handling everything from user onboarding to real-time security alerts.

# Example Use Cases

- **User Onboarding Automation**: When a new employee is added to an HR system like BambooHR, automatically create a new user account in PingOne. This helps in streamlining the onboarding process by ensuring that new employees have immediate access to necessary applications.

- **Real-time Security Notification**: Trigger an alert in Slack whenever there is a failed login attempt detected by PingOne. This workflow can help IT security teams quickly respond to potential security threats by providing instant notifications about suspicious activities.

- **Automated Access Revocation**: Automatically revoke access for users in PingOne when they are marked as 'inactive' or 'terminated' in a connected CRM system like Salesforce. This ensures that only current and active users can access company resources, enhancing security compliance.
