# Overview

The Cascade Strategy API unlocks the potential to automate and integrate strategic planning processes directly within Pipedream. By accessing Cascade’s features through the API, you can seamlessly connect strategic goals, track progress, manage tasks, and align your organization’s efforts with its vision. This enables creating dynamic workflows that react to changes in strategy execution, report on key performance indicators, or synchronize organizational goals across multiple platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Strategy Reporting**: Set up a workflow that triggers at regular intervals, pulling data from Cascade to create a comprehensive report of strategic goal progress, which is then sent to stakeholders via email or a messaging app like Slack.

- **Task Synchronization with Project Management Tools**: Whenever a new task is created or updated in Cascade, trigger a workflow to create or update corresponding tasks in a project management tool like Trello or Asana, ensuring cross-platform alignment of strategic tasks.

- **Real-time Alerts for Goal Achievement**: Build a workflow that monitors specific strategic goals within Cascade, and when a goal is achieved or its status changes, send real-time notifications to a team’s communication platform like Microsoft Teams, celebrating the wins and keeping everyone informed.
