# Overview

The BugBug API lets you automate and integrate your browser testing workflows. With it, you can manage tests, run them programmatically, and receive test results. By connecting the BugBug API with Pipedream, you can craft serverless workflows that trigger on various events, enabling a seamless CI/CD integration, or alerting you when your automated tests detect issues.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Test Execution After Deployment:** Trigger a suite of browser tests on BugBug whenever a new version of your app is deployed. Connect this to your CI/CD pipeline using a platform like GitHub Actions, and post the test results back to your GitHub commit or PR for a streamlined review process.

- **Scheduled Browser Test Runs:** Set up a Pipedream cron job to run your BugBug tests at regular intervals. This ensures your website remains in top shape by catching bugs early. If a test fails, automatically send alerts through Slack or email to notify your team instantly.

- **Test Management Upon Issue Tracking:** Integrate BugBug with an issue tracking system like Jira. When a new issue is created that requires browser testing, trigger a specific test in BugBug and upon completion, update the issue with the test results, ensuring all relevant data is captured in your issue tracking system.
