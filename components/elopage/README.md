# Overview

The elopage API allows you to automate processes around selling digital products, courses, memberships, and tickets. It provides endpoints to manage products, payments, users, and subscriptions. With Pipedream's serverless workflows, you can construct automations that respond to elopage events or orchestrate complex tasks involving multiple systems, streamlining your digital commerce operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Onboarding**: Trigger a workflow when a new purchase is made on elopage. The Pipedream workflow can then enroll the customer in an email marketing campaign, send personalized welcome messages, and unlock access to digital content or courses within your system.

- **Real-Time Sales Notifications**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for successful transactions on elopage. Whenever a sale occurs, post a real-time notification to a Slack channel or send an SMS via Twilio, keeping your team informed about new business wins.

- **Subscription Management and Analytics**: Implement a workflow that monitors subscription changes, such as renewals and cancellations, on elopage. Connect this data to a Google Sheets or a dashboard app like Geckoboard, providing up-to-date analytics and insights into recurring revenue and customer churn.
