# Overview

Jellyreach API lets you automate your marketing campaigns by triggering personalized emails, SMS, and push notifications based on various customer actions or data. Integrating Jellyreach with Pipedream's serverless platform allows seamless connectivity between Jellyreach and other services, enabling sophisticated multi-channel communication strategies that can be tailored on-the-fly to suit an array of business needs.

# Example Use Cases

- **User Onboarding Automation**: Automatically send personalized welcome emails via Jellyreach when a new user signs up on your platform. Detect new sign-ups using a webhook or by polling a user database, then use Pipedream to pass the user's information to Jellyreach's API to dispatch the email.

- **E-commerce Cart Abandonment Recovery**: Re-engage customers who've left items in their shopping cart. By integrating Jellyreach with an e-commerce platform like Shopify, you can monitor cart abandonment, and trigger targeted emails or SMS messages nudging customers to complete their purchase.

- **Event-Driven Notification System**: Create an event-based communication system that sends updates through Jellyreach when specific triggers occur. For example, set up a workflow that listens for Stripe payment events and sends a confirmation email or SMS when a payment is successful.
