# Overview

The Invoice Ninja API lets you create, view, update, and delete elements of your invoicing process such as invoices, clients, payments, and products. Leveraging this API on Pipedream allows you to automate invoice generation, synchronize client data across platforms, and trigger actions based on payment statuses. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can connect Invoice Ninja to numerous apps and orchestrate workflows that save time, reduce errors, and enhance data consistency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Generation from CRM Deals**: When a deal is marked as won in a CRM like Salesforce, trigger a workflow to automatically create an invoice in Invoice Ninja with the deal details. This ensures timely billing and reduces manual data entry.

- **Payment Status Sync to Accounting Software**: Whenever a payment is recorded in Invoice Ninja, use Pipedream to update the payment status in accounting software like QuickBooks. This keeps financial records up to date without manual intervention.

- **Slack Notifications for Overdue Invoices**: Set up a scheduled workflow to check for overdue invoices in Invoice Ninja and send alert messages to a designated Slack channel. This helps in prompt follow-up for payments and improves cash flow management.
