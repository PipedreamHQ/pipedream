# Overview

The AirOps API offers a platform for aviation managementâ€”think flight scheduling, maintenance tracking, and operational logistics. With this API on Pipedream, you get to automate and integrate these aviation tasks into broader business systems. Say goodbye to manual data entry and hello to streamlined workflows that connect your flight operations with other business tools for reporting, compliance, or customer service.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Flight Scheduling Notifications**: When a new flight is scheduled within AirOps, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends out automated notifications to crew and passengers via email or SMS using the Twilio app. This workflow ensures everyone stays informed in real-time.

- **Maintenance Tracking and Alerts**: Set up a workflow that monitors the AirOps API for maintenance updates. When a maintenance task is due or completed, the workflow can create a task in a project management tool like Asana, or notify the maintenance team through Slack, keeping everyone on the same page.

- **Flight Data Analysis and Reporting**: Leverage Pipedream to pull historical flight data from AirOps at regular intervals, send it to a data storage app like Google Sheets or a database, and then use that data for performance analysis, cost tracking, or generating compliance reports automatically.
