# Overview

You can use the Digital Ocean API to manage Droplets (virtual private servers),
resources within those Droplets, and other account-wide resources like domains
and images.

Examples of what you can build using the Digital Ocean API include:

- A script to create and destroy Droplets on demand
- A script to snapshot (back up) your Droplets on a regular basis
- A script to add and remove SSH keys from your account
- A script to manage domain records (DNS)
- A script to add and remove Floating IPs from your account
