# Overview

The Digital Ocean API provides programmatic access to manage Digital Ocean resources such as Droplets, Spaces, and Databases. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to automate a variety of tasks, like spinning up new servers, scaling resources, or integrating cloud infrastructure management into your workflow. It's a powerful tool for DevOps automation, allowing for the dynamic management of infrastructure in response to events or schedules.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Environment Setup**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream to create a new Droplet when a new feature branch is created in your GitHub repository. This can include cloning the repo to the server, installing necessary dependencies, and setting up a staging URL.

- **Resource Scaling Based on Load**: Monitor your application's performance metrics and use the Digital Ocean API to scale your Droplet sizes up or down based on the CPU or memory usage. This workflow could be triggered by a monitoring tool like Datadog, which sends an alert to Pipedream when resource usage hits certain thresholds.

- **Backup Automation**: Schedule daily or weekly backups of your Digital Ocean volumes or databases to Spaces. Use Pipedream's cron job feature to trigger backups and notify your team via Slack or email upon completion or if any errors occur.
