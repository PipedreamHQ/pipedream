# Overview

With Gift Up!, you can build a Gifts app that lets users send each other
virtual gifts. The app would need to integrate with the Gift Up! API to send
and receive gifts.

Here are some examples of what you could build with the Gift Up! API:

- A gift app that lets users send each other virtual gifts
- A gift shop that sells virtual gifts
- A gift exchange service that lets users trade gifts with each other
- A gift registry that lets users track their gift wishlists
