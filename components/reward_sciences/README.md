# Overview

The Reward Sciences API enables the integration of loyalty and rewards functionalities into your services. With it, you can create and manage rewards programs, automate point distribution, track user activities, and redeem rewards. On Pipedream, you can tap into these capabilities to build automated workflows that interact with other apps, trigger actions based on events, and manipulate data to enhance customer engagement.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Reward for Customer Reviews:** After a customer submits a review through a service like Trustpilot, the Reward Sciences API can be triggered on Pipedream to award points to the customer's account, encouraging more feedback and customer interaction.

- **E-commerce Purchase Rewards:** When a new order is placed in Shopify, use Pipedream to invoke the Reward Sciences API to add points to the customer's loyalty account based on the purchase amount, fostering repeat business.

- **Referral Program Management:** Integrate a form tool like Typeform with Reward Sciences via Pipedream. When a user submits a referral form, you can automatically grant points to the referrer's account, streamlining your referral incentives.
