# Overview

The Findymail API provides a way to enrich and validate email contacts. Leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can automate workflows that trigger on various events to lookup emails, auto-populate CRM fields, validate email data, or even enhance marketing lists with accurate contact information. Using Findymail's API in Pipedream, you can create intricate serverless workflows that react to various triggers, such as webhooks, scheduled timers, or actions from other apps, to integrate email data enrichment into your business processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Enrich New Subscriber Data**: When a new subscriber signs up on your platform, trigger a Pipedream workflow to lookup the provided email via the Findymail API. Use the enriched data to segment the subscriber into marketing campaigns or personalize communications.

- **Maintain CRM Integrity**: Schedule a Pipedream workflow to periodically validate and update email addresses in your CRM. Connect Findymail with CRM platforms like Salesforce or HubSpot, ensuring the email data is correct and up-to-date.

- **Automate Lead Generation**: On receiving a new lead's partial contact details from a form submission or a LinkedIn scrape, use a Pipedream workflow to find the full email address with Findymail. Then, dispatch the contact to a mailing list in Mailchimp or trigger a personalized outreach sequence.
