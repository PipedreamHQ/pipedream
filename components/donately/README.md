# Overview

The Donately API provides a suite of endpoints for managing fundraising activities, processing donations, and analyzing donor data. With Pipedream, you can automate donation tracking, engage donors with personalized communications, and sync fundraising data across various platforms. It's a powerful tool for nonprofits and charitable organizations looking to streamline their fundraising operations and gain deeper insights into their donor base.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Thank-You Emails**: Trigger an email to send automatically through SendGrid or another email service each time a new donation is received via Donately. Customize the message with donor details and donation amount to create a personal touch.

- **Real-Time Donation Alerts**: Set up a workflow to post a message in a Slack channel whenever a new donation comes in. This keeps teams informed and can foster a sense of community and urgency around fundraising campaigns.

- **Monthly Donation Reports**: Schedule a monthly workflow that aggregates donation data from Donately, processes it to generate insights, and compiles a report. The report is then sent to a Google Sheet for easy sharing and analysis by stakeholders.
