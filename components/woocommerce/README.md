# Overview

The WooCommerce API allows developers to interact with WooCommerce sites in a
number of ways. With the API, developers can create, read, update, and delete
data such as products, orders, customers, etc. WooCommerce also provides a
number of API endpoints for retrieving information about the site, such as
settings, currencies, etc.

Here are some examples of what you can build using the WooCommerce API:

- A mobile app for browsing and ordering products from a WooCommerce store
- A desktop application for managing a WooCommerce store
- A web application for displaying real-time information about a WooCommerce
  store (sales, stock levels, etc)
- An API extension for WooCommerce that allows third-party applications to
  access data in a WooCommerce store
