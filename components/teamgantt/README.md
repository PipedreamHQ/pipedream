# Overview

The TeamGantt API allows you to interact programmatically with your TeamGantt project management data. With it, you can create, read, update, and delete various project elements, such as tasks, milestones, and time entries. Integrating the TeamGantt API with Pipedream enables you to automate your project workflows, sync data across platforms, and react to events in real-time. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can connect TeamGantt to a myriad of other apps and services to streamline your project management processes.

# Example Workflows

- **Sync Project Tasks with Google Calendar**: Automatically create events in Google Calendar whenever a new task is added to a TeamGantt project. This ensures your scheduling remains coherent across both platforms and helps with time management without manual entry.

- **Update Slack Status Based on Task Deadlines**: Set up a workflow to monitor your TeamGantt tasks for upcoming deadlines. When a deadline is near, automatically update your Slack status to reflect your focus on the impending task, helping your team know when you're busy.

- **Email Reporting for Completed Milestones**: When a milestone is marked as completed in TeamGantt, trigger an automated email to stakeholders with the details of the completed milestone. This keeps everyone informed and can trigger subsequent phases of a project.
