# Overview

The Gleap API allows for the seamless integration of customer feedback into your product development cycle. With Gleap, you can collect bug reports, feature requests, and general feedback, all enriched with screenshots, replay videos, and logs to give you comprehensive insights into user experiences. In Pipedream, you can harness this API to automate workflows, connect feedback to your issue trackers or communication platforms, and analyze data to inform product improvements.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Feedback to Project Management Tools:** Automatically create new tasks or tickets in project management tools like Jira or Trello whenever a new feedback is submitted through Gleap. This keeps your development team instantly in the loop and ensures no user feedback slips through the cracks.

- **Trigger Notifications Based on Feedback Severity:** Set up a workflow that evaluates the severity of feedback from Gleap and triggers instant alerts through communication platforms like Slack, Discord, or email for high-severity reports, ensuring rapid response to critical issues.

- **Feedback Aggregation and Analysis:** Collect and aggregate feedback data from Gleap into a Google Sheets or Airtable base for advanced analysis and reporting. Use this data to spot trends, prioritize product enhancements, and make data-driven decisions.
