# Overview

The Memberful API lets you handle memberships and subscriptions with precision. Using Pipedream, you can automate tasks around Memberful's robust features, like syncing member data, managing subscriptions, or triggering events based on membership changes. Pipedream's serverless platform turns these tasks into workflows you can build, run, and observe with ease.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Memberful Subscriptions with Mailchimp**: Automate the process of syncing new Memberful subscribers to a Mailchimp audience. When a new member subscribes through Memberful, use a Pipedream workflow to add their information to a specified Mailchimp list, ensuring your email marketing campaigns are always targeting the most up-to-date audience.

- **Post Slack Notifications for Membership Updates**: Keep your team informed by posting notifications to a Slack channel whenever a Memberful membership is updated. Whether itâ€™s a new subscription, cancellation, or a pause, a Pipedream workflow can capture these events and send a message to Slack, keeping everyone in the loop without manual checks.

- **Generate Invoices Using Stripe for New Members**: When a new member signs up through Memberful, create an automated workflow in Pipedream that generates and sends an invoice via Stripe. This streamlines the billing process, making sure that every new member is promptly billed, and their payment information is stored correctly in Stripe for future transactions.
