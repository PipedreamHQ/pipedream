# Overview

The Salesmsg API facilitates two-way SMS and MMS communications, allowing users to send, receive, and manage messages programmatically. It provides a suite of tools to integrate texting capabilities into various workflows and systems. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to automate conversations, sync with customer databases, trigger notifications, and much more, utilizing Pipedream's serverless platform to connect Salesmsg with a plethora of other apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support Tickets**: Create a workflow that listens for incoming messages on Salesmsg, parses the content, and automatically creates a support ticket in a system like Zendesk or Jira. This enables immediate ticket creation without manual intervention.

- **SMS Drip Campaigns Based on User Actions**: Use the Salesmsg API on Pipedream to send a series of timed follow-up messages to users who take a specific action in your app like signing up or making a purchase. Connect to apps like Shopify or Salesforce to trigger these messages based on user behavior.

- **Real-time CRM Updates**: Build a workflow that updates a contact record in a CRM like HubSpot whenever a text message is sent or received in Salesmsg. This keeps your CRM up-to-date with the latest customer interactions, ensuring a coherent view of communication history.
