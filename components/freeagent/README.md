# Overview

FreeAgent, a powerful accounting tool, offers an API enabling businesses to automate various aspects of financial management. With the FreeAgent API, you can create, read, update, and delete invoices, bills, expenses, and much more, directly through Pipedream. This allows for the creation of custom automations that can save time, reduce errors, and streamline financial operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Generation and Dispatch**: Upon a new sale from an e-commerce platform like Shopify, trigger a Pipedream workflow to create and send an invoice via FreeAgent, ensuring timely billing and consistency in invoice management.

- **Expense Tracking and Reporting**: Connect FreeAgent to a time tracking app like Toggl. Use Pipedream to create an expense in FreeAgent whenever a new time entry is logged in Toggl, making sure all billable hours are accounted for and simplifying client billing.

- **Financial Health Dashboard**: Integrate FreeAgent with a data visualization tool such as Google Sheets on Pipedream. Automate the export of financial data like cash flow, profit and loss, and overdue invoices into a Google Sheet for real-time financial analysis and decision-making.
