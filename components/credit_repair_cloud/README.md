# Overview

Credit Repair Cloud API provides a suite of tools to manage and automate tasks for credit repair businesses. With this API, you can create and manage clients, leads, affiliates, and credit reports, as well as automate the credit repair process. Integrating this API with Pipedream allows you to build serverless workflows that can harness data from Credit Repair Cloud and connect it with other services to enhance your credit repair operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated New Client Onboarding**: When a new client signs up using a web form, trigger a Pipedream workflow that automatically creates a new client profile in Credit Repair Cloud. This workflow can also send a welcome email to the client and alert your team via Slack.

- **Lead Tracking and Follow-Up**: Use Pipedream to monitor new leads in Credit Repair Cloud. When a lead is flagged as ‘hot’, trigger a sequence of follow-up emails and tasks, and log the activity in a CRM like Salesforce for further action by the sales team.

- **Monthly Credit Report Generation**: Schedule a Pipedream workflow to generate and email credit reports to clients on a monthly basis. This workflow can also update the client’s record in Credit Repair Cloud with the latest report details and perform data analysis by connecting to Google Sheets.
