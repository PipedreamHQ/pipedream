# Overview

The Firmalyzer IoTVAS API allows you to build a variety of applications that
can analyze firmware for vulnerabilities. Some examples of applications that
can be built using the Firmalyzer IoTVAS API include:

- A vulnerability scanner that can check firmware for known vulnerabilities and
  report them to the user.
- A tool that can automatically update firmware to the latest version, in order
  to patch vulnerabilities.
- A system that can monitor firmware for changes and report back to the user if
  any changes are detected.
