# Overview

Firmalyzer IoTVAS API provides a platform for assessing the security of IoT devices. By using this API, you can automate the analysis of firmware, uncover vulnerabilities, check for outdated software, and verify compliance with security standards. Integrating Firmalyzer with Pipedream allows for the seamless incorporation of IoT security checks into broader automation workflows, which can facilitate continuous monitoring, alerting, and reporting within your infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning Workflow**: Trigger a daily Pipedream workflow that sends your IoT device firmware to Firmalyzer IoTVAS API for analysis. Upon detection of new vulnerabilities, use the SendGrid app to notify your security team, and log the findings in a Google Sheet for record-keeping.

- **CI/CD Pipeline Security Integration**: Integrate Firmalyzer IoTVAS API into your existing CI/CD pipeline on Pipedream. Whenever new firmware is ready for deployment, automatically scan it for security issues. If any high-risk vulnerabilities are found, halt the deployment process and open a GitHub issue for your development team to address.

- **Compliance Monitoring and Reporting**: Use Pipedream to periodically check your IoT devices against the latest security standards with Firmalyzer IoTVAS API. Store compliance status in a Pipedream data store and if a device falls out of compliance, trigger an alert to your Slack channel and create a detailed report in a Markdown file for review by your compliance team.
