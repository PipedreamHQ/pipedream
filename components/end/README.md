# Overview

The End API on Pipedream allows you to programmatically end workflows early based on specific conditions or logic. This functionality is essential for creating efficient workflows that avoid unnecessary processing, thereby saving time and resources. By integrating conditional logic, users can set parameters under which a workflow should terminate, ensuring that only relevant actions are executed.

# Example Use Cases

- **Conditional Data Processing**: Build a workflow that processes incoming data and uses the End API to stop the workflow if the data meets certain criteria. For example, if you're handling customer feedback and receive a response categorized as "neutral," you might end the process early, saving resources for more critical "positive" or "negative" feedback that triggers a more complex response sequence.

- **Error Handling**: Set up a workflow that involves multiple API calls where each step depends on the success of the previous one. Use the End API to terminate the workflow early if an API call fails, preventing subsequent steps from executing based on bad data and potentially alerting a team to the issue.

- **Resource Threshold Monitoring**: In workflows where resource consumption is monitored (like API usage, compute time, etc.), integrate the End API to stop the workflow once a certain threshold is reached. This can prevent exceeding quotas or incurring unexpected costs, especially useful in systems where cost management is crucial.
