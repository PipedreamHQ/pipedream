# Overview

The End API on Pipedream allows you to terminate a workflow prematurely under specific conditions. This can be incredibly useful for creating efficient automations that only run when necessary, thus saving computational resources and streamlining operations. By integrating conditional logic, the End API can check certain criteria before deciding whether to continue the execution of remaining steps in a workflow.

# Example Use Cases

- **Filter Out Irrelevant Data**: Use the End API to stop a workflow if incoming data does not meet certain criteria. This is ideal for processing only relevant entries in data analytics and monitoring systems.

- **User Verification Before Proceeding**: In a user registration workflow, integrate the End API to terminate the process if the user's email is already in the database, thereby preventing duplicate entries.

- **Conditional Notifications**: Set up a workflow where notifications (via email, SMS, etc.) are only sent if specific thresholds are met, using the End API to halt the process if conditions aren't right.
