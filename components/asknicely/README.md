# Overview

The AskNicely API enables you to tap into customer feedback processes by automating the collection and analysis of customer satisfaction data. With Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create custom workflows that trigger on specific events, interact with other apps, and perform actions based on customer feedback scores and comments. Whether you're syncing data to a CRM, triggering email campaigns based on scores, or aggregating responses for analysis, the API's integration into Pipedream opens a world of possibilities for enhancing customer experience and operational efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Feedback to CRM:** Automatically update customer records in Salesforce with the latest Net Promoter Score (NPS) and feedback collected via AskNicely. This ensures that customer-facing teams have the most current sentiment data at their fingertips.

- **Trigger Support Tickets:** Create a workflow that monitors for low NPS scores and automatically generates a support ticket in Zendesk. This allows customer service teams to swiftly address concerns and potentially turn detractors into promoters.

- **Aggregate Feedback for Analysis:** Collect all AskNicely feedback responses and feed them into a Google Sheets document. Apply further analysis or visualizations to track trends and make data-driven decisions to improve customer satisfaction.
