# Overview

The Zoho Projects API lets you harness the full potential of project management by enabling seamless integration with other tools and automating routine tasks. With it, you can create projects, manage tasks, track time, and customize your workflow. On Pipedream, you can leverage this API to build robust automations that connect Zoho Projects with a plethora of other apps, streamlining project tracking and collaboration workflows, all without writing a single line of code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Project Status Updates to Slack**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when the status of a project in Zoho Projects changes. Then, post an update to a designated Slack channel to keep your team informed in real time about the project's progress.

- **New Task Assignment Email Notifications**: When a new task is created in Zoho Projects, use Pipedream to automatically send out an email notification to the assigned team member or client. This could be done by integrating with an email service like SendGrid, ensuring immediate communication and clarity on new assignments.

- **GitHub Commit Trigger for Time Tracking**: Start a time entry in Zoho Projects whenever a new commit is made to a specific GitHub repository. This allows for precise tracking of development time, providing valuable insights for project management and billing purposes.

# Troubleshooting

**Issues Connecting My Account: IP Allowlist**

If your Zoho security policy includes an IP Allowlist, update it to connect your account:

1. Add this IP Range: `44.223.89.56` - `44.223.89.63`.
2. Include your current IP Address because the initial OAuth authorization request originates from your browser.
3. Set up a [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/vpc#create-a-new-vpc). Add the [static IP address](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/vpc#find-the-static-outbound-ip-address-for-a-vpc) to Zoho's IP Allowlist. Note: VPCs are available with Pipedream's **Business Plan** or higher. See [pricing](https://pipedream.com/pricing) for details.

After connecting your account, make sure to [run the workflow within a VPC](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/vpc#run-workflows-within-a-vpc).
