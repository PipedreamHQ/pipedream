# Overview

The Yotpo - Loyalty & Referrals API unlocks the potential to craft custom loyalty and referral programs by integrating with your tech stack through Pipedream. With this API, you can manage rewards, referrals, and customer loyalty data in real-time. Automate the process of rewarding customers for their engagement, track referral sources, and analyze program effectiveness directly through Pipedream's serverless platform.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Referral Sign-ups to CRM:** When a user signs up through a referral link, trigger a workflow to add the new customer details to your CRM system. This maintains an updated list of leads generated via referrals, allowing for targeted follow-ups or engagement campaigns.

- **Reward Points Balance Updates to Email Marketing Tool:** Automate the process of updating customer reward points balance in an email marketing tool like Mailchimp. Once points are updated or redeemed, Pipedream can trigger a personalized email campaign to encourage further purchases or reward redemptions.

- **Aggregate Customer Loyalty Data for Analytics:** Collect and send customer loyalty data points to a service like Google Sheets or a BI tool. Use this aggregated data to analyze trends, measure program ROI, and adjust strategies for maximizing engagement and retention.
