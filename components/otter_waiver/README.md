# Overview

The Otter Waiver API enables users to manage and automate the processes surrounding digital waivers and forms. This is particularly useful for businesses or organizations that require participants to sign waivers for activities, services, or events. By integrating with Pipedream, users can automate waiver creation, retrieval, and management, streamlining operations and ensuring compliance with legal standards.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Waiver Collection for Event Registrations**: When a new registration is received via an event management app like Eventbrite, automatically generate and send a waiver form using the Otter Waiver API. Track the status of the waiver in a Google Sheet to ensure all participants are compliant before the event.

- **Customer Onboarding for Gyms or Activity Centers**: On a new member signup in a CRM like Salesforce, use Otter Waiver API to send a liability waiver. Once the waiver is signed, update their membership status in the CRM and trigger a welcome email sequence through an email marketing platform like Mailchimp.

- **Streamlining Workflow in Adventure Sports**: For adventure sports companies using scheduling apps like Calendly for bookings, integrate Otter Waiver API to send waivers to customers once they book an appointment. Upon waiver completion, update the booking status and inform the guide or instructor via a communication platform like Slack.
