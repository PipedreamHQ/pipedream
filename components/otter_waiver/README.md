# Overview

The Otter Waiver API enables digital management of liability waivers, allowing businesses to create, distribute, and manage waivers electronically. It's particularly useful for sectors like sports, recreation, and events where waivers are frequently required to mitigate legal risks. By automating waiver processes, organizations can streamline operations, ensure compliance, and enhance customer experience.

# Example Use Cases

- **Event Registration and Waiver Management**: Integrate Otter Waiver with Eventbrite using Pipedream to automatically send waivers to event registrants. Once an attendee registers for an event on Eventbrite, trigger a workflow in Pipedream that sends a waiver via Otter Waiver, ensuring all participants are legally covered before the event starts.

- **Gym Membership Onboarding**: Connect Otter Waiver with a gym's membership system (like Mindbody). When a new member is added to the gym's system, use Pipedream to automatically send a digital waiver through Otter Waiver. This ensures that all legal prerequisites are completed seamlessly as part of the onboarding process.

- **Adventure Sports Booking Confirmation**: For businesses in adventure sports, couple Otter Waiver with a booking system like FareHarbor or Peek Pro. When a customer books an adventure, trigger a Pipedream workflow to send a liability waiver via Otter Waiver, ensuring that the customer agrees to the terms and conditions before participating in the activity.
