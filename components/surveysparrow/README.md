# Overview

The SurveySparrow API lets you tap into a robust platform for gathering feedback and insights. With Pipedream, you can automate interactions with your surveys, manage contacts, and analyze responses in real time. You can create workflows that trigger on new survey responses, sync data to other services, or even kick off email campaigns based on survey results. The power of Pipedream's serverless platform means you can integrate SurveySparrow with hundreds of other apps, enabling limitless automation scenarios without writing extensive code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Response Acknowledgment**: Send a thank you email automatically using the Gmail app on Pipedream when a new SurveySparrow response is received. This keeps your respondents engaged and shows appreciation for their input.

- **Sync Survey Data to Google Sheets**: Every time a survey is completed, append the responses to a Google Sheet for easy data analysis and sharing. This workflow can be vital for teams that rely on collaborative data analysis.

- **Trigger Follow-up Actions Based on Responses**: Use SurveySparrow responses to trigger follow-up tasks or actions in project management tools like Trello or Asana. For instance, if a respondent reports an issue, automatically create a Trello card to ensure it is addressed in a timely manner.
