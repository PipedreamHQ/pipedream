# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Onboarding Emails**: Automatically send personalized onboarding emails to new customers using Netcore Cloud when they sign up via your platform. Set up a workflow on Pipedream that triggers upon a new user registration event in your database (like Firebase or MongoDB), then uses the Netcore Cloud API to send tailored email messages that guide them through the initial setup or product usage.

- **User Activity-Based SMS Notifications**: Create a workflow where specific user actions on your app—like reaching a milestone or completing a key task—trigger SMS notifications via Netcore Cloud. This can be effectively paired with analytics tools like Google Analytics on Pipedream, where user event data is processed to trigger contextually relevant SMS messages, thus enhancing user engagement through timely and relevant communication.

- **Syncing Email Campaign Stats to Google Sheets**: After executing an email campaign via Netcore Cloud, use Pipedream to automatically extract campaign performance data and populate a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This workflow can be scheduled to run at regular intervals, providing up-to-date campaign analytics that help in quick decision-making and reporting. This is particularly useful for marketing teams needing real-time data visualization and sharing.
