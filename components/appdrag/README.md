# Overview

The AppDrag API lets you manage cloud functions, databases, and mail sending features within your AppDrag projects. With Pipedream, you can harness these capabilities to automate workflows such as syncing data between different platforms, processing form submissions, or triggering communication sequences. By connecting AppDrag’s API to Pipedream, you gain the ability to create serverless workflows that can respond to various triggers like webhooks, schedules, or even actions from other apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Database Backups**  
  Sync your AppDrag database to a cloud storage service like Google Drive. Use Pipedream to schedule daily exports of your database and automatically upload the backup files, ensuring you always have a recent copy of your data stored safely.

- **Process Contact Form Submissions**  
  Capture submissions from a web contact form built with AppDrag and use Pipedream to parse and insert the data into a customer relationship management (CRM) system like Salesforce. This workflow can notify your sales team or trigger follow-up actions within the CRM.

- **Email Campaign Trigger**  
  Initiate an email sequence in a marketing platform such as Mailchimp whenever a new user signs up through your AppDrag site. Pipedream can listen for new sign-ups via AppDrag’s API and push the contact information to Mailchimp, automating your email marketing efforts.
