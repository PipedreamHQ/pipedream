# Overview

Elevio delivers in-app contextual help to boost user engagement and reduce support loads by providing accessible and timely help. With the Elevio API, you can automate content delivery, update help articles, manage translations, and track user interactions across your app, directly integrating these capabilities into your existing workflows on Pipedream. This flexibility allows for dynamic content updates, targeted help based on user behavior, and immediate syncing with your CRM or support tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Elevio Knowledge Base Updates to Slack**: Automatically notify your team in Slack whenever a new article is added or an existing article is updated in Elevio. This keeps your support and content teams instantly informed about changes, ensuring everyone is aligned and up-to-date without manually checking for updates.

- **Automate User Support Tickets in Zendesk**: When a user interacts with an Elevio help module and still submits a support ticket, automatically create a new ticket in Zendesk with the user's question and their interaction history from Elevio. This provides your support team with context to offer more personalized help and potentially resolve issues faster.

- **User Feedback Analysis with Google Sheets**: Collect feedback on your Elevio articles directly into a Google Sheet for analysis. Each time a user leaves feedback via Elevio, append their comments along with the article details to a spreadsheet. This can be used to track satisfaction and identify areas for improvement in your help content.
