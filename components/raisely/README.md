# Overview

The Raisely API lets you manage and automate interactions with your fundraising campaigns. It can be used for retrieving campaign data, updating donor records, or triggering communications. When paired with Pipedream, these capabilities grow exponentially, allowing for integration with countless other services for enhanced automation and data flow. For example, syncing donor information with a CRM, sending custom thank you emails, or posting updates to social media platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Donors with CRM**: Integrate Raisely with a CRM like Salesforce. When a new donation is recorded in Raisely, use the API to create or update the donor's details in Salesforce, ensuring your donor records are always current.

- **Distribute Custom Thank You Emails**: After a donation, trigger an automated, personalized thank you email using a service like SendGrid. Combine Raisely's data with SendGrid's email sending capabilities to make each donor feel appreciated with a custom message.

- **Social Media Engagement**: Share donor milestones or campaign updates to social platforms such as Twitter. When a campaign hits a milestone, use Raisely API to fetch the latest data and post a celebratory message or thank donors publicly for their support.
