# Overview

The ElevenLabs API offers text-to-speech capabilities with realistic voice synthesis. Integrating this API on Pipedream allows you to build automated workflows that convert text content into spoken audio files. You can trigger these conversions from various events, process the text data, send it to the ElevenLabs API, and handle the audio outputâ€”all within a serverless environment.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Narration**: Convert blog posts to audio as they are published. Using a webhook to detect new content, Pipedream can send the text to ElevenLabs, and then store or distribute the audio file, possibly integrating with a CMS or a cloud storage service like Dropbox.

- **Real-Time Audio Messaging**: Generate voice messages from chat inputs. With Pipedream, you can listen for messages on platforms like Slack, pass them through ElevenLabs to create audio, and then post the result back into the chat, offering an alternative for consuming text content.

- **Voice-Enabled Alerts**: Send spoken alerts based on triggered events. For instance, if your application's health monitoring system detects an issue, Pipedream can fetch the details, run them through ElevenLabs to synthesize a voice alert, and then use Twilio to send a voice message to your phone.
