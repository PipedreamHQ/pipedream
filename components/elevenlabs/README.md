# Overview

The ElevenLabs API provides advanced text-to-speech capabilities, enabling users to convert text into realistic speech with customizable voices and languages. With this API on Pipedream, you can automate the creation of voiceovers, narrations, and any audio content that requires human-like speech synthesis. It's ideal for generating dynamic audio content for podcasts, videos, or even reading out notifications aloud.

## Example Use Cases

- **Dynamic Podcast Episodes**: Combine ElevenLabs API with RSS feed inputs to transform blog posts or written content into podcast episodes. Automatically fetch new articles using Pipedream's RSS trigger, then use ElevenLabs to create the audio and upload it to your hosting service.

- **Video Narration Automation**: Automate the process of creating narrations for your YouTube videos. Connect the ElevenLabs API to Google Sheets or Airtable, where you store your video scripts, and use Pipedream to fetch and convert these scripts into voiceovers that can be added to your video editing workflow.

- **Voice Alert System**: Create a voice alert system for real-time notifications. Use Pipedream to integrate with monitoring tools like Datadog or New Relic. When a specific alert is triggered, the ElevenLabs API can generate a spoken message, which can be sent to a communication platform like Twilio to make a call or send an audio SMS.
