# Overview

The Grade.us API enables you to automate the collection and management of customer reviews. With this API, you can streamline review requests, responses, reporting, and alerting of reviews across different platforms. Integrating the Grade.us API with Pipedream allows you to create powerful workflows to manage your online reputation efficiently. You can trigger actions based on review events, analyze sentiment, connect with CRM systems, or initiate marketing campaigns based on the reviews collected.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Review Request Follow-ups**: After closing a ticket in a customer service platform like Zendesk, use Pipedream to trigger a workflow that sends an automatic review request to the customer via the Grade.us API, helping you to increase the number of reviews.

- **Review Alerts and Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze new reviews for negative sentiment using a sentiment analysis service like MonkeyLearn. If a review is negative, create a high-priority task in a task management app like Asana and alert the team via a Slack message.

- **Generate Performance Reports**: Schedule a weekly workflow in Pipedream that fetches all reviews from the past week using the Grade.us API, aggregates review scores, and sends a performance report to your team's email using a service like SendGrid.
