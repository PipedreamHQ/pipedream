# Overview

Pulsetic API lets you monitor your websites and servers, sending notifications when downtime occurs or performance issues arise. With Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create powerful, automated workflows that respond to Pulsetic events in real-time. For instance, you can automate incident management by connecting Pulsetic to ticketing systems, trigger alerts in communication channels, or log performance data for analysis. Pipedream's zero-management data stores also allow you to keep track of incident history without needing a separate database.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Incident Reporting**: When Pulsetic detects an outage, this workflow automatically creates a ticket in a service like Jira or Zendesk. It ensures that support teams are immediately aware of issues, streamlining the response process.

- **Performance Alerting in Slack**: Set up notifications to a Slack channel when Pulsetic reports a slow response time or downtime. This keeps your team in the loop, enabling quick action to resolve the issue and maintain service quality.

- **Downtime Log with Google Sheets**: Every time Pulsetic reports downtime, the workflow appends a new row to a Google Sheet. This provides a historical log of incidents, aiding in analyzing patterns and improving future uptime.
