# Overview

The SimpleTexting API provides developers with tools to build powerful
applications that leverage the power of SMS. With the API, you can easily send
and receive text messages, manage contacts, create and send surveys, create
automated campaigns, and more. Here are some examples of what you can build
using the SimpleTexting API:

- Interactive customer service bots: Use automated text messages to create
  interactive conversations with customers, providing answers to common
  queries, product recommendations, and more.
- SMS alerts: Leverage automated text messages to send alerts and updates to
  customers, such as ticket confirmations and order tracking.
- Automated campaign flows: Create automated workflows that consist of multiple
  steps, such as sending targeted messages, setting triggers, and tracking user
  response.
- Assistive scheduling: Automatically schedule messages to be sent out at a
  later date, such as appointment reminders, notifications of upcoming
  deadlines, and so on.
- Text-to-landline services: Create automated surveys and connect your users to
  a representative via their phone.
- Two-way broadcasting: Design broadcast messages that allow users to reply
  with a selection of options and create automated follow-ups based on their
  response.
- Bulk messaging: Send text messages to large numbers of contacts, with
  built-in tools to target specific audiences and track open and response
  rates.
- Message segmentation: Group contacts into segments based on user data and
  create targeted messages based on those segments.
