# Overview

The SimpleTexting API offers a suite of messaging capabilities that can be leveraged to build powerful communication workflows on Pipedream. It enables automated sending of SMS and MMS messages, managing contacts, and receiving message replies. By integrating SimpleTexting with Pipedream, you can create real-time, event-driven automations that trigger SMS campaigns based on user behavior, synchronize contacts across platforms, and streamline notifications for various operational processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support Follow-up**: Create a workflow where after a customer support ticket is resolved in your helpdesk software (e.g., Zendesk), an SMS message is automatically sent via SimpleTexting to gather feedback on the support experience.

- **E-commerce Order Confirmation and Updates**: Set up an automation where once a new order is placed through an e-commerce platform (e.g., Shopify), a confirmation message is sent to the customer. Further, track the order status and send real-time shipping updates via SMS as the order progresses.

- **Event Registration Alerts**: When a participant registers for an event via an event management platform (e.g., Eventbrite), use SimpleTexting to send a confirmation message with event details, and schedule reminder texts leading up to the event date.
