The SimpleTexting API provides developers with tools to build powerful applications that leverage the power of SMS. With the API, you can easily send and receive text messages, manage contacts, create and send surveys, create automated campaigns, and more. Here are some examples of what you can build using the SimpleTexting API:

- Interactive customer service bots: Use automated text messages to create interactive conversations with customers, providing answers to common queries, product recommendations, and more.

- SMS alerts: Leverage automated text messages to send alerts and updates to customers, such as ticket confirmations and order tracking.

- Automated campaign flows: Create automated workflows that consist of multiple steps, such as sending targeted messages, setting triggers, and tracking user response.

- Assistive scheduling: Automatically schedule messages to be sent out at a later date, such as appointment reminders, notifications of upcoming deadlines, and so on.

- Text-to-landline services: Create automated surveys and connect your users to a representative via their phone.

- Two-way broadcasting: Design broadcast messages that allow users to reply with a selection of options and create automated follow-ups based on their response.

- Bulk messaging: Send text messages to large numbers of contacts, with built-in tools to target specific audiences and track open and response rates.
