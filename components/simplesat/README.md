# Overview

The Simplesat API allows you to automate and integrate customer feedback workflows directly with your other business processes. With this API, you can seamlessly gather customer satisfaction ratings, Net Promoter Scores, and firsthand testimonials. You can trigger actions based on feedback, sync data to CRM or support tools, and analyze customer sentiment in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Satisfaction-Driven Support Tickets**: Automate the creation of support tickets in a tool like Zendesk when a customer submits a negative satisfaction survey, flagging the customer service team to follow up and address the concerns quickly.

- **NPS Score Aggregation and Alerting**: Use Pipedream to aggregate Net Promoter Score responses into a Google Sheet for easy tracking. Set up alerts to notify the team via Slack or email when scores below a certain threshold are submitted, indicating a potential customer churn risk.

- **Testimonial Collection and Marketing Automation**: Collect positive testimonials through the Simplesat API and automatically push them to your marketing platforms, like Mailchimp, to be featured in newsletters or on your website, enhancing social proof and brand reputation.
