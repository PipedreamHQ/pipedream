# Overview

DocsAutomator API allows you to automate the creation, updating, and management of documents. You can use it to generate reports, invoices, contracts, or any customized documents from templates, based on dynamic data inputs. This is especially useful for businesses needing to streamline their document workflow, reduce manual data entry errors, and ensure consistency in their documentation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Generation**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream that triggers when a new sale is recorded in your CRM (like Salesforce). The workflow fetches the sale details, uses DocsAutomator to fill in an invoice template, and then emails the generated invoice directly to the customer.

- **Contract Creation from CRM Events**: Whenever a new client is added to a CRM, such as HubSpot, automatically create a personalized contract using DocsAutomator. The workflow can pull client details from the CRM, input them into a predefined contract template, and then save the generated contract in a cloud storage like Google Drive.

- **Monthly Report Compilation**: Automate the monthly gathering of business metrics from various sources like Google Sheets, databases, or other APIs, compile them into a comprehensive report using DocsAutomator, and then distribute the report via Slack to relevant stakeholders.
