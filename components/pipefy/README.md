# Overview

Pipefy is a platform that empowers users to streamline complex processes and workflows without the need for technical skills. With the Pipefy API, you can automate various aspects of your Pipefy environment, such as creating cards, updating fields, and managing pipelines programmatically. Use Pipedream to connect Pipefy with hundreds of other apps and orchestrate workflows that can save time, reduce errors, and enhance efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Client Onboarding:** Trigger a Pipedream workflow when a new client fills out a form on your website. Use the Pipefy API to create a new card in your Client Onboarding pipe, and then send a welcome email to the client using the Gmail app. This ensures a smooth and systematic onboarding experience for each new client.

- **Issue Tracking Integration:** Connect Pipefy to your customer support platform, like Zendesk. When a support ticket is marked as a bug, automatically create a card in your Pipefy Bug Tracking pipe and assign it to the development team. This creates a seamless bridge between customer support and the dev team, ensuring quick response to critical issues.

- **Sales Lead Management:** Start a workflow whenever a new lead is captured via LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms. Add the lead as a card in your Pipefy Sales Pipeline, and simultaneously update your CRM, such as Salesforce, with the new lead's information. This cuts down manual entry and keeps your sales team informed about fresh opportunities in real-time.
