# Overview

The StealthSeminar API enables automated control over webinar events. With it, you can register participants, retrieve webinar stats, and manage your webinars programmatically. When used within Pipedream's ecosystem, you can craft workflows that trigger on specific conditions, manipulate data, and connect with countless other apps. Pipedream's serverless platform offers a powerful way to glue together different API services, making your webinar management more efficient and integrated with your existing tech stack.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Attendee Registration**: Register attendees to your webinars automatically when a new sign-up is detected in your CRM, like Salesforce or HubSpot. Pipedream can listen for new contacts and use StealthSeminar's API to register them for a scheduled webinar, all without manual intervention.

- **Webinar Performance Reporting to Slack**: After a webinar concludes, compile key performance metrics and send a summary report directly to a Slack channel. By combining StealthSeminar's data with Pipedream's Slack integration, you keep your team instantly informed about webinar engagement and attendance.

- **Dynamic Email Follow-ups with SendGrid**: Use attendee behavior data from StealthSeminar to segment your audience and send personalized follow-up emails through SendGrid. Whether an attendee missed the event or asked a question, tailor your email content accordingly and automate the sending process with Pipedream workflows.
