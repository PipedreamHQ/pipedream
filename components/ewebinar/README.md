# Overview

The eWebinar API allows you to automate interactions with your eWebinar sessions, such as listing upcoming webinars, registering participants, and retrieving attendee data. By integrating the eWebinar API with Pipedream, you can craft workflows that connect your webinars with other apps and services, enabling you to streamline event management, follow-up processes, and audience engagement.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Registrants to CRM**: Register a participant for an eWebinar event in Pipedream, then automatically add that participant's details to a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. This keeps your sales or customer service team updated in real time.

- **Automate Follow-Up Emails**: After a webinar, use Pipedream to trigger a workflow that sends personalized follow-up emails through services like SendGrid or Mailchimp, based on attendee engagement and questions asked during the webinar.

- **Integrate Webinar Analytics with Dashboard Tools**: Collect attendance and interaction data from eWebinar, then feed it into a data visualization tool like Google Sheets or Data Studio. This allows for real-time monitoring of webinar performance metrics.
