# Overview

The SimpleKPI API enables users to programmatically manage and access their key performance indicators (KPIs), providing an interface for operations like retrieving KPI data, updating KPI values, and managing users and reports. Leveraging the SimpleKPI API within Pipedream, you can create powerful, serverless workflows that automate the tracking and reporting of performance metrics, integrate with other apps to enrich your KPI data, or trigger actions based on performance thresholds.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated KPI Reporting to Slack**: Use the SimpleKPI API on Pipedream to fetch your latest KPI data and send automated reports directly to a Slack channel. This keeps your team updated with the latest performance numbers without manual intervention.

- **Performance-Triggered Email Alerts**: Set up a workflow where Pipedream monitors specific KPIs from SimpleKPI, and when a KPI crosses a certain threshold, trigger an email alert via SendGrid or another email service. This can be used for real-time alerts on critical business metrics.

- **Data Enrichment with CRM Integration**: Integrate SimpleKPI with a CRM like Salesforce. Use Pipedream to pull in sales data from Salesforce, calculate KPIs, and push the results back to SimpleKPI. This ensures that your KPIs reflect the most up-to-date data from your sales pipeline.
