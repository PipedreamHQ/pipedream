# Overview

The Coinbase Commerce API enables developers to seamlessly integrate cryptocurrency payments into their websites or applications. With this API, you can automate the process of creating charges, managing invoices, and tracking payments in various cryptocurrencies. Using Pipedream's serverless platform, you can connect Coinbase Commerce to 3,000+ other apps to streamline payment processing, trigger actions based on payment status, and track financial data across your business tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Invoice Generation & Payment Confirmation Emails**: Create a workflow that triggers whenever a new charge is created in Coinbase Commerce. Once the charge is detected, automatically generate an invoice using a service like QuickBooks, and send a payment confirmation email to the customer using SendGrid or Gmail once the payment is confirmed.

- **Sync Payment Data with Accounting Software**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for payment events from Coinbase Commerce. When a payment is successful, the workflow can log this transaction in your accounting software, such as Xero or FreshBooks, ensuring your financial records are always up-to-date without manual data entry.

- **Manage Inventory Based on Crypto Payments**: Connect Coinbase Commerce with an inventory management system like Shopify or WooCommerce. Use Pipedream to create a workflow that reduces stock levels once a cryptocurrency payment is successful, and if the stock hits a low threshold, automatically send a replenishment order to your supplier or notify your logistics team.
