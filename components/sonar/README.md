# Overview

The Purple Sonar API allows developers to quickly create custom audio processing applications. With its powerful and sophisticated algorithms, the API allows for a wide range of audio processing applications such as speech recognition, music analysis, audio processing, and more.

Here are some examples of what you can build with the Purple Sonar API:

- Speech Recognition & Synthesis: Create applications that are capable of recognizing and synthesizing user speech.

- Music Analysis: Analyze audio sources to identify patterns and extract harmonic content.

- Audio Processing: Manipulate various audio sources, such as applying effects and filters.

- Singing Voice Amplification: Make vocals louder and clearer for karaoke, EDM, and live performances.

- Automated Mixing/Mastering: Automatically mix/master multiple audio sources together.

- System Identification: Analyze audio signals and create audio-based systems that are capable of reacting in response to environmental changes.

- Speech Enrichment: Enhance the intelligibility of speech with noise cancellation, echo reduction, and volume equalization.
