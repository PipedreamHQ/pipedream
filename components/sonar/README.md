# Overview

The Purple Sonar API allows developers to quickly create custom audio
processing applications. With its powerful and sophisticated algorithms, the
API allows for a wide range of audio processing applications such as speech
recognition, music analysis, audio processing, and more.

Here are some examples of what you can build with the Purple Sonar API:

- Speech Recognition & Synthesis: Create applications that are capable of
  recognizing and synthesizing user speech.
- Music Analysis: Analyze audio sources to identify patterns and extract
  harmonic content.
- Audio Processing: Manipulate various audio sources, such as applying effects
  and filters.
- Singing Voice Amplification: Make vocals louder and clearer for karaoke, EDM,
  and live performances.
- Automated Mixing/Mastering: Automatically mix/master multiple audio sources
  together.
- System Identification: Analyze audio signals and create audio-based systems
  that are capable of reacting in response to environmental changes.
- Speech Enrichment: Enhance the intelligibility of speech with noise
  cancellation, echo reduction, and volume equalization.
