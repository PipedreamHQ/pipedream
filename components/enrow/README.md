# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Orders to CRM**: When new orders come through on Enrow, automatically push them into your CRM system. This keeps your sales team informed and enables timely follow-ups or cross-selling opportunities.

- **Inventory Management**: Monitor product stock levels via Enrow and trigger alerts or reorder actions when inventory runs low. This workflow can connect to supplier systems to automate restocking and keep sales flowing without manual oversight.

- **Customer Review Solicitation**: After order fulfillment, use the Enrow API to trigger a sequence that reaches out to customers asking for product reviews. This could involve sending personalized emails or SMS messages, helping to build your reputation and provide valuable feedback.
