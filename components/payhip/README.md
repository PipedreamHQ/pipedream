# Overview

The Payhip API offers a suite of e-commerce capabilities, enabling automation for selling digital products, memberships, and physical goods. With Pipedream, you can leverage these capabilities to create customized workflows that respond to various Payhip events, such as new sales or product updates. These workflows can handle data manipulation, integrate with other services, or notify you or your team of important events.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Customer Follow-Ups:** After a sale on Payhip, use Pipedream to send a personalized thank you email to the customer via SendGrid. Then, schedule a follow-up email asking for feedback or offering a discount on future purchases.

- **Sync Sales Data with Google Sheets:** Capture new Payhip sales data in real-time and log it into a Google Sheet. This workflow helps maintain an up-to-date sales record, making it easier to analyze trends and generate reports without manual data entry.

- **Manage Inventory with Airtable:** When a product's stock changes on Payhip, use Pipedream to update the corresponding records in an Airtable base. This ensures that your inventory management is accurate and reflects current stock levels, helping to prevent overselling.
