# Overview

The Looker API provides programmatic access to Looker's data exploration functionalities, allowing you to tap into your data analytics and share insights across your organization dynamically. With the Looker API on Pipedream, you can automate reporting, synchronize analytics data with other apps, and trigger data-driven workflows. Whether it's scheduling reports, updating dashboards, or integrating data insights into other systems, the Looker API empowers you to make data-informed decisions efficiently.

# Example Use Cases

- **Scheduled Report Dispatch**: Configure a Pipedream workflow that triggers at regular intervals, fetches the latest reports from Looker, and sends them via email or Slack. This automation ensures stakeholders receive timely analytics updates without manual intervention.

- **Dashboard Activity Monitoring**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that uses the Looker API to monitor changes or views on specific dashboards. Whenever there's a significant change, the workflow could trigger notifications or log the event in a tool like Google Sheets or a project management app like Trello, helping teams stay aligned with the latest data insights.

- **Data Sync Between Looker and CRM**: Create a Pipedream workflow that regularly pulls data from Looker and updates the records in a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system like Salesforce. This ensures that sales and marketing teams have access to the latest data analytics for better customer engagement and personalized experiences.
