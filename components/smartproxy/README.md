# Overview

Smartproxy is a tool that grants you access to a vast pool of residential IPs, allowing you to scrape data, automate tasks, and bypass geolocation restrictions without getting blocked. It's valuable for tasks that require mimicking real user behavior and accessing web data with minimal footprint. On Pipedream, you can leverage the Smartproxy API to create workflows that automate these tasks, integrate with other services, and handle the data as needed, all in a serverless environment.

# Example Use Cases

- **Scrape Product Data**: Automate the extraction of product information from e-commerce websites while rotating proxies to prevent IP bans. You can trigger the workflow on a schedule, process the data, and store it in a Google Sheet for analysis.

- **Monitor Ad Campaigns**: Use Smartproxy to rotate your IP when checking ad campaigns for different geographical locations. This workflow can send the retrieved data to Slack to alert your marketing team in real time about the appearance and position of ads.

- **Aggregate News Content**: Create a serverless pipeline that fetches news articles from various international sources using Smartproxy to bypass geo-restrictions. The content can then be sent to an AI service like OpenAI for summarization, sentiment analysis, or categorization, and the results pushed to a database or a CMS.
