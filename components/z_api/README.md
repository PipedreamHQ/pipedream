# Overview

The Z-API API facilitates WhatsApp messaging automation, allowing users to send and receive messages, manage contacts, and orchestrate chatbots within the popular messaging platform. On Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create powerful serverless workflows that trigger actions in response to WhatsApp events, automate message flows, and integrate with myriad other services without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support Responses**: Connect Z-API to a CRM tool like HubSpot on Pipedream. When a new message comes into WhatsApp, trigger a workflow that checks the customer's details in HubSpot and sends a personalized reply or escalation based on their history.

- **Order Confirmation and Updates**: Sync Z-API with an e-commerce platform such as Shopify. After a customer places an order, use Pipedream to send an order confirmation via WhatsApp, and further send real-time order status updates as they occur.

- **Event Reminder Notifications**: Combine Z-API with Google Calendar on Pipedream. Set up a workflow that sends reminders to participants via WhatsApp for upcoming events or meetings, and updates them about any changes in schedule or location.
