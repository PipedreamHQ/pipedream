# Overview

The GetAccept API offers a suite of capabilities for automating and enhancing document workflow and e-signature processes. Within Pipedream's serverless environment, you can leverage the GetAccept API to create documents, send them for e-signature, track their status, and manage recipients. By integrating GetAccept with other apps on Pipedream, you can build powerful workflows to streamline how your business handles agreements, sales proposals, and contracts.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Document Workflow**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a new lead is added to your CRM like Salesforce. Automatically generate a sales agreement using GetAccept, send it to the new lead for signing, and update the lead's status in your CRM upon completion.

- **Contract Renewal Reminders**: Set up a scheduled Pipedream workflow that checks for contracts nearing their expiration date. Automatically send a reminder to your customer to renew their contract through GetAccept, and upon acknowledgement, update your internal databases or notify your team via apps like Slack.

- **Event-Driven Document Updates**: When a document's status changes to signed in GetAccept, trigger a Pipedream workflow that updates related records in your project management tool, e.g., Asana. Then, send a personalized thank you email through SendGrid to the signer, and archive the final signed document in cloud storage like Google Drive.
