# Overview

Yotpo - Reviews & Ratings API empowers businesses to leverage customer feedback by managing and utilizing user-generated content. With this API, you can programmatically fetch reviews, respond to customer feedback, and analyze sentiment to improve products and services. Integrating it with Pipedream allows for automation of these tasks, streamlining the process of collecting and acting on customer insights.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Reviews to a Google Sheet for Analysis**: Automatically transfer new reviews from Yotpo to a Google Sheets document using a Pipedream workflow. This enables easy monitoring and analysis of customer feedback trends over time without manual data entry.

- **Trigger Email Campaigns Based on Review Ratings**: Set up a workflow that triggers a specific email campaign from a marketing platform like Mailchimp when a review with either a high or low rating is received. High ratings could trigger a "thank you" campaign, while low ratings might start a customer service follow-up sequence.

- **Post Top Reviews to Social Media**: Create a Pipedream workflow that filters and posts 5-star reviews to your company's social media channels, such as Twitter or Facebook, using their respective APIs. This can automatically highlight positive customer experiences, boosting social proof and brand reputation.
