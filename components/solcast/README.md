# Overview

The Solcast API offers solar energy forecasting and historical solar data, enabling developers to integrate accurate solar radiation, PV power output, and weather data into their applications. With the Solcast API on Pipedream, you can automate data retrieval for solar project planning, performance monitoring, and energy system integration. Pipedream's serverless platform means you can set up workflows that respond to various triggers to process and act on Solcast data in real-time, without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Solar Power Generation Forecasting**: Automate the retrieval of solar power forecasts for multiple locations and feed this data into a database or analytics tool. This can be used for optimizing energy usage and storage or preparing the grid for changes in solar power supply.

- **Solar Data Aggregation for Smart Homes**: Collect solar radiation and PV power output data to manage smart home energy systems efficiently. Use this data to control home appliances, battery storage systems, and even to automate the sale of excess energy back to the grid.

- **Weather Impact Analysis on Solar Panels**: Trigger workflows to analyze the impact of weather events on solar panel efficiency. Combine Solcast data with weather apps to alert maintenance teams about necessary inspections or cleaning, ensuring the maximum efficiency of solar installations.
