# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing Workflow**: When a new sale is recorded in an e-commerce platform like Shopify, automatically create an invoice in Pennylane. This workflow can then update inventory and send a real-time notification to the finance team via Slack, ensuring that all departments are synchronized with the latest transaction data.

- **Expense Tracking and Reporting**: Configure a workflow that monitors company credit card transactions through a banking API. Each transaction can be logged as an expense in Pennylane, categorized, and tagged. Monthly expense reports can be automatically generated in Pennylane and sent to department heads through email, facilitating faster and transparent expense management.

- **Payroll Automation**: Integrate Pennylane with a HR platform like BambooHR. Each time a new employee is added in BambooHR, the workflow can create corresponding payroll entries in Pennylane. It can also handle changes like salary updates or bonuses, ensuring that payroll records are always accurate and up-to-date without manual intervention.
