# Overview

The Appointedd API enables you to manage bookings, resources, services, and customers within the Appointedd platform programmatically. Integrating with Pipedream allows you to automate these tasks, connect with multiple apps, and streamline your scheduling and business workflows. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can harness Appointedd's capabilities to trigger workflows on specific events, sync data across platforms, or handle complex scheduling logic without writing extensive code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Booking Confirmations**: Send personalized confirmation emails via SendGrid or Gmail when a new booking is made through Appointedd. Use Pipedream to listen for new booking events and automatically trigger an email confirmation with details.

- **Sync Appointments to Google Calendar**: Keep your Google Calendar in sync with Appointedd bookings by creating a Pipedream workflow that adds new Appointedd appointments to your Google Calendar and updates them if any changes occur in Appointedd.

- **Customer Follow-Up Surveys**: After an appointment is completed, trigger a workflow to send a follow-up survey to the customer using Typeform or Google Forms. Use Pipedream to detect when an appointment's status changes to completed and then send a survey link to gather feedback.
