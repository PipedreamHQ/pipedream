# Overview

The kwtsms API provides SMS services that allow you to send text messages globally. Integrating this API with Pipedream can make your workflows smarter by incorporating SMS notifications, alerts, and marketing communications.

- **Appointment Reminders**: Set up a workflow that sends SMS reminders to clients for upcoming appointments. This can be linked with Google Calendar events in Pipedream, ensuring clients receive timely notifications.

- **System Outage Alerts**: Create a rapid alert system that texts IT staff when system downtime is detected. Pair kwtsms with monitoring apps like Datadog in Pipedream to notify when there's an issue that needs immediate attention.
