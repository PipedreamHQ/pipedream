# Overview

The Triggre API offers a gateway to interact with the Triggre platform, enabling you to automate processes, manage data, and integrate with other services. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to create powerful serverless workflows, connecting Triggre with numerous other apps to streamline operations, trigger actions based on events, and manipulate data in real-time. This empowers you to build custom, automated solutions that bridge the gap between Triggre and the rest of your tech stack.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Order Processing**: When an order is placed in Triggre, a Pipedream workflow can automatically send the order details to a fulfillment service like ShipStation, update inventory in a system like Shopify, and send a confirmation email to the customer using SendGrid.

- **Sync Customer Data**: On a new customer signup in your Triggre app, trigger a Pipedream workflow to add or update the customer's information in a CRM like Salesforce, subscribe them to a Mailchimp campaign, and send a personalized welcome message through Twilio SMS.

- **Handle Support Tickets**: For every new support request submitted via Triggre, use a Pipedream workflow to create a ticket in a helpdesk system like Zendesk, notify the support team on Slack, and log the issue in a Google Sheets document for tracking and analysis.
