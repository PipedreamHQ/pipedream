# Overview

The Simplero API provides a gateway to interact with Simplero's comprehensive platform for information publishers, allowing you to automate tasks related to courses, memberships, and digital products. With the API, you can manage contacts, subscriptions, products, and content, offering a means to integrate Simplero's functionalities with other services and internal systems. Via Pipedream, you can craft serverless workflows that trigger from a variety of events and connect Simplero with hundreds of other apps to streamline your digital product sales, course enrollment processes, and customer engagement strategies.

# Example Use Cases
