# Overview

The Dreamhost API enables you to automate tasks related to your hosting account. This includes managing domains, DNS records, and email accounts, as well as accessing usage stats and billing information. With Pipedream, you can create serverless workflows that leverage the Dreamhost API to integrate with other services, respond to events, and automate your web hosting operations, all without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Domain Renewal Notifications**: Trigger an email or Slack message using Pipedream's built-in actions when a domain is nearing its renewal date as detected through the Dreamhost API.

- **Sync DNS Record Changes**: Whenever a DNS record is updated on Dreamhost, use Pipedream to sync the change across other platforms like Cloudflare or Route 53 to maintain consistent DNS configurations.

- **Monitor Hosting Usage and Billing**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream that triggers monthly, fetching hosting usage and billing data from Dreamhost, and then sends a formatted report to your finance team's email or a Google Sheets document.
