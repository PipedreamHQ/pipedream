# Overview

The Semaphore API lets you manage and control your CI/CD pipelines programmatically. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can build workflows that interact with Semaphore to automate tasks such as triggering deployments, fetching the status of pipelines, and more. You can trigger these workflows on a schedule, or in response to events, using Pipedream's event sources.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Deployment Triggering**: Combine GitHub and Semaphore on Pipedream to create a workflow that triggers a deployment after a successful push to a specific branch. This setup can streamline your deployment process, ensuring that your latest code is always deployed.

- **Real-Time Notifications**: Integrate Semaphore with Slack using Pipedream to send real-time notifications to your team. When a pipeline fails or succeeds, the workflow can post a message to a designated Slack channel, keeping everyone informed.

- **Conditional Pipeline Execution**: Use Pipedream to listen for webhooks from your project management tool (e.g., Jira). When a ticket moves to a "Ready for Deployment" status, it can trigger a workflow that checks conditions and initiates the Semaphore deployment pipeline if all criteria are met.
