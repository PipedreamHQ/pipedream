# Overview

The FluidForms API enables the customization and ordering of unique, made-to-order products directly from your applications. By integrating this API into Pipedream, you can automate the creation of custom products based on user inputs or events, streamline the ordering process, and connect these actions with various other services like CRM systems, payment gateways, or notification services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Onboarding Gifts**: Automatically generate and send personalized products to new customers as part of an onboarding process. When a new customer is added to a CRM like Salesforce, trigger a workflow in Pipedream that uses the FluidForms API to create and order a custom item with the customer's details.

- **Event-Driven Merchandising**: Create promotional products in real-time based on specific business events. For example, if a product on your eCommerce platform (like Shopify) hits a milestone number of sales, use Pipedream to trigger a FluidForms API call to design and produce limited edition merchandise celebrating the achievement.

- **Feedback-Driven Product Customization**: Collect customer feedback via tools like Typeform, and use it to customize products through the FluidForms API. Set up a Pipedream workflow that automatically processes survey responses to tailor products according to individual preferences and sends the custom order details back to FluidForms for production.
