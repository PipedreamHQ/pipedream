# Overview

Codemagic API offers a way to automate your mobile app development and delivery processes. By integrating with Pipedream, you can invoke workflows that react to events in your Git repository, automate build tasks, deploy applications, send notifications, and more. It's a powerful ally for developers looking to streamline the CI/CD pipeline for their mobile applications.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate App Builds on Git Push**: Trigger a Codemagic build whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of your app's repository. Use Pipedream's Git platform triggers to start the build process on Codemagic, ensuring your app is always up to date with the latest code.

- **Deploy Updates after Successful Builds**: After a successful build on Codemagic, use Pipedream to deploy the app automatically to app stores or distribution services. Connect to stores like Google Play or Apple App Store via their respective APIs to streamline your delivery process.

- **Slack Notifications for Build Status**: Set up a workflow that listens for build status updates from Codemagic and sends a message to a Slack channel with the results. This keeps your team informed about the build process, fostering quick feedback and action on build success or failure.
