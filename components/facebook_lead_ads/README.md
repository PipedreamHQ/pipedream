# Overview

The Facebook Lead Ads API allows you to integrate with Facebook's lead generation advertising features, enabling you to automate the retrieval of lead information and synchronize it with your business processes. Through Pipedream, you can harness this API to trigger workflows when new leads are captured, enrich lead data, connect to CRM systems, or initiate follow-up actions, providing a seamless bridge between your Facebook lead generation efforts and your sales or marketing tools.

## Example Use Cases

- **Instant Lead Follow-Up**: When a new lead is captured via Facebook Lead Ads, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends a personalized email to the lead using a service like SendGrid. This can help in engaging leads quickly and increasing conversion rates.

- **CRM Integration**: Automatically add new Facebook leads to a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. Each time a lead is received, Pipedream can create or update the lead's information in your CRM, ensuring your sales team has the latest data without manual entry.

- **Slack Notifications**: Keep your team instantly informed by sending a notification to a Slack channel whenever a new lead comes through Facebook Lead Ads. This can streamline communication and prompt immediate action on hot leads.
