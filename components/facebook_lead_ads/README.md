# Overview

The Facebook Lead Ads API allows for automated retrieval and integration of leads generated from Facebook Lead Ads into various business processes and systems. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to create serverless workflows that trigger actions based on new lead data, sync leads to CRMs, send personalized follow-up emails, and more, without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Leads to a CRM**: Automatically push new leads from Facebook Lead Ads to your CRM, like Salesforce or HubSpot, on Pipedream. This workflow can enrich lead data, assign them to sales reps, or trigger internal notifications.

- **Send Custom Email Responses**: When a new lead is captured on Facebook, use Pipedream to send a tailored email response through an email service such as SendGrid. This helps in engaging leads promptly and increases the chances of conversion.

- **Update Google Sheets with Lead Data**: Collect and organize new Facebook leads in a Google Sheet. This Pipedream workflow allows for easy sharing and analysis within a team, or for triggering further automations based on sheet updates.
