# Overview

The Screendesk API lets you automate customer support tasks directly within your apps or websites. Imagine streamlining interactions like ticket creation, response tracking, and support analytics. With Pipedream, you can easily craft workflows that interact with the Screendesk API to enhance customer support efficiency, trigger actions based on ticket status, or synchronize support data with other tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Ticket Creation from Emails**: Set up a workflow that monitors an email inbox for support requests using the built-in Pipedream Email trigger. When a new email arrives, parse the content and automatically create a ticket in Screendesk, ensuring no request goes unnoticed.

- **Sync Support Tickets with a CRM**: Maintain a seamless flow of information between Screendesk and a CRM like Salesforce. Anytime a new ticket is filed or updated in Screendesk, use Pipedreamâ€™s Salesforce app to reflect those changes in the CRM, keeping all customer interactions in sync.

- **Aggregate Support Metrics for Analytics**: Collect and send ticket metrics from Screendesk to a data visualization tool like Google Sheets or Data Studio. With a scheduled Pipedream workflow, you can regularly pull data from Screendesk and update your dashboards, giving you up-to-date insights on your support performance.
