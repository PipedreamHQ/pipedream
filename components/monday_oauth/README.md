# Overview

The monday.com API enables developers to programmatically interact with their monday.com workspace, allowing for automated workflows, data management, and integrations with other applications. Using Pipedream's serverless platform, you can leverage this API to create custom workflows that respond to board updates, manage items automatically, and connect monday.com with 3,000+ other apps.

You can connect your monday.com account in a few different ways:
1. Within the workflow builder, from a trigger or action step. Search for the monday.com app, and connect your account.
2. From the Pipedream Accounts [page](https://pipedream.com/accounts): Go to Accounts > Connect an app > Search for "monday.com".
3. Run the example Node JS code below by clicking "Connect monday.com and run", and choose a project and create an example workflow to interact with the monday.com API.

# Example Use Cases

- **Task Management Automation**: Automatically create and update tasks in monday.com when tickets are created in your support system. When a new support ticket comes in, Pipedream can capture the details and create a corresponding item in monday.com, keeping your team's task board current.

- **Project Status Updates**: Sync project statuses between monday.com and other project management tools. When a status changes in monday.com, Pipedream can update the corresponding project in tools like Jira or Asana, ensuring all systems remain synchronized.

- **Team Communication Integration**: Connect monday.com updates to your team communication platforms. When important changes occur in monday.com boards, Pipedream can send notifications to Slack or Microsoft Teams, keeping your team informed of critical updates.
