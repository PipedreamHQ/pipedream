# Overview

The monday.com (OAuth) API provides extensive capabilities to automate and enhance workflows, directly integrating with the monday.com platform. Utilize this API on Pipedream to create, update, retrieve, and manage tasks, projects, and team interactions systematically. By leveraging Pipedream's serverless execution model, developers can build scalable, event-driven automations that react in real time to changes in monday.com, or schedule jobs to run automatically.

# Example Use Cases

- **Project Management Automation:** Automate task assignments based on project updates. For instance, when a project status updates to "In Review" on monday.com, automatically assign a senior team member to review the project, and send a notification email via SendGrid detailing the pending review.

- **New Employee Onboarding:** Streamline the onboarding process for new employees. When a new employee record is added to a monday.com board, trigger workflows that automatically send welcome emails, schedule introductory meetings via Google Calendar, and create tasks for necessary training sessions.

- **Client Report Generation:** Automatically generate and send weekly project progress reports to clients. Set up a workflow where, every Friday, monday.com data summarizing the week's progress is fetched, compiled into a PDF report using a PDF generation API, and then emailed to the client using Gmail or another email service.
