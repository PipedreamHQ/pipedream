# Example Use Cases

- **Project Management Automation**: Automatically create tasks in monday.com when a new form is submitted on your website. This workflow can link tools like Typeform to monday.com, ensuring that every customer inquiry or project request is directly converted into a trackable task, improving response times and task tracking.

- **Sales Lead Tracking**: Create a workflow where new leads captured in a CRM like Salesforce are added as deals in a monday.com board. This automation can help sales teams track progress with visual boards and timelines directly from the initial capture in Salesforce, ensuring no lead is overlooked.

- **Customer Support Ticket Management**: Integrate monday.com with a customer support tool like Zendesk. Whenever a new ticket is created in Zendesk, a corresponding item can be added to a monday.com board. This allows support teams to track and manage tickets through monday.com's customizable workflows, enhancing response strategies and customer satisfaction.
