# Overview

The Mocean API provides tools for sending SMS and making voice calls, enabling you to integrate communication features into your applications or workflows seamlessly. With MoceanAPI on Pipedream, you can automate sending notifications, create alert systems, or even implement two-factor authentication (2FA). It interacts with other apps and services to craft powerful, event-driven automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **SMS Notifications for E-Commerce**: Automate order confirmation and dispatch notification via SMS to customers when their orders are processed in Shopify. Trigger a Mocean API action to send a text message directly from your Pipedream workflow whenever there's a new order or shipment in Shopify.

- **Voice Alert System for Monitoring Services**: Set up a server monitoring workflow that makes automated calls using Mocean API when a server's health check fails. This could be tied to incoming HTTP requests or scheduled checks in Pipedream, ensuring that you immediately know about any critical service disruptions.

- **Two-Factor Authentication for User Security**: Strengthen your app's security by adding 2FA. After a user login attempt, trigger a workflow that sends a one-time passcode via SMS through Mocean API. Integrate with Auth0 or another authentication service on Pipedream to verify the passcode and complete the authentication process.
