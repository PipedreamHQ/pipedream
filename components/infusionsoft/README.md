# Overview

The Keap (Infusionsoft) API is a powerful tool that unlocks advanced customer relationship management, marketing automation, and sales features. It allows you to manage contacts, create and update customer records, send emails, set up marketing campaigns, and more, automating and integrating these processes within your business workflows. With Pipedream's serverless execution environment, you can harness this API to craft custom automations, trigger sequences based on specific actions, and connect Keap to a multitude of other apps and services, streamlining your sales and marketing efforts.

# Example Use Cases

- **Contact Segmentation Workflow**: Sync new contacts from a Google Sheets spreadsheet to Keap. Each time a row is added to the spreadsheet, a Pipedream workflow can trigger, creating or updating a contact in Keap, tagging them based on specified criteria, and enrolling them in the appropriate marketing campaigns.

- **Lead Qualification and Alerting Workflow**: Connect Keap to Slack for instant notifications. When a new lead fills out a form on your website, Keap can capture their data; Pipedream then assesses the lead's score and sends a message to a dedicated Slack channel if the score is above a certain threshold, alerting your sales team to hot leads.

- **E-commerce Follow-Up Workflow**: After an order is placed using Shopify, use Pipedream to trigger a follow-up sequence in Keap. The workflow can check the customer's purchase history and, depending on the context (e.g., first-time buyer, repeat customer, high-value purchase), it can initiate personalized post-purchase follow-up sequences, request feedback, or offer loyalty discounts.
