# Overview

GoSquared offers a powerful analytics platform which, when integrated via its API, enables a deep dive into website traffic, user behavior, and real-time analytics. The API can be used to track events, fetch analytics data, manage contacts, and trigger communications based on user actions. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to create custom workflows that react to data from GoSquared, automate tasks, and connect with countless other apps for a seamless data pipeline.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-time User Activity Alerts**: Send custom notifications via Slack or email when a high-value user performs a specific action on your site. For example, receive an alert when a user who has previously made a purchase visits your pricing page.

- **Dynamic Audience Segmentation**: Automatically segment users in your CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot based on their activity tracked by GoSquared. This could involve tagging users who spend over a certain amount of time on your site or complete a specific action, allowing for targeted follow-up campaigns.

- **Automated Customer Support**: Trigger a support workflow in Zendesk or Intercom when GoSquared detects a user is struggling on a help page or has visited the support section multiple times without resolution, enabling proactive customer support engagement.
