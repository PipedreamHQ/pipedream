# Overview

The RealGeeks API offers a gateway to RealGeeks' real estate platform, allowing you to manage leads, properties, and agents programmatically. With the RealGeeks API on Pipedream, you can automate interactions with RealGeeks, such as syncing leads with other platforms, triggering actions based on property updates, and managing CRM activities. Pipedream's serverless platform enables you to create these workflows with minimal setup, using pre-built actions or custom Node.js code steps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Syncing Leads to a CRM**: Automatically transfer new leads from RealGeeks to a CRM like Salesforce. When a lead is created in RealGeeks, a workflow on Pipedream can capture that event and push the lead data into Salesforce, ensuring your sales team has immediate access to new opportunities.

- **Real-Time Notifications**: Get notified instantly when there's a new lead or a property status changes. Pipedream can listen for RealGeeks events and send alerts through email, SMS via Twilio, or a Slack message, keeping you or your team informed in real-time.

- **Email Campaign Trigger**: Initiate an email campaign with an email marketing service like Mailchimp when a new property is listed. With Pipedream, you can watch for new property listings in RealGeeks and automatically add that information to a Mailchimp audience, triggering a targeted email campaign.
