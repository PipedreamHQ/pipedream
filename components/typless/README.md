# Overview

The Typless API offers a streamlined solution for extracting data from documents using machine learning. With its capability, you can automate the process of pulling out specific information from various document types, such as invoices, receipts, or identity documents, turning unstructured data into structured and actionable data points.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing**: Streamline your accounts payable by setting up a workflow that triggers when an invoice is received via email. Pipedream can capture the email, leverage the Typless API to extract invoice data, and then populate this data into an accounting software like QuickBooks, effectively cutting down manual data entry.

- **Expense Management Automation**: Build a system where employees forward their receipts to a dedicated email address. Pipedream processes the incoming email, the Typless API extracts purchase details from the receipts, and then the data is inserted into an expense tracking tool like Expensify or a custom database, simplifying expense reporting.

- **Identity Verification Workflow**: Enhance your user onboarding process with an identity check. When a user uploads an ID document, Pipedream can catch the upload event, use Typless API to extract the user's details, and then feed this information into a background check service or your internal user management system to confirm identity, ensuring compliance and security.
