# Overview

The Typless API is designed to automate the extraction of data from various types of documents, such as invoices, receipts, or forms, with high accuracy. By leveraging optical character recognition (OCR) and machine learning, Typless can significantly streamline processes that traditionally require manual data entry. With Pipedream, you can integrate Typless into workflows that trigger actions in other apps based on the extracted data, enhancing automation and efficiency across various business functions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing**: Connect Typless to the Stripe API on Pipedream to automate invoice processing. When Typless extracts payment details and amounts from scanned invoice images, these data can trigger a workflow to create and send payment requests via Stripe, streamlining accounts receivable operations.

- **Expense Reporting Automation**: Use Typless with Google Sheets on Pipedream for automated expense reporting. Extract expense details from receipts and automatically populate a Google Sheet. This data can then be used to update expense reports, helping to manage budgets and financial reporting without manual data entry.

- **Customer Onboarding Documents**: Combine Typless with the Salesforce API on Pipedream to enhance customer onboarding processes. Automatically extract customer information from onboarding documents and use it to create or update customer profiles in Salesforce, ensuring accurate data entry and saving time during the onboarding process.
