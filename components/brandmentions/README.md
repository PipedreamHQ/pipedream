# Overview

The BrandMentions API lets you monitor and engage with online conversations about your brand in real-time. It provides insights into brand mentions across various channels, including social media, blogs, forums, and news sites. Pipedream serves as a powerful platform, enabling you to build automated workflows that respond to brand mentions, giving you the ability to track sentiment, identify influencers, and manage your brandâ€™s online reputation efficiently.

# Example Use Cases

- **Brand Reputation Management**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers whenever your brand is mentioned. You can filter mentions by sentiment, reach, or specific keywords, and then automatically log this data into a Google Sheet for analysis or send it to Slack for your team to review and act upon immediately.

- **Influencer Identification and Outreach**: Detect mentions from influential voices in your industry with the BrandMentions API on Pipedream. Once an influencer is identified, automatically send their details to a CRM like HubSpot or Salesforce, and create tasks for your marketing team to reach out for partnerships or collaborations.

- **Customer Support Enhancement**: Improve your customer support by integrating BrandMentions with a ticketing system like Zendesk through Pipedream. Automatically create support tickets when a negative mention is detected, ensuring that your support team can swiftly address customer concerns and manage potential crises before they escalate.
