# Overview

Syncro is an API that empowers users to streamline their customer support and feedback management by automating interactions and integrating with various systems. By leveraging Syncro with Pipedream, you can automate tasks such as syncing customer feedback to a CRM, triggering alerts based on feedback scores, or creating support tickets from customer responses. Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform facilitates the creation of these automated workflows without the need for complex infrastructure, making it straightforward to connect Syncro with other apps and services to enhance your customer support operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Feedback Collection to CRM**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream whenever a new feedback entry is submitted in Syncro. Use this trigger to create or update a customer record in a CRM like Salesforce, ensuring customer feedback is directly linked to the customer profile for personalized follow-up and service.

- **Support Ticket Creation from Negative Feedback**: Monitor feedback scores in Syncro and set a threshold for negative feedback. When a score falls below this threshold, automatically create a support ticket in a tool such as Zendesk or JIRA, ensuring prompt attention to dissatisfied customers and the opportunity to address their concerns quickly.

- **Real-Time Alerts for High-Priority Feedback**: Set up a workflow that sends real-time notifications through Slack, SMS, or email whenever a feedback response indicates urgent attention is needed, such as a critical product issue or a potential churn risk. This allows teams to react swiftly and prioritize issues that could impact customer satisfaction or business operations.
