# Overview

The Vitel Phone API allows you to integrate a suite of telephony services into your applications, enabling you to automate calls, manage voicemails, send text messages, and track communications. Leveraging Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows that react to events from Vitel Phone and connect them with 3,000+ other apps to streamline processes, alert teams, log activities, or even analyze call data for insights.

# Example Use Cases

- **Auto-Respond to Missed Calls**: If you miss a call on Vitel Phone, you can set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers an automatic text message or an email response to the caller. This way, you ensure prompt communication, even when you're not available to take the call.

- **Log Calls and Voicemails to CRM**: Integrate Vitel Phone with your CRM platform, such as Salesforce or HubSpot. Every time you receive a call or voicemail, Pipedream can capture the details and automatically update the customer's record in the CRM, keeping track of all interactions in one place.

- **Voice Command Actions**: Use Pipedream to trigger workflows based on specific voice commands during a call. For instance, when a keyword is mentioned, it could initiate a task in a project management tool like Trello or Asana, send a Slack notification, or log the event for future reference.
