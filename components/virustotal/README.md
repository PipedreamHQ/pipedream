# Overview

The VirusTotal API is a powerful online tool that allows developers to access
malware information, such as the prevalence of a specific file and the location
of any malicious URLs providers may have identified. With this API, users can
build a range of applications that can help warn their users of malicious
activity and protect them from viruses.

Here are some of the things you can build with the VirusTotal API:

- Monitor File Integrity: Visualize hashes of files over time, scan malicious
  files before downloading, and detect possible malicious file behavior.
- Scan Malicious URLs: Monitor any suspicious URLs registered in the VirusTotal
  database, and alert users when an URL is tagged as malicious.
- Uncover Malicious Behavior: Paired with other APIs, investigate events
  reported as malicious and inform users on any malicious behavior.
- Create Firewall Rules: Deny access to untrusted IPs and urls, blacklist them
  and analyze the source of any suspicious activity.
- Carry Out Instant Analysis: By using VirusTotal Scan, analyze suspicious
  content and get immediate response on any malicious material.
- Automate Incident Response: Use the APIs with your own incident response
  system to alert you when malicious content is identified and take immediate
  action.
