# Overview

The VirusTotal API offers a powerful interface to automate various aspects of security analysis and threat intelligence. With the API, you can scan files, URLs, domains, and IP addresses for malicious activity. Pipedream's serverless platform allows you to create workflows that can leverage this API to build custom security tools, automate threat detection, and integrate with other services for enhanced monitoring and alerting.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Malware Scanning for Email Attachments**: Use Pipedream to monitor an email inbox for new messages. When a new attachment is detected, automatically send it to VirusTotal for scanning. If the attachment is found to be malicious, trigger an alert and move the email to a quarantine folder.

- **Continuous URL Monitoring for Phishing Detection**: Create a Pipedream workflow that periodically checks URLs from a database or a list against the VirusTotal API. If a URL is flagged as a potential phishing site, automatically notify your team on Slack or through another communication app available on Pipedream.

- **Integrating Threat Intelligence into SIEM Solutions**: Streamline your security information and event management (SIEM) by using Pipedream to send new threat data from VirusTotal directly to your SIEM service, such as Splunk or a similar app on Pipedream. Keep your threat intelligence up-to-date and enhance your security response capabilities.
