### What Can You Build with the VirusTotal API?

The VirusTotal API is a powerful online tool that allows developers to access malware information, such as the prevalence of a specific file and the location of any malicious URLs providers may have identified. With this API, users can build a range of applications that can help warn their users of malicious activity and protect them from viruses.

Here are some of the things you can build with the VirusTotal API:

1. Monitor File Integrity: Visualize hashes of files over time, scan malicious files before downloading, and detect possible malicious file behavior.

2. Scan Malicious URLs: Monitor any suspicious URLs registered in the VirusTotal database, and alert users when an URL is tagged as malicious.

3. Uncover Malicious Behavior: Paired with other APIs, investigate events reported as malicious and inform users on any malicious behavior.

4. Create Firewall Rules: Deny access to untrusted IPs and urls, blacklist them and analyze the source of any suspicious activity.

5. Carry Out Instant Analysis: By using VirusTotal Scan, analyze suspicious content and get immediate response on any malicious material.

6. Automate Incident Response: Use the APIs with your own incident response system to alert you when malicious content is identified and take immediate action.
