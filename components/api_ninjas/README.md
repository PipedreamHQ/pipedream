# Overview

API Ninjas offers a wide-ranging collection of APIs that allow you to tap into various functionalities, like data retrieval, calculations, and text processing. On Pipedream, you can harness these capabilities to automate workflows, enrich data, and integrate with other services. The platform provides a serverless environment to trigger actions based on events, schedule tasks, and execute complex logic with minimal overhead.

# Example Use Cases

- **Data Aggregation for Market Research**: Build a workflow that periodically invokes the API Ninjas API to gather data on market trends, competitor prices, or other relevant market research data. Integrate this workflow with Google Sheets on Pipedream to store and analyze data, providing actionable insights for your business.
