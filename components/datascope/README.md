# Overview

DataScope is a versatile API for data collection and management, ideal for streamlining workflows that involve forms, surveys, or data entry. With DataScope, you can automate the consolidation of data gathered from various sources, analyze submissions in real-time, and trigger actions based on incoming data. Itâ€™s a powerhouse for anyone looking to digitize and automate paper-based processes, conduct field research, or collect structured data on the go.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Survey Data Aggregation**: Use DataScope to collect responses from surveys or forms. With Pipedream, you can automatically transfer these responses to a Google Sheets document for easy analysis and sharing. This workflow can be set to run every time a new response is received, ensuring your data is always up-to-date.

- **Customer Feedback to CRM Integration**: Gather customer feedback through DataScope forms. Pipedream can funnel this information into your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, like Salesforce or HubSpot. This helps keep customer data centralized, and allows for automated follow-up actions, such as triggering customer service processes or updating contact records with new insights.

- **Field Research Data Processing**: For field research data collected via DataScope, set up a Pipedream workflow to parse, validate, and store this data in a cloud database like AWS RDS or MongoDB. Additionally, Pipedream can send notifications to team members on Slack or via email when new data meets certain criteria, enabling prompt analysis and decision-making.
