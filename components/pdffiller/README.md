# Overview

pdfFiller API allows you to automate the process of filling, editing, and managing PDF documents entirely online. With this API, users can programmatically access and manipulate their documents, create templates, and implement e-signatures, which lends itself well to workflows involving legal documents, contracts, and various administrative forms. Leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can connect pdfFiller with hundreds of other apps to streamline document workflows, trigger actions based on document status, and synchronize data across platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Generation and E-Signature Process**: With pdfFiller and DocuSign integrated via Pipedream, automatically generate contracts from templates when a new client is added in a CRM like Salesforce. Once the PDF is prepared, it can be sent for e-signature via DocuSign, and the signed contract can be automatically stored in cloud storage like Google Drive.

- **Dynamic Form Data Insertion from Webhooks**: Use Pipedream to capture data sent via webhooks from an e-commerce platform like Shopify every time a new order is placed. Automatically populate an invoice template in pdfFiller with the order details and email the PDF invoice directly to the customer using an email service like SendGrid.

- **Employee Onboarding Documents Management**: Automatically generate and manage employee onboarding documents when a new employee record is added to an HR system like BambooHR. Use pdfFiller API to fill out onboarding forms and then route them to the appropriate departments for approval and signatures, followed by storing the completed forms in a service like Dropbox.
