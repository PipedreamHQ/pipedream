# Overview

The pdfFiller API provides robust tools for managing PDF documents, including creating, editing, filling, and signing forms programmatically. With Pipedream, users can harness the power of pdfFiller to automate document workflows, integrate with various data sources, and enhance document management processes. This opens up a range of possibilities, from auto-filling forms based on incoming data to routing completed documents to the necessary stakeholders.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Generation**: Automatically generate contracts from templates stored in pdfFiller when a new deal is marked as won in a CRM like Salesforce. Use Pipedream to monitor the CRM for trigger events and populate the contract based on deal details, then send the PDF for signing directly from pdfFiller.

- **Employee Onboarding Documents**: Streamline the employee onboarding process by automatically creating and sending onboarding documents when a new employee record is added to an HR system like BambooHR. Customize each document with personal information from the HR system and route it through pdfFiller for completion and signatures.

- **Invoice Processing Workflow**: Automate the creation and distribution of invoices using pdfFiller whenever a new order is received in an e-commerce platform like Shopify. Fetch order details via Pipedream, create an invoice in pdfFiller, and email the completed invoice directly to the customer or to an accounting system like QuickBooks for record-keeping.
