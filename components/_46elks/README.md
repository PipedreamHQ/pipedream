# Overview

The 46elks API grants access to a powerful suite of telephony services including SMS, MMS, and voice calls. You can use Pipedream to automate interactions with this API, creating workflows that respond to incoming messages, initiate outbound communication, or integrate with other services for enhanced functionality. Whether you're setting up SMS alerts, automating voice responses, or facilitating customer support, the 46elks API on Pipedream can streamline these processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **SMS Customer Feedback Collection**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow when a customer sends an SMS to your 46elks number. Collect feedback, store it in a Google Sheet, and send a thank you reply via SMS, creating a seamless feedback loop.

- **Appointment Reminders**: Use a scheduled Pipedream workflow to fetch appointments from a Calendar app, send reminders as SMS through 46elks, and handle confirmations or rescheduling requests automatically.

- **Voice-Activated Order Status**: Build a workflow where a customer can call a 46elks phone number, enter their order ID, and the workflow fetches the order status from an e-commerce platform like Shopify. Then, use 46elks to relay that status back to the customer through a voice message.
