# Overview

With the Blockchain Exchange API, you can interact with the Blockchain Exchange platform programmatically to automate trading strategies, monitor market data, and manage accounts. This robust API allows you to execute trades, retrieve real-time and historical market data, and access account information within Pipedream's serverless platform. Pipedream provides a no-code, low-code environment where you can connect the Blockchain Exchange API with hundreds of other apps to create custom, automated workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time Trade Execution**: Trigger a workflow that executes a trade on Blockchain Exchange when a specific cryptocurrency reaches a certain price. Combine the API with the Pipedream Cron Scheduler to periodically check the price and execute trades at optimal moments.

- **Market Data Alerts**: Use the Blockchain Exchange API to monitor market data and send alerts. Set up a Pipedream workflow to watch for significant market changes and automatically notify you via Slack or send an email through SendGrid, ensuring you never miss an important market move.

- **Automated Portfolio Management**: Create a workflow that connects to Google Sheets and the Blockchain Exchange API to maintain an up-to-date portfolio. Automatically pull in balances and recent transactions, record them in a spreadsheet, and even calculate portfolio performance over time.
