# Overview

The Assembla API lets you tap into a robust project management platform, offering seamless automation opportunities for developers and teams. With it, you can automate ticket creation, track commits and merge requests, manage users, and synchronize project activities with other tools. It's a boon for boosting productivity and ensuring that your project's moving parts stay well-oiled and in sync.

# Example Use Cases

- **Ticket Management Automation**: Automatically create Assembla tickets from customer emails or support requests captured in apps like Zendesk or Intercom. This ensures that user-reported issues are promptly converted into actionable tasks for your dev team.

- **Commit Tracking for Compliance**: Set up a workflow that monitors every push to your repositories, logs them in a Google Sheet or a data store, and creates an Assembla ticket for review. A perfect way to maintain change logs for auditing and compliance purposes.

- **User Management Sync**: Whenever a new team member is added to your GitHub organization, use Pipedream to add them as a user in Assembla too, and assign them to the correct team space. Keep your user management in sync across platforms without lifting a finger.
