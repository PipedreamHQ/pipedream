# Overview

The AWeber API enables you to interact with your AWeber account data and
perform actions, such as creating and updating subscribers, retrieving campaign
statistics, and managing account preferences. You can use the API to build
applications that integrate with AWeber, such as a custom subscriber management
system or a campaign reporting tool.
