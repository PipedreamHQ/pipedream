# Overview

The AWeber API enables you to interact with your AWeber account data and perform actions, such as creating and updating subscribers, retrieving campaign statistics, and managing account preferences. You can use the API to build applications that integrate with AWeber, such as a custom subscriber management system or a campaign reporting tool.
