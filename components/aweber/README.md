# Overview

AWeber's API provides a suite of tools to automate email marketing efforts, enabling developers to manage subscribers, send emails, and track results programmatically. With the AWeber API on Pipedream, you can create custom workflows that react to various triggers and connect with other services to streamline your email campaigns, analyze performance, and enhance subscriber engagement.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Welcome Email Sequence**: Set up a workflow that triggers when a new user subscribes to your list on AWeber. Use Pipedream to send a series of personalized welcome emails over the first few days or weeks to onboard your new subscriber.

- **Subscriber Segmentation and Tagging**: Create a workflow that monitors subscriber interactions, such as link clicks or email opens. Based on these interactions, use the AWeber API to tag and segment users on Pipedream, ensuring they receive more targeted and relevant email content.

- **E-commerce Purchase Follow-up**: Integrate AWeber with Shopify (or another e-commerce platform) on Pipedream. Whenever a purchase is made, trigger an email sequence in AWeber that provides product usage tips, asks for reviews, and offers related products to increase customer retention and sales.
