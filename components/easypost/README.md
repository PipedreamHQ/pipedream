# Overview

The EasyPost API simplifies the shipping process by offering a suite of tools for rate shopping, label creation, tracking, and address verification. With Pipedream, you can automate these shipping tasks, integrate with various services (like e-commerce platforms or inventory systems), and streamline your logistics operations. Pipedream lets you build serverless workflows using EasyPostâ€™s API, enabling you to connect shipping data with other apps, react to shipment updates in real-time, and create custom notifications or reports.

# Example Use Cases

- **Order Fulfillment Automation**: When a new order comes in from an e-commerce platform like Shopify, you can use Pipedream to automatically create a shipping label with EasyPost. This workflow can capture the order details, calculate the best rate, generate a label, and update the order status with the tracking number.

- **Shipment Tracking Updates**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for webhook events from EasyPost for shipment tracking updates. The workflow can filter for specific status changes, like 'out for delivery', and send real-time notifications via SMS with Twilio or email through SendGrid to keep customers informed.

- **Address Verification System**: Before shipping orders, you can validate customer addresses using EasyPost's Address Verification API. Integrate this with a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot using Pipedream to ensure every address in your system is accurate, reducing the chances of failed deliveries and improving customer satisfaction.
