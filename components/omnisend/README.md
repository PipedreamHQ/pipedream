- **Update Contacts from Google Sheets**: If you manage customer information in Google Sheets, Pipedream can watch for changes in your sheet and automatically update your Omnisend contact list. Ideal for ensuring your marketing lists are always in sync with the latest data.

- **Aggregate Campaign Metrics to a Dashboard**: Use Pipedream to gather campaign performance data from Omnisend, such as open rates or click-through rates, and send that data to a business intelligence tool like Google Data Studio. This workflow helps you visualize your marketing campaign's success and make data-driven decisions.
