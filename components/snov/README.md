# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Generation to CRM Integration**: When a new domain is added to your monitoring list, use Snov to find relevant emails and then add them as contacts in your CRM, such as Salesforce or HubSpot, automatically. This keeps your CRM updated with fresh leads without manual data entry.

- **Email Verification and Customer Onboarding**: After a user signs up on your platform, employ Snov to verify the email address. Once verified, trigger a personalized onboarding email sequence through SendGrid. This ensures you're engaging with real users and provides a warm welcome to your service.

- **Event-Driven Outreach Campaigns**: Launch targeted email campaigns with Snov whenever a specific event occurs, like a user completing a purchase on your e-commerce platform. Integrate Snov with Shopify to capture event details, craft personalized follow-ups, and trigger a Snov email sequence to encourage repeat business or request feedback.
