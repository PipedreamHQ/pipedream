# Overview

The Moneybird API allows you to automate your finance and accounting tasks by enabling programmatic access to your Moneybird account. With the API, you can create invoices, manage contacts, record payments, and fetch financial reports. This integration with Pipedream allows you to streamline your financial operations by connecting Moneybird with other apps and services to automate workflows, sync data, and trigger actions based on financial events.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Creation and Delivery**: Using the Moneybird API on Pipedream, you can monitor new orders from your e-commerce platform (like Shopify) and automatically generate and send invoices in Moneybird. Once an order is detected, a Pipedream workflow can create an invoice and email it to the customer, without manual intervention.

- **Expense Tracking and Reporting**: Integrate Moneybird with a time-tracking app like Toggl to automate the recording of billable hours as expenses in Moneybird. As time entries are logged in Toggl, a Pipedream workflow can translate these into expenses in Moneybird, and at the end of the month, compile these expenses into a report that's sent to your email.

- **Payment Status Webhooks and Notifications**: With Pipedream, set up a workflow that listens for webhook events from Moneybird indicating payment status changes. Upon receiving a notification that a payment has been made, the workflow can trigger a Slack message to a designated channel, notifying your team in real time of the updated payment status.
