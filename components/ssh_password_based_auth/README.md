# Overview

The SSH (Secure Shell) API provides users with a secure and reliable way to
connect to a remote server. This can be used to connect to remote systems and
transfer data and files, as well as manage and configure remote systems. With
the SSH API, you can authenticate with a password-based authentication.

This is a powerful tool for managing remote systems and networks, providing a
secure and efficient way to access and manage resources. You can use the SSH
API to build the following applications and services:

- Remote Tunneling/Port Forwarding - Create secure tunnels over a network,
  allowing traffic to pass through a secure port.
- File Transfers - Move files securely to and from remote systems.
- System/Network Management - Manage and configure remote hosts, networks, and
  systems.
- Remote System Backup/Restore - Create secure backups of systems and networks,
  and restore them in case of an emergency.
- Scripting/Automation - Automate administrative and maintenance tasks.
- Secure Shell Hosting - Create and host secure shell servers, allowing users
  to connect securely to remote systems and networks.
- Secure Network Tunneling - Create secure tunnels over an existing network,
  allowing encrypted traffic to pass through.
- Secure Chat - Create secure chat servers, allowing users to communicate
  securely through an encrypted channel.
- Secure File Storage - Create secure file storage solutions, allowing users to
  store their data securely behind encryption.
- Secure VPN - Create secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) systems, allowing
  users to remotely connect securely to remote networks.
