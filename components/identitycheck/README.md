# Overview

The IdentityCheck API provides robust tools for real-time identity verification and fraud detection. Using this API, you can validate personal information against databases to confirm the authenticity of an individual's identity. This becomes crucial in sectors like finance, ecommerce, and regulatory compliance where verifying a user's identity is a prerequisite for conducting secure transactions and maintaining trust.

# Example Use Cases

- **Online Account Creation Verification**: Automate the process of verifying new usersâ€™ identities during account registration on your platform. When a new user registers, trigger a workflow that uses the IdentityCheck API to validate the user's provided information. If the information is verified, proceed with the account creation; if not, trigger a follow-up action that could involve additional verification steps or denial of the account creation.

- **E-commerce Transaction Approval**: Integrate IdentityCheck with your e-commerce platform to automate identity verification at checkout. Set up a workflow that triggers when users finalize their purchases. Use IdentityCheck to confirm the identity of the customer. If verified, proceed with the payment process; if the identity check fails, automatically halt the transaction and notify customer service.

- **Loan Application Processing**: In financial services, automate loan application processes by integrating IdentityCheck into your application workflow. When an application is submitted, trigger a workflow that employs IdentityCheck to verify the identity of the applicant. Based on the verification results, automatically route approved applications to the next step or flag those requiring further review.
