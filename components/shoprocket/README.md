# Overview

The Shoprocket API empowers you to seamlessly integrate e-commerce capabilities into your website or app. With Pipedream, you can connect Shoprocket to hundreds of other services to automate tasks like syncing orders to a database, updating inventory in real-time, or triggering custom email campaigns when a new product is added. Pipedream's serverless platform allows for building custom workflows that can react to various Shoprocket events, manipulate the data, and interact with numerous APIs and services without the hassle of managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Order Processing Automation**: When a new order is placed in Shoprocket, trigger a Pipedream workflow to validate the order details, then generate an invoice using the QuickBooks API, and finally send the invoice to the customer via SendGrid.

- **Real-Time Inventory Sync**: Keep your inventory up-to-date across multiple platforms. When inventory changes in Shoprocket, use a Pipedream workflow to instantly update stock levels in a connected ERP system like NetSuite and simultaneously send a Slack notification to the inventory management team.

- **Customer Follow-Up Campaigns**: After a purchase, automatically enroll customers in a follow-up campaign by triggering a Pipedream workflow that adds the customer's email to a Mailchimp list, sends a personalized thank you email, and schedules a series of tailored marketing emails aimed at repeat engagement.
