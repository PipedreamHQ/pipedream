# Overview

The OCRSpace API enables text extraction from images and PDFs, converting various image formats into editable and searchable data. This service is a game-changer for automating document handling processes, where the need to digitize content is crucial. Pipedream's platform allows for seamless integration of OCRSpace's capabilities with various apps to streamline workflows, such as organizing documents, populating databases, or even triggering event-driven actions based on the extracted content.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing**: Scan and extract data from uploaded invoices using OCRSpace, then use Pipedream to send the extracted data to accounting software like QuickBooks for reconciliation and archiving. This workflow can reduce manual data entry and speed up the accounting process.

- **Digital Document Archival System**: Convert paper documents into searchable text with OCRSpace. With Pipedream, you can then store the extracted text in a database like Airtable or Google Sheets, and even initiate a backup to cloud storage solutions such as Dropbox or Google Drive, creating an organized, searchable archive.

- **Event Registration Via Business Card Scans**: Use OCRSpace to gather contact information from scanned business cards at events. Pipedream can then automatically populate the data into a CRM like HubSpot or Salesforce, and trigger a follow-up email sequence via an email marketing platform like Mailchimp, enhancing lead management and engagement.
