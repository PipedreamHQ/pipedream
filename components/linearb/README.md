# Overview

The LinearB API serves as a bridge between LinearB's project management insights and your preferred platforms, offering the ability to automate workflows, generate reports, and trigger actions based on project metrics. With Pipedream, these capabilities can be harnessed to create custom workflows that respond to events within LinearB, such as changes in project status or team performance metrics. The data can be pushed to various services, such as communication tools, databases, or other project management apps to enhance visibility and coordination across your team.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync LinearB Project Updates to Slack**: Automatically post updates in a Slack channel whenever a new project is created or a project's status changes in LinearB. This keeps the entire team aligned and promptly informed about the project's progress.

- **Create LinearB Metrics Dashboard**: Use the LinearB API to fetch key performance metrics and pipe them into a Google Sheets document on a regular schedule. This allows teams to maintain a live dashboard that tracks project health and team productivity without manual data entry.

- **Trigger Incident Management on Status Change**: Set up a workflow that monitors project status changes in LinearB, and triggers an incident in PagerDuty when certain thresholds are met (like a project falling behind schedule). This ensures that stakeholders are alerted and can take immediate action to address project risks.
