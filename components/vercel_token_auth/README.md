# Overview

The Vercel API empowers developers to automate, manage, and interact with their Vercel projects and deployments directly through code. With the Vercel API on Pipedream, you can harness the power of serverless functions to create dynamic and responsive workflows. Automate deployment processes, sync deployment statuses with other tools, trigger notifications based on deployment events, or manage your domains and aliasesâ€”all within the seamless integration landscape of Pipedream.

# Example Use Cases

- **Deployment Trigger Notification**: Send a Slack message or an email via SendGrid whenever a new deployment is triggered in Vercel. This keeps teams instantly informed about development progress and deployment pipeline activity.

- **Automated Backup on Deployment**: Whenever a deployment to production is successful, back up the production database by triggering a serverless function that creates a snapshot and stores it in Amazon S3 or another cloud storage service. This ensures that there's always a recent backup available, safeguarding against data loss.

- **Performance Metrics Reporting**: After a deployment, invoke a workflow that fetches the latest deployment's performance metrics using the Vercel API and sends a report to DataDog, or a Google Sheet for further analysis and historical tracking. This helps in keeping a tab on the application's performance and the impact of each deployment.
