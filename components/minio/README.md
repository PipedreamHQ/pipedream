# Overview

MinIO offers a high-performance, S3-compatible object storage system which enterprises use for both private cloud storage and edge storage solutions. The Minio API allows you to programmatically manage buckets, objects, and configurations. Leveraging this API with Pipedream enables automated workflows that can handle large-scale data operations, backups, and event-driven file management seamlessly across different services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Backup to Google Drive**: When a new file is uploaded to a specific bucket in MinIO, the workflow automatically backs it up to Google Drive. This is crucial for data redundancy and ensures that your backups are stored in multiple locations.

- **Image Processing on Upload**: Every time a new image file is uploaded to a MinIO bucket, the workflow triggers an AWS Lambda function to process the image (e.g., resizing, format conversion). The processed image can then be stored back into MinIO or another storage service, streamlining the process of image management.

- **Real-time Data Sync to PostgreSQL**: Set up a workflow where each new MinIO object triggers a Pipedream workflow that parses the file (assuming it's CSV or JSON) and automatically inserts the data into a PostgreSQL database. This is particularly useful for businesses that need to quickly move data from storage into operational databases for immediate analysis.
