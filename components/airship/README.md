# Overview

The Airship API provides tools to engage customers across SMS, email, app notifications, and more. By leveraging this API, you can automate messaging based on user behavior, preferences, and lifecycle events. Integrating Airship with Pipedream allows you to connect these communication capabilities with hundreds of other services to build robust, automated workflows. This lets you craft personalized customer journeys, respond promptly to user actions, and monitor the effectiveness of different communication strategies.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Onboarding Automation**: Trigger a welcome email and app notification sequence when a new user signs up in your app. Use Airship to manage the messaging sequence and trigger emails or notifications based on specific user actions or time delays.

- **Behavior-Triggered Offers**: Send personalized offers via SMS or in-app messages when a user performs a significant action, like adding items to a cart but not completing a purchase. Connect Airship with an e-commerce platform like Shopify to monitor cart status and trigger timely messages aimed at conversion.

- **Event-Driven Feedback Collection**: Collect feedback through email or mobile messages post-event or interaction. Set up a workflow where Airship sends a feedback request after a customer attends a webinar or a major event, using webinar platforms like Zoom or event management systems to trigger the communication.
