# Overview

Roam Research API allows you to automate and enhance your note-taking and data management within Roam Research, a networked note-taking application. With its API, developers can programmatically interact with their Roam database, extract information, and manipulate their notes. When combined with Pipedream, this capability expands, enabling integration with numerous other applications and services, automating workflows, and syncing data across platforms effortlessly. This connection can lead to significant productivity improvements, such as automated content updates, data synchronization, and enhanced collaboration.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Daily Journal Creation**: - Automatically create a new daily journal page in Roam Research at the start of each day using a Pipedream scheduled workflow. This can help maintain a consistent journaling habit without the need to manually create a new page every day.

- **Sync Tasks from Todoist to Roam Research**: - Sync tasks from Todoist to Roam Research as to-do items. Each time a task is added or completed in Todoist, a Pipedream workflow triggers an update or creates a new entry in Roam Research. This ensures your tasks and notes are always in sync, enhancing your productivity tools ecosystem.

- **Content Backup to Google Drive**: - Automatically back up your Roam Research pages to Google Drive at scheduled intervals. With a Pipedream workflow, export your Roam Research pages as markdown files and save them to a specified folder in Google Drive, providing an additional layer of data security and accessibility.
