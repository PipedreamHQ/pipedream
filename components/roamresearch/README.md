# Overview

Roam Research API on Pipedream allows developers to automate interactions with Roam Research, a networked note-taking app for organizing and managing knowledge. Using this API, you can create, read, update, and delete notes programmatically, enabling seamless integration with other apps and services. This integration is perfect for automating data entry, syncing notes across platforms, and triggering workflows based on note creation or modification.

# Example Use Cases

- **Daily Notes Sync**: Automate the syncing of daily notes from Roam Research to a Google Calendar. Each note tagged with a specific keyword in Roam can be set to create an event in Google Calendar, helping you keep track of tasks and deadlines directly from your calendar.

- **Content Backup**: Set up a daily or weekly backup of all your Roam Research pages to a Dropbox folder. This workflow ensures that every change or addition to your notes is safely backed up outside of Roam, providing an extra layer of data protection.

- **Task Management Integration**: Create a workflow that automatically sends tasks created in Roam Research to a Trello board. Each bullet or todo in Roam can be set to generate a Trello card, categorizing and prioritizing tasks efficiently in a visual task management tool.
