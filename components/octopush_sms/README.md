# Overview

The Octopush SMS API lets you programmatically send text messages, providing a powerful way to reach out to customers directly on their phones. With Pipedream, you can create workflows that trigger SMS sending via Octopush based on various events, streamlining communication processes. You could use this API to send alerts, reminders, verification codes, or marketing messages, and integrate with other apps to respond to emails, form submissions, or updates in a CRM.

# Example Use Cases

- **SMS Alerts for Critical System Outages**: When a monitoring system like Datadog detects an outage or critical system issue, it can trigger a Pipedream workflow to send an immediate alert via Octopush SMS to your on-call engineers, reducing response times.

- **Appointment Reminders from Google Calendar**: Set up a workflow where upcoming Google Calendar events trigger SMS reminders through Octopush. This keeps clients or patients informed about their appointments, potentially cutting down on no-shows.

- **E-commerce Order Confirmations**: Whenever a new order is placed in an e-commerce platform like Shopify, a Pipedream workflow can automatically send an order confirmation and updates via SMS through Octopush, enhancing customer experience.
