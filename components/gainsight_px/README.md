# Example Use Cases

- **User Engagement Trigger Based on Product Usage**: Trigger personalized emails or in-app messages using Gainsight PX when a user reaches certain milestones in your product. For example, if a user adds their 10th project on your platform, automate an in-app message or email congratulating them and suggesting further actions, using integrations with email platforms like SendGrid or messaging services like Slack.

- **Onboarding Workflow Automation**: Automate the onboarding process by using Gainsight PX to track completion of onboarding steps. Trigger specific actions in other apps like sending a welcome kit via a service like Sendoso or unlocking additional features within your platform when a new user completes their profile setup or achieves their first key action in the product.

- **Proactive Support Tickets Creation**: Monitor user frustration signals via Gainsight PX, such as multiple failed attempts to use a feature or negative feedback within the product. Automatically create support tickets in helpdesk platforms like Zendesk or Freshdesk, alerting support teams to reach out proactively and assist the user, potentially reducing churn and boosting satisfaction.
