# Overview

Gainsight PX, a product experience platform, enables companies to gather insights on user behaviors and drive engagements directly within their software products. The API facilitates the integration of event tracking, user properties updates, and in-app messages without the need for UI interaction. On Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate user engagement processes, sync user data across platforms, or trigger targeted actions based on user activities.

# Example Use Cases

- **User Onboarding Automation**: Automate the user onboarding journey by triggering personalized in-app messages or emails based on user behavior and milestones achieved in your app. For instance, when a new user signs up and completes key features, you can use Gainsight PX to deliver tailored tutorials or help prompts to ensure they get the most out of your product.

- **Event-Driven Email Campaigns**: Integrate Gainsight PX with email platforms like SendGrid on Pipedream. Set up workflows where specific user interactions within your app trigger targeted email campaigns. For example, if a user engages with a feature several times but doesnâ€™t utilize it to its fullest, trigger a helpful tips email to encourage deeper engagement.

- **Churn Risk Identification and Mitigation**: Use Gainsight PX to monitor user activity patterns that indicate a risk of churn, such as reduced login frequency or feature usage. Set up a Pipedream workflow to automatically notify your customer success team or trigger an in-app survey to gather feedback and address issues proactively.
