# Overview

The Team Up API allows you to interact with your Team Up calendars programmatically, enabling the automation of event creation, updates, and deletion, as well as the retrieval of calendar data. By integrating the Team Up API with Pipedream, you can build workflows that trigger on specific events, automate tasks, and connect your calendar data with countless other services, bringing efficiency to team coordination and event management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Event Creation from Emails**: Create a Pipedream workflow that triggers when a new email arrives in your Gmail inbox with a specific subject line. Extract event details from the email and use the Team Up API to add a new event to your calendar.

- **Slack Notifications for Upcoming Events**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that runs periodically, checks your Team Up calendar for upcoming events within the next 24 hours, and posts reminders in a designated Slack channel, keeping your team informed and prepared.

- **Syncing Team Up with Google Calendar**: Build a workflow on Pipedream that triggers when a new event is added to your Team Up calendar. Use this trigger to then create a corresponding event in Google Calendar, ensuring that your schedules are synchronized across different calendar platforms.
