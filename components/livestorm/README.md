# Overview

The Livestorm API opens up a world of possibilities for event management automation. With this API, you can harness data from your webinars and online events to drive engagement, personalize follow-ups, and streamline event operations. Integrating Livestorm with Pipedream allows you to construct workflows that can react to event triggers, sync data across platforms, and automate repetitive tasks. Whether you're looking to enhance participant engagement, capture leads in your CRM, or trigger personalized email campaigns post-event, Pipedream's serverless platform makes it easy to connect Livestorm with other apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Event Follow-Up Emails**: Craft personalized follow-up emails to attendees right after an event ends, using attendee data from Livestorm. Set up a workflow on Pipedream that triggers when an event concludes, fetching attendee details and sending customized emails via SendGrid or another email service.

- **Sync Webinar Leads to CRM**: Whenever a new participant registers for a webinar, automatically add their information to your CRM. Pipedream can trigger a workflow on new registrations, pushing data to Salesforce, HubSpot, or another CRM platform, helping your sales team to act on fresh leads without delay.

- **Post-Event Survey Distribution**: Distribute a post-event survey to collect feedback from participants. Set up a workflow that triggers at the end of an event to send out a survey link through Twilio SMS or via email, ensuring timely feedback that can be used to improve future events.
