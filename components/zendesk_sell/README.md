# Overview

The Zendesk Sell API enables automated interactions with your sales CRM data, facilitating enhancements in sales processes through custom automation and integration with other services. Using Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create workflows that streamline sales operations, enhance customer engagement, and improve data management, all in real-time. With Pipedream's serverless platform, these automations can run in response to events, on a schedule, or on-demand, without the need for your own infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Leads to Mailchimp for Automated Email Campaigns**: When a new lead is added in Zendesk Sell, trigger a workflow that automatically adds or updates this lead in a Mailchimp audience. This ensures your email marketing campaigns are consistently targeting new leads, enhancing the chances of conversion through timely and relevant communication.

- **Create Support Tickets from High-Value Opportunities**: Configure a workflow that watches for opportunities marked as 'high value' in Zendesk Sell. When such an opportunity is updated or created, automatically create a support ticket in a tool like Zendesk Support or Jira to ensure the customer receives VIP treatment, potentially increasing the likelihood of a successful close.

- **Daily Sales Report Generation and Distribution**: Set up a daily scheduled workflow in Pipedream that pulls the previous day's sales data from Zendesk Sell, formats it into a report, and sends this report via email or posts it to a Slack channel. This keeps the whole team informed and aligned on sales progress, allowing for quick adjustments and targeted discussions.
