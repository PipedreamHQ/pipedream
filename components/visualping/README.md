# Overview

VisualPing is a tool that lets you monitor web pages for changes. Using its API with Pipedream, you can automate reactions to those changes. For instance, you can set up workflows that notify you or your team when specific parts of a web page update, or use changes to trigger downstream actions in other apps. Pipedream's serverless platform enables you to connect VisualPing with a vast array of apps to create custom, automated workflows without writing a lot of code.

# Example Use Cases
