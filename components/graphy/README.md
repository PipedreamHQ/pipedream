# Overview

Graphy is an API designed to help businesses create customizable and collaborative dashboards and reports. Integrating Graphy with Pipedream allows for seamless automation of data visualization workflows, where you can trigger actions based on events, sync data across various apps, or even manage your dashboard's content programmatically. Pipedream's serverless platform provides you with the ability to connect Graphy to 3,000+ other apps to enhance your reporting and analytics processes without writing extensive code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Dashboard Updates**: Set up a workflow that listens for updates in a Google Sheets document. Whenever a change is detected, the workflow can trigger an update to a specific Graphy dashboard, ensuring your visualizations always reflect the latest data.

- **Slack Notification for Metrics**: Create a workflow that regularly checks certain metrics in Graphy. If a metric crosses a predefined threshold, send an alert to a Slack channel to prompt immediate action or discussion among your team members.

- **Event-Driven Report Generation**: Implement a workflow where, upon receiving a webhook from a CRM like HubSpot after a new deal is closed, a detailed performance report is automatically generated in Graphy and shared via email with stakeholders.
