# Overview

The Retriever API is designed for automating contact information retrieval, enriching your CRM data, or building lead generation tools. By integrating it with Pipedream, you can strategically extract valuable data and automate workflows for marketing, sales, or customer support. Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform enables you to connect Retriever with hundreds of other apps, triggering actions based on new data, or updating systems in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contact Syncing in Marketing Campaigns**: Sync contact details between your marketing platforms and Retriever. When a user signs up via a platform like Mailchimp, use Pipedream to trigger Retriever to gather more info and update the user profile, personalizing your marketing efforts.

- **Customer Support Ticket Enrichment**: Enhance the customer support experience by providing more context to support agents. When a new support ticket is created in tools like Zendesk, use Pipedream with Retriever to pull in additional customer data, equipping agents with a fuller picture to resolve issues efficiently.
