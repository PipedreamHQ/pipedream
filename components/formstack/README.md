# Overview

The Formstack API facilitates the automation of form creation and submission processes, enhancing data collection and integration. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can trigger workflows on form submissions, manipulate and route form data to various endpoints, and seamlessly connect Formstack with other apps to streamline tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Dynamic CRM Lead Entry**: Automatically create leads in Salesforce whenever a form is submitted on Formstack. Use data from the form to populate the lead details, ensuring that potential customer information is immediately captured and ready for follow-up by the sales team.

- **Custom Email Notifications**: Craft and send personalized email notifications using SendGrid when a Formstack submission occurs. Tailor the content based on the submission data to provide respondents with relevant information, confirmation messages, or next-step instructions.

- **Support Ticket Creation**: Integrate Formstack submissions into a Zendesk support system. When a customer submits a feedback or support form, a new ticket is generated in Zendesk, with all the pertinent information from the form directly mapped to the ticket fields, streamlining your support workflow.
