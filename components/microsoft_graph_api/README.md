# Overview

The Microsoft Graph API taps into the rich data and insights generated by Microsoft 365 services. It enables developers to build powerful workflows integrated with email, calendars, contacts, documents, directory services, and device updates. With Graph API, you can automate user account management, extract insights from Office 365 usage, manage devices, and leverage AI services to mine data from the Microsoft ecosystem.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Email Campaigns with Microsoft Graph API and SendGrid**: Create a workflow that triggers a personalized email campaign using SendGrid whenever there's a new event on a user's Outlook calendar. This is perfect for follow-up communications after meetings or events.

- **Sync Microsoft To-Do Tasks with Trello for Project Management**: Develop an integration that automatically syncs tasks added to Microsoft To-Do with a Trello board. This workflow ensures that project tasks are up-to-date across both platforms, aiding in seamless project management and collaboration.

- **Streamline User Onboarding with Microsoft Graph API and Slack**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for new users added in Azure Active Directory, and then posts a welcome message in a designated Slack channel. Additionally, it can trigger a series of onboarding tasks like provisioning new accounts in other services or enrolling users in training modules.
