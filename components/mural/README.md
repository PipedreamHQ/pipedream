# Overview

The Mural API allows users to automate and integrate collaborative design workflows directly in a digital workspace. By using this API with Pipedream, users can programmatically manage murals, rooms, memberships, and more, enabling dynamic interactions and automations based on events within Mural or connected apps. This integration can streamline processes such as project setup, feedback loops, and real-time updates across teams.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Project Kickoff**: When a new project is created in a project management tool like Asana, automatically create a corresponding room and initial mural in Mural. Populate the mural with predefined templates relevant to the project type to kickstart the brainstorming process.

- **Real-Time Feedback Collector**: Set up a workflow where new comments or inputs on a Mural trigger notifications via Slack. This ensures immediate feedback to the team and keeps everyone updated without needing them to constantly check Mural for changes.

- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Integrate Mural with Google Calendar to manage project timelines and meetings. Whenever a new mural is finalized, a corresponding event can be automatically scheduled in Google Calendar, inviting all project stakeholders to review the final outputs or to commence the next phase of the project.
