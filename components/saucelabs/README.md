# Overview

Sauce Labs API lets you automate your web and mobile app testing. This means you can create, manage, and run tests programmatically on different browsers and devices, gather results, and tap into Sauce Labs' extensive browser/device coverage without manual intervention. With Pipedream, you can connect Sauce Labs to a wide array of other services to streamline your testing pipeline, react to testing events in real-time, and integrate test outcomes into your CI/CD workflow, issue tracking, or notification systems.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Test Execution after Code Commits**: Trigger a suite of automated tests on Sauce Labs when new code is committed to a GitHub repository. Use Pipedream's GitHub trigger to start Sauce Labs tests and then handle results with subsequent steps.

- **Monitor Test Results and Notify Teams**: Set up a workflow that listens for completed tests on Sauce Labs, parses the results, and sends a formatted report to Slack, email, or another communication platform to keep your team informed.

- **Integrate Test Outcomes with JIRA**: After tests are completed in Sauce Labs, use the results to create or update JIRA issues automatically. This can help in tracking bugs or test failures directly within your project management tool.
