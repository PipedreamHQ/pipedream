# Overview

The ExpoFP API enables developers to integrate floor plan management and interaction within their applications. With this API, you can access detailed information about exhibition spaces, including booth details, exhibitor information, and floor plan layouts. When you combine ExpoFP with Pipedream's serverless integration and compute platform, you can automate event management tasks, synchronize floor plan data with other systems, and enhance visitor engagement by connecting with CRM or marketing automation tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Event Registration Sync**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that triggers when a new exhibitor registers for an event via your CRM. The workflow would automatically assign a booth on the ExpoFP floor plan and update the CRM with the booth number, ensuring seamless coordination between sales and event layouts.

- **Real-Time Notifications for Floor Plan Changes**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for updates to floor plans on ExpoFP. Whenever a change is detected, the workflow could send real-time notifications to event managers or exhibitors via Slack, email, or SMS, keeping all stakeholders informed about the latest layout.

- **Analytics Integration for Visitor Tracking**: Design a Pipedream workflow that integrates ExpoFP with analytics platforms like Google Analytics. Track visitor interactions with the floor plan—such as booth clicks or views—and feed this data into your analytics system to gain insights into visitor behavior and preferences, enabling data-driven decision making for future events.
