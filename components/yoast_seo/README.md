# Overview

The Yoast SEO API enables automation of SEO tasks and retrieval of data to optimize website content for search engines directly through Pipedream. Connect the Yoast SEO API to analyze pages, manage metadata, and improve search rankings. Pipedream's serverless platform makes it easy to build complex workflows linking Yoast SEO with other services, triggering actions based on content changes, SEO scores, or other criteria.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Audit Workflow**: Automatically fetch the SEO scores of published blog posts from Yoast SEO and create a report in Google Sheets. Use this workflow to identify posts that need optimization and track changes over time.

- **SEO Alerts via Slack**: Set up a workflow where Pipedream monitors your site's SEO health through Yoast SEO API. If a critical issue is detected, such as a drop in keyword rankings or missing metadata, an alert is sent to a designated Slack channel, prompting immediate action.

- **Automated SEO Recommendations**: Combine Yoast SEO with a machine learning API to analyze content and generate SEO recommendations. When a new post is drafted in WordPress, trigger a Pipedream workflow that runs it through Yoast SEO and a machine learning model to suggest improvements before publication.
