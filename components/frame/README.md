# Overview

The Frame.io API hooks into their robust video collaboration platform, enabling automated workflows around video reviews, project updates, and asset management. With the API, you can programmatically interact with comments, accounts, projects, and moreâ€”perfect for integrating with other tools to streamline video production pipelines.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Feedback Collection**: When a new comment is made in Frame.io, trigger a Pipedream workflow that aggregates feedback and sends a formatted digest to Slack, ensuring immediate team visibility.

- **Project Progress Tracking**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for changes in project status on Frame.io. When a project moves to the next stage, the workflow can update a corresponding task in Asana and notify the team.

- **Asset Backup and Archival**: Create a Pipedream workflow that responds to the upload of new assets to Frame.io, automatically backing them up to Google Drive or Dropbox, providing a secondary storage solution for important files.
