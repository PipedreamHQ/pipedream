# Example Use Cases

Then, use Pipedream to send a customized email with the invoice attached to the customer, enhancing the efficiency of transaction processing.

- **Expense Management on Slack**: Whenever a new expense is recorded in Clear Books, trigger a Pipedream workflow that posts a notification in a specified Slack channel. This keeps teams immediately updated about new financial commitments, aiding in budget management and financial transparency within the organization.

This can be scheduled to run automatically, providing consistent updates and historical data tracking for analysis and reporting purposes.
