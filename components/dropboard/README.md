# Overview

The Dropboard API enables management and optimization of shipping logistics, providing functionality to monitor shipments, manage inventory, and handle orders efficiently. With this API, Pipedream users can automate various aspects of logistics and supply chain operations, enhancing real-time decision-making and operational efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Order Processing and Shipment Tracking**: Connect Dropboard to Shopify using Pipedream to automate order processing. When a new order is placed in Shopify, trigger a workflow in Pipedream to create a shipment in Dropboard, then continually track the shipment status and update the customer via email or SMS.

- **Inventory Management and Alerts**: Link Dropboard to Slack via Pipedream to manage inventory levels. Set up a workflow where Dropboard sends daily inventory data to Pipedream, which processes this data and sends a notification to a Slack channel if stock levels for critical items are low.

- **Consolidated Reporting for Management**: Integrate Dropboard with Google Sheets using Pipedream to automate the generation of daily logistics reports. Extract data from Dropboard on shipments, inventory, and orders, process it in Pipedream, and automatically update a Google Sheet that is used for daily operational review and long-term analysis.
