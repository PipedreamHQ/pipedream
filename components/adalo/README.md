# Overview

The Adalo API allows for the creation and manipulation of database records in your Adalo apps. Automating workflows with Pipedream can enhance your Adalo app's functionality, trigger custom actions based on app events, sync data across platforms, or notify users and team members about important updates. By leveraging Pipedream's ability to connect with hundreds of other apps, you can create sophisticated, multi-step workflows that respond dynamically to your Adalo app's data and events.

# Example Use Cases

- **User Onboarding Automation**: Whenever a new user signs up in your Adalo app, Pipedream can automatically send a welcome email through SendGrid, add the user to a Mailchimp list for future newsletters, and create a new record in a Google Sheets spreadsheet for tracking purposes.

- **Inventory Management Sync**: If your Adalo app manages inventory, Pipedream can listen for changes in your product database. When a product's stock level falls below a certain threshold, it can trigger an order in a supplier's system via their API, update a Slack channel to notify your team, and adjust inventory levels in a connected Shopify store.

- **Scheduled Content Publishing**: For apps that rely on content delivery, Pipedream can use Adalo's API to schedule and publish content at specific times. It could check a Google Calendar for scheduled posts, retrieve the content from a Google Drive folder, and then update the appropriate records in your Adalo app to make the content live.
