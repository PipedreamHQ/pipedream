# Overview

The Marketstack API provides access to real-time, intraday, and historical stock prices from various global stock exchanges. In Pipedream, you can harness this data to create powerful workflows: trigger actions based on stock price movements, log data for analysis, or integrate with other financial services. It's a tool for financial analysts, investors, and anyone needing stock market data for their applications.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Stock Alerting System**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that monitors specific stocks using the Marketstack API. When a stock hits a certain threshold, trigger an alert via email, SMS, or push notification using integrated services like SendGrid, Twilio, or Pushover.

- **Daily Portfolio Summary**: Set up a Pipedream daily cron job that fetches the closing prices of your portfolio stocks from Marketstack. Then, compile a report and send it to your preferred communication app, whether that's Slack, Discord, or Email, to keep track of your investments' performance.

- **Market Movement Dashboard Sync**: Use Marketstack to fuel a live dashboard that tracks the markets. Connect to Google Sheets or a database service like PostgreSQL on Pipedream to record data points throughout the day. Use this data to visualize trends and inform your trading decisions.
