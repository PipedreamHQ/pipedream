# Overview

Benchmark Email API lets you automate your email marketing efforts. You can manage subscribers, send emails, and track campaign results. With Pipedream's serverless platform, tapping into this API means you can create custom, automated workflows that respond to events in real time across various apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Welcome Email Series**: Trigger a series of welcome emails in Benchmark Email when a new user signs up on your platform. Use Pipedream to listen to signup webhooks from your app, then add the new user to a specific Benchmark Email list and kick off a welcome email sequence.

- **Subscriber List Syncing**: Keep your CRM contacts and Benchmark Email subscriber lists in sync. Set up a Pipedream workflow to monitor changes in your CRM (like Salesforce or HubSpot), and automatically update subscriber lists in Benchmark Email whenever new contacts are added or existing contacts are updated.

- **Survey Response Campaigns**: After a user completes a survey through a platform like Typeform, use Pipedream to capture the submission, analyze responses, and trigger a follow-up email campaign in Benchmark Email tailored to the user's feedback.
