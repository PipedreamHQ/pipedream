# Overview

The Google Analytics API lets you access data from your Google Analytics
account to build custom reports and dashboards. With the API, you can query
data from your account, customize the data returned, and access data in real
time.

Here are some examples of what you can build with the Google Analytics API:

- A dashboard to track your website's traffic
- A report to show which keywords are driving traffic to your website
- A tool to track how users are interacting with your website
- A report to show which browsers and devices are being used to access your
  website
