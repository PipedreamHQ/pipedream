# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Employee Onboarding**: When a new employee is added to Connecteam, automatically send personalized welcome emails using Gmail, create tasks in Asana for their training schedule, and add them to relevant channels on Slack. This workflow ensures a seamless integration of the new employee into the companyâ€™s ecosystem.

- **Shift Scheduling Notifications**: Whenever a new shift is scheduled in Connecteam, set up a workflow to notify the assigned employee via SMS using Twilio and create an event in their Google Calendar. This helps in keeping the workforce informed and prepared for upcoming shifts, reducing no-shows and scheduling conflicts.

- **Real-time Incident Reporting**: Configure a workflow where if an incident is reported on Connecteam, it automatically creates a detailed report in Google Docs and sends alerts to specific Slack channels dedicated to safety or management. This immediate action can accelerate the response time to incidents, ensuring they are handled swiftly and documented properly.
