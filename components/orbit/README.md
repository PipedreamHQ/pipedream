# Overview

The Orbit API enables you to monitor and manage the uptime and performance of your websites and internet services. Through automation and integration on Pipedream, you can streamline incident management, aggregate performance data, and enhance communication across your tech stack. By leveraging real-time data from Orbit, you can trigger workflows based on site status changes, get aggregated insights, and automate responses to performance issues.

# Example Use Cases

- **Incident Response Automation**: When Orbit detects a website down event, trigger an automated workflow on Pipedream that sends an alert to Slack, creates an incident in PagerDuty, and sends an email to the support team. This ensures that the right people are notified instantly for a quick response.

- **Performance Monitoring Dashboard**: Collect and aggregate data from Orbit on site performance and uptime, then use Pipedream to send this data to a Google Sheets document. Create a live dashboard that provides an at-a-glance view of the health of all monitored services, making it easier for the team to spot issues and trends over time.

- **Scheduled Uptime Reports**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that periodically retrieves uptime statistics from Orbit and compiles a comprehensive report. Email this report to stakeholders on a weekly or monthly basis, or post it to a team channel in Microsoft Teams, to maintain transparency and keep everyone informed about site reliability.
