# Overview

Laposta is a robust email marketing tool, empowering users to build, send, and analyze email campaigns with ease. Leveraging the Laposta API on Pipedream, you can automate email list management, subscriber data synchronization, and campaign performance tracking. The API enables developers to create dynamic, serverless workflows that react to events across various apps, enrich contact information, or even trigger custom email sequences based on user behavior or other external cues.

# Example Use Cases

- **Email List Sync with E-Commerce Platforms**: Automatically add new customers from an e-commerce platform like Shopify to a specific Laposta mailing list. When a new order is placed or a customer account is created, trigger a Pipedream workflow that uses the Laposta API to update your subscriber list.

- **Survey Responses to Email Segmentation**: After a user completes a survey through platforms like Typeform, use their responses to segment them in Laposta. Pipedream can catch the survey submission webhook, process the data, and use the Laposta API to tag subscribers for targeted campaigns based on their interests or feedback.

- **Campaign Performance to Analytics Dashboards**: Post campaign performance data from Laposta to a Google Sheets or a BI tool like Tableau. Set up a Pipedream workflow to periodically retrieve campaign analytics from Laposta and log the data, helping you visualize trends and optimize future email marketing strategies.
