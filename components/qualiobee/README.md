# Overview

Qualiobee API facilitates interactions with Qualiobee's services, which focus on improving air quality through a network of connected devices. The API allows for the retrieval of air quality data, device management, and user interaction data, making it a potent tool for building environment monitoring systems, smart home integrations, or public health informational tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Air Quality Alert System**: Create a Pipedream workflow that triggers an alert via SMS or email using the Twilio or SendGrid app when the Qualiobee API reports air quality levels below a specific threshold. This can be vital for people with respiratory issues or for educational institutions to safeguard children's health.

- **Smart Home Integration**: Automate home devices such as air purifiers or HVAC systems connected via SmartThings or IFTTT. Set up a workflow on Pipedream where if Qualiobee detects poor air quality, it sends a command to these devices to activate or adjust settings, enhancing indoor air quality automatically.

- **Data Visualization for Public Health Monitoring**: Leverage the Qualiobee API to fetch air quality data at regular intervals and feed it into a Google Sheets or a dashboard on Grafana via Pipedream. Public health officials or environmental agencies can use this data to monitor air quality trends, make informed decisions, and educate the public on air quality issues.
