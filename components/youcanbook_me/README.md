# Overview

The YouCanBook.me API allows developers to easily integrate booking and
appointment-scheduling capabilities into any website or application. With the
API, developers can programmatically build bookable experiences that let
customers book available appointments and see a personalized, real-time view of
their calendars.

The API lets developers customize the booking experience in a wide variety of
ways. You can easily adjust the button design, create custom booking forms,
define how and when customers will receive a booking confirmation, add
additional fields, provide access to members-only appointments, and plenty
more.

With the YouCanBook.me API, you can build the following:

- Scheduling Widgets: Create widgets with simple embed codes that can be
  custom-styled to fit the look and feel of your website.
- Automated Appointment Reminders: Send automated reminder emails or text
  messages to customers when an appointment is approaching.
- Online Payment Portals: Link the WooCommerce or Shopify payment gateways to
  the YouCanBook.me API for secure online payments.
- Messaging Integrations: Create automated messaging experiences with other
  providers like WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, and more.
- Automated Notifications: Send automatic notifications to customers and staff
  when bookings are made or cancelled.
- Calendar Connections: Connect YouCanBook.Me with 3rd-party calendaring
  applications, like iCalendar and Google Calendar.
