# Overview

The Basin API provides a powerful platform for automating form submissions, gathering feedback, and conducting surveys with ease. By leveraging the Pipedream's serverless execution model, you can trigger workflows in response to new form submissions, process and analyze the data, and take action in countless other apps. Whether you're routing form data to a CRM, generating support tickets, or synthesizing customer insights, Basin on Pipedream simplifies these tasks with its event-driven architecture and seamless integrations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Feedback Analysis**: When a new form submission occurs in Basin, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends the data to a sentiment analysis service like MonkeyLearn. The analyzed sentiment can then be logged to a Google Sheet for aggregate reporting, providing real-time insights into customer satisfaction.

- **Support Ticket Creation**: Use Basin to capture support requests and auto-generate tickets in a tool like Zendesk or Jira using Pipedream workflows. Each form submission can create a new ticket, with the details from the form mapped to the corresponding fields in the ticketing system, streamlining the support process.

- **Email Campaign Enrollment**: For each new sign-up through a Basin form, trigger a Pipedream workflow to add the contact to an email marketing list in Mailchimp. The workflow can further segment the contacts based on the responses, enabling targeted email campaigns that resonate with specific audience segments.
