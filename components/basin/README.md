# Overview

Basin helps you build custom forms for your web projects remarkably fast, without the massive engineering lift. It works out of the box with all your favorite tools and frameworks with no dependencies, special libraries, or extra configuration needed. Simply point your forms to Basin and it will:

- Collect and store submission records
- Block spam
- Send email notifications
- Trigger downstream integrations with connected apps (like Pipedream)

Basin saves you the time and hassle of building, monitoring, and maintaining your own form backend or API.
