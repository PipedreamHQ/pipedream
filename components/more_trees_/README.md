# Overview

The More Trees API enables users to integrate tree planting into their apps and workflows. It offers a way to automate the process of planting trees, allowing users to contribute to reforestation efforts globally through their business practices or personal projects. With this API on Pipedream, you can create serverless workflows that respond to various triggers (like eCommerce transactions or milestones) and automatically initiate tree planting tasks. This not only greenifies your operations but also provides a tangible way to showcase corporate social responsibility.

# Example Use Cases

- **E-Commerce Green Initiative**: Automatically plant a tree for every product sold on your eCommerce platform. When a new order is placed, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends a request to More Trees API to plant a tree, then notify the customer of this contribution via email.

- **Sustainable User Onboarding**: For each new user signup on your app, you could use Pipedream to call the More Trees API to plant a tree in their honor. This workflow can be further enhanced by integrating with a messaging app like Slack or Microsoft Teams to announce each new signup and the corresponding eco-friendly action.

- **Social Media Milestone Celebration**: Create a workflow that monitors your company's social media for specific milestone achievements (like reaching a certain number of followers). Use Pipedream to trigger the More Trees API to plant a set number of trees for each milestone, and then auto-generate a social media post to share the good news.
