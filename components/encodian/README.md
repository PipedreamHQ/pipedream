# Overview

The Encodian API provides robust document management and manipulation capabilities, enabling users to convert, merge, split, OCR, and watermark documents. This API integrates smoothly with Pipedream, allowing for the automation of document processing tasks within various workflows. By leveraging Encodian with Pipedream, users can create efficient automations that handle large volumes of documents, reducing manual effort and improving productivity in document-centric processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing**: Integrate Encodian with an email app like Gmail on Pipedream to automatically extract invoices received via email, convert them from PDF to a more editable format like Word, apply OCR if needed, and store the processed files in a cloud storage service like Google Drive.

- **Contract Management Automation**: Use Encodian to merge multiple contract sections stored in Dropbox into a single document, apply a digital signature using a service like DocuSign, and then archive the signed contract in a SharePoint folder, all orchestrated within a Pipedream workflow.

- **Employee Onboarding Documents Handling**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream where Encodian converts all new employee onboarding documents uploaded to a specific Google Drive folder into PDF format, watermarks them with the company logo, and then emails the final copies to the HR department using Microsoft Outlook.
