# Overview

The Workiz API opens up a world of possibilities for managing field service operations. By tapping into Workiz with Pipedream, you can automate workflows, sync data across apps, and react to events in real-time. Whether you're automating job scheduling, dispatch notifications, or customer follow-ups, integrating Workiz with Pipedream allows you to streamline operations, reduce manual entry, and keep your team in sync.

# Example Use Cases

- **Job Status Webhook Trigger**: When a job status updates in Workiz, trigger a Pipedream workflow to send a custom email or SMS to the customer. Combine this with a service like SendGrid or Twilio on Pipedream for seamless communication.

- **Dynamic Scheduling Assistant**: Integrate Workiz with Google Calendar via Pipedream to automatically schedule jobs and update both systems in real-time. Whenever a new job is created in Workiz, a corresponding event can be added to a Google Calendar, making sure your team never misses an appointment.

- **Inventory Management**: Use Workiz's API to monitor inventory levels within Pipedream. If stock drops below a certain threshold, automatically generate a purchase order and send it to your supplier through an app like QuickBooks or send a notification to the responsible manager via Slack.
