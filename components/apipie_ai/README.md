# Overview

[APIpie.ai](https://apipie.ai) connects developers with open-source and commercial AI models via a unified API. With zero infrastructure setup, you can send requests to popular models, switch providers instantly, and explore a growing catalog of AI modelsâ€”all through one endpoint. Here's an overview of the services offered by [APIpie's API](https://apipie.ai):

- **Model Discovery**: List and explore available LLM models, image models, voice models, and voices from various providers as seen on the [APIpie Dashboard](https://apipie.ai/dashboard)
- **Chat Completions**: Send messages to any supported model and receive AI-generated responses
- **Image Generation**: Create images using AI image generation models
- **Text-to-Speech**: Convert text to speech using various voice models and voices

Use Python or Node.js code to make fully authenticated API requests with your APIpie account, enabling you to prototype, test, or integrate AI-generated content including text, images, and speech into apps, emails, alerts, dashboards, and more.

# Example Use Cases

The [APIpie API](https://apipie.ai) can be leveraged in a wide range of business contexts to drive efficiency, enhance customer experiences, and innovate product offerings through unified access to multiple AI models. Here are some specific business use cases for utilizing the APIpie API:

### **Customer Support Automation**

Significantly reduce response times and free up human agents to tackle more complex issues by automating customer support ticket responses. Use the List Models actions to dynamically select the most appropriate AI model based on ticket complexity or language requirements, then leverage Chat Completions to generate contextual, helpful responses that can be reviewed before sending to customers.

### **Content Creation and Management**

Utilize AI to generate high-quality content for blogs, articles, product descriptions, and marketing material. Create workflows that automatically test different models using the same prompt to compare writing styles, then select the best output for your brand voice. Generate accompanying images and convert text to speech for multimedia content creation. APIpie's unified interface lets you experiment with various open-source and commercial models without managing multiple API integrations.

### **Creative Asset Generation**

Generate visual content and audio assets for marketing campaigns, presentations, and social media. Use image generation models to create custom graphics, illustrations, and visual content that align with your brand. Convert written content to speech using different voice models to create podcasts, audiobooks, or accessibility features for your applications.

### **Multi-Model AI Experimentation Framework**

Build intelligent systems that automatically compare AI model performance across different use cases and modalities. Set up workflows that test text generation, image creation, and voice synthesis across multiple models simultaneously, collect responses in databases, and analyze quality, cost, and latency differences. This enables data-driven decisions about which AI models work best for specific business scenarios while maintaining the flexibility to switch providers as new models become available.

# Getting Started

First, sign up for an APIpie account, then in a new workflow step open the APIpie app and select one of the available actions:

- **List LLM Models**: Fetch the current catalog of available language models
- **List Image Models**: Fetch the current catalog of available image generation models
- **List Voice Models**: Fetch the current catalog of available voice models
- **List Voices**: Fetch the available voices for text-to-speech
- **Chat**: Send messages to any supported language model and receive responses
- **Create Image**: Generate images using AI image generation models
- **Create Text to Speech**: Convert text to speech using various voice models and voices

Then connect your APIpie account to Pipedream. Visit [APIpie.ai](https://apipie.ai) and navigate to your profile to generate your [API key.](https://apipie.ai/profile/api-keys)

Copy your API key and paste it into Pipedream when prompted. Now you're all set to use pre-built actions like `Chat`, `Create Image`, `Create Text to Speech`, or any of the list actions, or use your APIpie API key directly in Node.js or Python code to access the unified AI model interface.
