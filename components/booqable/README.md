# Overview

The Booqable API provides programmatic access to rental shop functions such as inventory management, orders, and customers. Within Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate tasks, sync data across platforms, and create custom workflows. The API's endpoints allow you to programmatically check item availability, manage bookings, and update customer information, making it suitable for integrating with a wide range of other apps and services to streamline operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Inventory Sync with Shopify**: When new products are added or updated in Booqable, trigger a workflow in Pipedream to reflect those changes in your Shopify store. Keep inventory levels in sync across both platforms, ensuring accurate stock data and avoiding overbooking.

- **Scheduled Order Reporting**: Use Pipedream's scheduled triggers to fetch daily rental orders from Booqable and compile a report. Send this report via email with SendGrid or save it to Google Sheets for easy sharing and analysis, helping you keep track of rental performance.

- **New Customer Onboarding**: When a new customer is created in Booqable, kick off a Pipedream workflow to add them to a Mailchimp list for email marketing, create a contact in HubSpot for CRM tracking, and send a personalized welcome message via Twilio SMS, enhancing the customer experience right from the start.
