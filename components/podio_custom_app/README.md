# Overview

Podio's Custom App API unleashes the power to mold the Podio platform to fit your project and workflow needs. It grants the ability to create, modify, and orchestrate data across various Podio apps. By leveraging Pipedream's serverless platform, you can connect Podio with hundreds of other services for automation. This means you can trigger actions in Podio or react to events in Podio with custom logic, transform data, and pass it between your apps in real-time, without the need to manage infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Contacts Between Podio and a CRM**: Automatically sync contact details created or updated in a Podio Custom App with a CRM system like Salesforce. Each new contact in Podio could be added to Salesforce, and updates in Podio could trigger updates in Salesforce, keeping all contact information consistent across platforms.

- **Project Management Automation**: When a new project is added to a Podio Custom App, trigger the creation of a corresponding Trello board or Asana project. Integrate time-tracking tools like Toggl to automatically log time as tasks progress, or connect with Slack to notify team members of new tasks and updates within Podio.

- **Lead Qualification and Distribution**: On receiving a new lead in a Podio Custom App, use Pipedream to qualify the lead based on custom logic (e.g., source, industry, size). Then, distribute qualified leads to specific sales team members in tools like HubSpot or via direct email. Additionally, log all interactions in a Podio app for centralized lead management.
