# Overview

The FogBugz API allows you to interact with your FogBugz software development tracking system programmatically. With this API, you can create, read, update, and delete cases; manage projects, areas, and categories; and perform searches to gather data-driven insights. Integrating FogBugz with Pipedream opens up possibilities for automating workflows, syncing data across platforms, and reacting to events within FogBugz in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Bug Reporting**: When a new bug is reported in your product through another platform, like Sentry or GitHub, you can automatically create a corresponding case in FogBugz using Pipedream. This ensures that bugs are tracked and managed efficiently without manual intervention.

- **Project Management Enhancement**: Sync FogBugz cases to a Trello board or a Google Sheet to provide additional project management views. Each time a case is updated in FogBugz, Pipedream can move a Trello card to a different list or update a row in Google Sheets, keeping all project stakeholders in sync with development progress.

- **Customer Support Integration**: Connect your customer support platform, such as Zendesk, to FogBugz via Pipedream. When a support ticket in Zendesk is flagged as a bug, automatically create a case in FogBugz and link the two, streamlining the process of tracking and resolving customer-reported issues.
