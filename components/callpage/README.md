# Overview

The CallPage API enables automations centered around phone calls and lead management. Integrating this API with Pipedream allows you to create, update, and track calls, as well as manage users and leads. With Pipedream's serverless architecture, you can easily connect CallPage to other apps, triggering complex workflows from CallPage events or performing actions in CallPage in response to external triggers.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Qualification Automation**: Automate the process of qualifying leads by connecting CallPage to a CRM like HubSpot. When a call ends, send the call details and outcome to HubSpot to create or update a contact, enriching lead data for better follow-up and conversion.

- **Real-time SMS Notifications**: Get immediate notifications via Twilio SMS when a new call is requested through CallPage. Use this workflow to alert sales reps so they can connect with potential clients faster, reducing response times and increasing the likelihood of closing deals.

- **Customer Support Ticket Creation**: Create a helpdesk ticket in a platform like Zendesk when a call on CallPage indicates a customer support issue. By capturing call details and client requests, you can ensure that support teams are informed and can provide timely assistance.
