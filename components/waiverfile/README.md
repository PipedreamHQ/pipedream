# Overview

With the WaiverFile API, you can automate interactions with your WaiverFile account directly from Pipedream. This API provides access to manage and retrieve waivers, customer data, and events, allowing you to integrate WaiverFile with other services for streamlined workflows. You could automate the sending of waiver links, synchronize signed waivers with a database, or trigger actions based on waiver completions. The flexibility of the WaiverFile API means you can create powerful automations tailored to your business needs on Pipedream's serverless platform.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automatic Waiver Follow-up Emails**: When a customer signs a waiver, trigger an automated email through an email service like SendGrid or Mailgun, thanking them or providing additional information. This improves customer experience without manual intervention.

- **Sync Waivers to Google Sheets for Record-Keeping**: Automatically send completed waivers to a Google Sheet. This keeps records up-to-date and makes it easy to monitor and analyze waiver submissions in real-time, without manual data entry.

- **Slack Notifications for New Waivers**: Set up a workflow that sends a notification to a specific Slack channel whenever a waiver is signed. This is useful for real-time updates, allowing team members to promptly take any necessary follow-up actions.
