# Overview

Trello's API lets you craft workflows around managing boards, lists, cards, and users. With Pipedream, you can automate Trello tasks, like syncing cards with external databases, updating checklists, and posting notifications to other platforms. It enables seamless connection with other apps, fostering productivity by automating routine board operations, card management, and team notifications.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Project Management**: Sync Trello cards with a GitHub repository, creating issues from new cards, and updating cards when issues are closed. This keeps developers and stakeholders aligned across platforms.

- **Marketing Campaign Tracker**: Connect Trello with Google Sheets to track campaign progress. When a card moves to the "Complete" list, automatically log the details in a spreadsheet, giving a real-time view of campaign status.

- **Team Coordination**: Integrate Trello with Slack, notifying a channel when due dates are updated or cards are marked complete, ensuring the team stays informed of task progression without having to check Trello.
