# Overview

The Tremendous API lets you automate the distribution of digital rewards and incentives, such as gift cards, prepaid VisaÂ® cards, cash, and more. It's perfect for businesses wanting to scale their reward programs without manual intervention. With Pipedream, you can harness the Tremendous API to create dynamic, serverless workflows that trigger rewards based on various events, integrate with CRM systems for customer milestones, or streamline employee recognition processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Loyalty Rewards**: Automatically send a digital gift card to customers who have completed a certain number of purchases. Use Pipedream to monitor your e-commerce platform, such as Shopify, for purchase events, and trigger the Tremendous API to dispatch the reward.

- **Survey Participation Incentives**: Incentivize survey responses by offering a reward upon completion. Connect Typeform or Google Forms to Tremendous through Pipedream. When a survey is completed, a workflow triggers the Tremendous API to send an appropriate incentive.

- **Employee Recognition Program**: Streamline employee rewards by integrating Tremendous with HR platforms like BambooHR. Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for work anniversaries or performance achievements, then automatically sends a personalized reward via the Tremendous API.
