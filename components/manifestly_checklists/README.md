# Overview

Manifestly Checklists API allows for the creation, management, and tracking of detailed checklists within your workflows. Leveraging this API in Pipedream, you can automate checklist operations, which is indispensable for ensuring consistency in processes like onboarding, maintenance schedules, or content publication. By integrating Manifestly with other apps on Pipedream, you can build seamless automation that triggers actions based on checklist status, responses, or completion.

# Example Use Cases

- **Employee Onboarding Automation**: Automatically create and assign onboarding checklists to new hires when they are added to your HR management platform, such as BambooHR. Once the checklist is completed, trigger a workflow that updates their status in the HR system and sends a welcome email.

- **Content Publication Workflow**: Connect Manifestly to your CMS, like WordPress. Whenever a new blog post is ready for review, automatically generate a publishing checklist. Once the checklist is completed, the workflow can publish the post on your website and share it on social media platforms.

- **Maintenance Schedule Coordinator**: Integrate Manifestly with IoT monitoring tools like Ubidots. When a piece of equipment reports a fault or scheduled maintenance is due, automatically create a maintenance checklist and notify the technical team. On checklist completion, log the event in a maintenance tracking system and inform stakeholders.
