# Overview

Magnetic is a project management and workflow automation platform designed to help agencies stay organized and streamline operations. With the Magnetic API on Pipedream, you can automate routine tasks, sync data across various apps, and create custom workflows to enhance productivity. From task creation and time tracking to financial management and reporting, Pipedreamâ€™s serverless execution model lets you connect Magnetic with a plethora of other services without the need for a dedicated server setup.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Task Assignment**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that triggers when a new sales deal is closed in your CRM (like Salesforce). The workflow would automatically create a corresponding project and tasks in Magnetic, assigning them to the appropriate team members based on predefined criteria.

- **Time Tracking Integration**: Set up a workflow that connects Magnetic to time tracking apps like Toggl or Harvest. Whenever a task is marked as completed in Magnetic, the workflow could log the time spent on the task in the time tracking app, ensuring accurate and effortless time management.

- **Financial Dashboard Sync**: Configure a Pipedream workflow to sync Magnetic's project financial data with accounting software such as QuickBooks. Any updates to budgets, expenses, or invoices in Magnetic would be reflected in QuickBooks in real time, giving you an up-to-date view of financials for better decision-making.
