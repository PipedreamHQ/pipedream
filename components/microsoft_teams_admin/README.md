# Overview

The Microsoft Teams Admin API allows you to manage Teams environments programmatically. With it, you can automate tasks like creating and managing teams, channels, and policies, as well as controlling membership and settings. Leveraging Pipedream's serverless execution model, you can create workflows that react to specific triggers and perform a sequence of actions across multiple services, enhancing your organization's productivity and governance within Microsoft Teams.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Team Provisioning**: When a new employee is onboarded and added to your HR system, a Pipedream workflow can be triggered to create a new team in Microsoft Teams, complete with predefined channels and settings, ensuring they have the resources they need from day one.

- **Policy Compliance Monitoring**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to regularly audit team settings and memberships against compliance policies. If it detects a policy violation, such as a public team containing sensitive information, the workflow can automatically revert changes and notify administrators.

- **Cross-Platform Collaboration**: Integrate Microsoft Teams Admin with Slack using Pipedream. Whenever a new Slack channel is created in your company's workspace, a corresponding team or channel can be created in Teams, ensuring cross-platform collaboration is streamlined and no team is siloed.
