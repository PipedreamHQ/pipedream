# Overview

Alerty API allows users to create and manage real-time alerts based on various data inputs. With Alerty, you can trigger notifications based on specific conditions, thresholds, or anomalies within your data streams. This functionality is especially useful in monitoring applications, systems, and operational metrics, helping to quickly respond to issues or opportunities. When integrated with Pipedream, Alerty can leverage a multitude of external services for automated data input and action triggering, streamlining operational responses and enhancing real-time decision-making.

# Example Use Cases

- **System Health Monitoring**: Automate system or application health checks by integrating Alerty with cron jobs on Pipedream. Set conditions in Alerty to monitor CPU usage, memory consumption, or error rates, and trigger alerts for anomalies or exceeding thresholds. This can help in proactive maintenance and downtime reduction.

- **Sales Performance Alerts**: Connect Alerty with a sales platform like Salesforce via Pipedream. Configure Alerty to monitor sales data and trigger alerts when unusual sales patterns are detected or when hitting certain sales milestones. Useful for real-time sales team notifications to dynamically adjust strategies.

- **Customer Support Ticket Escalation**: Use Alerty with a customer support tool like Zendesk on Pipedream. Set up alerts for high-priority support tickets or tickets that have not been resolved within a specific time frame. This ensures critical issues are escalated and addressed promptly, improving customer satisfaction and support efficiency.
