# Overview

Mailrefine API provides robust email validation and verification services, helping to clean up email lists by removing invalid or risky email addresses. This ensures that your email marketing campaigns reach real users and reduces bounce rates, significantly improving the efficiency of email marketing efforts. Integrated within Pipedream's environment, Mailrefine can automate email verification processes in real-time during user sign-ups, periodic email list cleaning, or before launching marketing campaigns to maintain email deliverability and reputation.

# Example Use Cases

- **User Validation at Signup**: Automate the process of validating email addresses as soon as users sign up on your platform. Connect Mailrefine to your user registration form on platforms like WordPress or Shopify. This workflow can automatically verify emails entered in the form, ensuring that all user accounts are created with a valid email, thus reducing the risk of spam or fraudulent accounts.

- **Scheduled Email List Cleaning**: Set up a scheduled workflow in Pipedream that triggers at regular intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to clean your email list. Use Mailrefine to validate and segment active, inactive, and invalid email addresses. This can be particularly beneficial for maintaining high deliverability and engagement rates in tools like Mailchimp or SendGrid.

- **Real-Time Email Verification for Lead Capture Forms**: Integrate Mailrefine with lead capture forms used in marketing campaigns or on landing pages. When a lead enters their email, use Pipedream to instantly verify the email through Mailrefine before adding the lead to your CRM tool like Salesforce or HubSpot. This ensures that your sales team only works with leads that have a valid email, increasing the efficiency of follow-up processes.
