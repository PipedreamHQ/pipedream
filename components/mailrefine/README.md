# Overview

The Mailrefine API provides a robust solution for email validation and list cleaning, allowing you to improve the deliverability and effectiveness of your email marketing campaigns. By using Pipedream, you can automate processes that involve validating bulk email lists, segregating invalid or risky email addresses, and enriching your email data with additional information. This API, when hooked into Pipedream's serverless platform, can quickly become part of a powerful automation chain that enhances data flow between your email marketing tools and other business apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Email Validation on New Sign-ups**: Automate the process of validating emails as soon as users sign up through your platform. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers when a new user registers, sends their email through the Mailrefine API to check its validity, and then updates the user's status or sends a notification based on the validation results.

- **Scheduled List Cleaning**: Create a workflow that periodically cleans your email lists. Use a scheduled trigger to initiate the workflow, process the list through Mailrefine to remove invalid emails, and update your email marketing platform, such as Mailchimp, with the cleaned list to maintain a high deliverability rate.

- **Response Handling for Email Campaigns**: Construct a workflow that manages responses from an email campaign. After sending out emails through a service like SendGrid, use the responses to trigger a Pipedream workflow. Check each responderâ€™s email for validity using Mailrefine, and log valid respondents into a CRM like Salesforce, while tagging invalid ones for further review.
