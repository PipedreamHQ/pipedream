# Example Use Cases

For instance, create a workflow that adds a new contact to Salesforce whenever a new contact is created in JustCall, ensuring that your sales team always has the latest information at their fingertips.

- **Log JustCall Call Records**: Integrate JustCall with Google Sheets to log call details. Each time a call is made or received in JustCall, log the call information, including timestamp, caller ID, and call duration, into a Google Sheet. This can be invaluable for sales teams to track customer interactions and for customer support to maintain detailed records.
