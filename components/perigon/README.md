# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Data Synchronization**: Automatically sync customer data from a CRM like Salesforce to Perigon. Whenever a new contact is added or updated in Salesforce, trigger a Pipedream workflow that updates the corresponding record in Perigon, ensuring data consistency across platforms.

- **Inventory Management**: Integrate Perigon with an e-commerce platform like Shopify. Set up a Pipedream workflow to monitor stock levels in Perigon and, when stock falls below a certain threshold, send a replenishment request to your supplier and update inventory quantities on Shopify, keeping your sales and supply chain in sync.

- **Data Analysis and Reporting**: Connect Perigon to a business intelligence tool like Tableau. Use Pipedream to schedule and trigger data export from Perigon, transform and prepare the data as needed, and upload it to Tableau for advanced analysis and visualization. This allows for regular, automated reporting that aids in strategic decision-making.
