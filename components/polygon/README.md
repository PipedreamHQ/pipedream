# Overview

The Polygon API grants access to a wealth of financial data, including real-time and historical stock prices, trade data, and more. Within Pipedream's serverless integration platform, you can tap into Polygon to create powerful workflows. With Pipedream, you can easily connect Polygon to 3,000+ other apps, automate financial data processing, send stock alerts, or synchronize market data with databases or spreadsheets, all in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time Stock Dashboard Updates**: Trigger a workflow whenever new tick data is available on Polygon for specific stocks. Pipedream can process this data and update a Google Sheets dashboard, giving you a live view of stock performance.

- **Automated Trading Alerts**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for significant price changes or trade volumes reported by the Polygon API. When certain conditions are met, Pipedream sends alerts via Slack or email, keeping traders informed for quick decision-making.

- **Market Analysis and Reporting**: Leverage Pipedream's scheduled workflows to fetch daily market summaries from Polygon and compile a report. This report could be enriched with additional data from other financial services, formatted and then delivered to Dropbox or sent via email to a list of subscribers.
