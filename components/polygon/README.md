# Overview

The Polygon API provides extensive access to U.S. stock market data, including real-time and historical price information, company financials, and more. Within Pipedream, you can leverage this data to create powerful workflows, such as automating stock alerts, analyzing market trends, or integrating financial data into other business applications. The API's rich datasets are ideal for finance professionals, traders, and developers needing programmatic access to market intelligence.

## Example Use Cases

- **Real-time Stock Alerting**: Configure a workflow that listens for real-time price updates on selected stocks via the Polygon API. When a stock hits a predefined threshold, send an alert through email or messaging apps like Slack or Discord.

- **Daily Market Summary Reports**: Build a daily workflow that gathers market summary data from the Polygon API at market close. Process and compile the information into a digestible report, then distribute it via email to a list of subscribers or push it to a Google Sheet for further analysis.

- **Automated Portfolio Rebalancing**: Create a workflow that monitors your investment portfolio through the Polygon API. Set conditions for when portfolio rebalancing is required based on asset allocations. When triggered, the workflow can notify you or directly interface with a trading platform to execute the necessary trades.
