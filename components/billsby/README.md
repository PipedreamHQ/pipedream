# Overview

The Billsby API allows for automated subscription management, providing endpoints to create and manage customer accounts, subscriptions, invoices, and payments. With Pipedream, you can connect Billsby to hundreds of other services, triggering workflows based on subscription events, syncing customer data, or automating billing processes. This can lead to more efficient operations, better customer experiences, and timely data-driven decisions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Customer Onboarding**: When a new customer signs up via Billsby, trigger a Pipedream workflow to add the customer to a CRM like Salesforce, send a personalized welcome email through SendGrid, and create a Slack notification for the sales team.

- **Sync Subscription Status with a Database**: Keep a real-time sync between Billsby subscription statuses and a database like Google Sheets or Airtable. When a subscription changes in Billsby (like an upgrade or cancellation), the corresponding record in your database updates automatically.

- **Handle Failed Payments**: Set up a workflow that triggers when a payment fails in Billsby. The workflow could email the customer with updated payment instructions via a service like Mailgun, alert your support team in a tool like Zendesk, and even pause the customer's subscription until the payment issue is resolved.
