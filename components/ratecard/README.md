# Overview

The Ratecard API allows you to automate the feedback collection and reputation management process. With its endpoints, you can send out surveys, collect responses, and analyze customer satisfaction metrics. Integrating Ratecard with Pipedream opens up possibilities to trigger workflows based on events, sync customer data with your CRM, or even escalate issues based on feedback scores, all in real time and without managing servers.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Feedback Request Post-Transaction**: After a purchase is marked as complete in an e-commerce platform like Shopify, you can trigger a Pipedream workflow to automatically send out a Ratecard survey to the customer, asking for feedback on their shopping experience.

- **Customer Satisfaction Monitoring**: Connect Ratecard to a data visualization tool like Google Sheets using Pipedream. Whenever a new survey response comes in, append the data to a Google Sheet for real-time monitoring and analysis of customer satisfaction trends.

- **Support Ticket Escalation**: Integrate Ratecard with a customer support tool like Zendesk. If a survey response indicates a dissatisfied customer, trigger a workflow that creates a high-priority support ticket in Zendesk to ensure immediate follow-up.
