# Overview

The Pitchlane API enables users to automate and integrate media planning and buying processes. This API can streamline the creation, management, and optimization of advertising campaigns across various channels. By utilizing Pitchlane within Pipedream, users can connect their media planning tools with other business systems (like CRM, analytics, or communication platforms), automate repetitive tasks, and orchestrate complex workflows that respond to real-time data changes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Campaign Performance Sync to Google Sheets**: Automate the process of syncing detailed campaign performance data from Pitchlane to a Google Sheets document. This workflow can be set to trigger every time a campaign's data is updated, ensuring that stakeholders have access to the most current information without manual intervention. Useful for real-time reporting and data aggregation for meetings or audits.

- **Slack Notifications for Campaign Alerts**: Set up an automated alert system where any critical updates or metrics (like budget overruns or KPI achievements) are instantly sent as notifications to a designated Slack channel. This ensures that the marketing team stays informed about important developments in real-time, promoting swift decision-making and immediate responses to potential issues.

- **Automated Email Reports with SendGrid**: Design a workflow where weekly or monthly email summaries of campaign performances are automatically generated and sent through SendGrid. This can include key performance indicators, budget usage, and other relevant data tailored to the needs of different stakeholders. This eliminates the need for manual report preparation and ensures consistent updates are delivered to executives or clients.
