# Overview

The GoTo Meeting API allows developers to integrate their applications with GoTo Meetingâ€™s conferencing capabilities, enabling automation of meeting management tasks such as scheduling, updating, and fetching meeting details. With Pipedream, these capabilities can be expanded to create dynamic workflows that automate various aspects of meeting management in response to events from other apps, making meeting coordination seamless and efficient.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Meeting Scheduler with Google Calendar**: Automate the scheduling of GoTo meetings directly from Google Calendar events. When a new event is added to a specific Google Calendar, a Pipedream workflow can trigger the creation of a corresponding GoTo Meeting, and automatically send the meeting details back to the event description in Google Calendar.

- **Meeting Reminder System via SMS with Twilio**: Enhance attendee preparation by sending automated SMS reminders through Twilio. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers a reminder SMS to all attendees an hour before the GoTo Meeting starts, ensuring everyone is prepared and on time.

- **Post-Meeting Feedback Collection via Google Forms**: Automatically solicit feedback after each GoTo Meeting. Once a meeting ends, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends out a Google Forms survey to all participants to gather feedback on the meeting effectiveness, helping continuously improve meeting quality.
