# Overview

Refiner is a tool designed for user feedback and survey management. It helps businesses collect and analyze customer feedback efficiently. Using Refiner's API on Pipedream, you can automate the collection and synchronization of survey data, trigger targeted surveys based on user actions, and integrate responses with other data platforms to enhance user profiles or drive personalized marketing strategies.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Feedback Collection After Product Updates**: Trigger surveys from Refiner when a new version of a product is released. Use Pipedream to listen for a webhook from your product release management system, then automatically send a survey email to users who have updated the product. Gather and analyze feedback to quickly identify issues or successful features.

- **User Segmentation for Targeted Marketing**: Integrate Refiner with a CRM system like Salesforce. After a survey completion, use Pipedream to process the responses, segment users based on their feedback, and update their profiles in Salesforce. This information can then be used to tailor marketing campaigns and improve customer satisfaction.

- **Event-Driven NPS Tracking**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream that triggers a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey in Refiner whenever a significant interaction occurs, such as reaching a milestone in a service or completing a major transaction. Collect and log these NPS scores over time to monitor changes in customer satisfaction and loyalty.
