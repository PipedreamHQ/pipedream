# Overview

Kizeo Forms API lets you interact with the Kizeo platform to automate form data retrieval, manage users, and push or pull data to or from forms. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to create serverless workflows that trigger actions based on form submissions, integrate with other apps, or manage form data effectively. Use the API to connect Kizeo Forms with CRMs, project management tools, databases, and more, streamlining data collection and processing activities.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automatically Store Form Submissions in Google Sheets**: When a new form submission is received in Kizeo, the workflow triggers and extracts the submitted data, formatting it as needed, then appends it to a specified Google Sheet. This is ideal for keeping track of responses without manual data entry.

- **Send Email Notifications on Form Submission**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for new Kizeo form submissions and automatically sends a detailed email to a designated recipient â€“ useful for alerting staff when new data is available or when a customer has completed a critical form.

- **Create Trello Cards from Kizeo Form Entries**: Each time a form is submitted through Kizeo, the Pipedream workflow creates a new Trello card with the form data. This can be used to track tasks, feedback, or issues reported via forms, moving them into a project management flow seamlessly.
