# Overview

AbuseIPDB is a platform providing an API to report and check IP addresses to detect and prevent malicious activities. With the AbuseIPDB API on Pipedream, you can automate the process of monitoring, reporting, and acting upon incidents involving suspect IP addresses. This can mean auto-generating reports for suspicious traffic, cross-referencing with other security data sources, or triggering alerts in real-time for proactive defense measures.

# Example Use Cases

- **Detect and Report Malicious Activity**: Create a workflow where server logs are monitored for failed login attempts. When the number of attempts from an IP exceeds a threshold, the IP is checked against AbuseIPDB and if it's known for malicious activity, automatically report it back to AbuseIPDB for community awareness.

- **Automate Threat Intelligence Gathering**: Combine AbuseIPDB with other threat intelligence platforms like AlienVault OTX. Whenever a new threat is identified in OTX, check if any related IPs are already listed in AbuseIPDB, adding a new layer of insight to your security analysis and helping prioritize response based on known bad actors.

- **Real-time Security Alerts**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for webhook alerts from your firewall or intrusion detection system. When an alert contains an IP address, query AbuseIPDB to determine if the IP has a history of abuse. If so, automatically send a notification through Slack, email, or other communication platforms to alert the security team immediately.
