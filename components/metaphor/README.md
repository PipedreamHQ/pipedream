# Overview

The Exa (Formerly Metaphor) API enables you to enrich your applications with machine learning-powered insights and data processing capabilities. With Exa, you can perform advanced data analysis, extract meaningful patterns, and automate decision-making processes within your projects. By integrating this API with Pipedream, you can create seamless workflows that leverage these intelligent features alongside other services to streamline your operations, enhance data intelligence, and drive innovation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Analysis and Categorization**: Connect the Exa API to a content management system (CMS) on Pipedream. As new content is published—whether it be articles, posts, or reviews—the workflow triggers, sending the content to Exa for analysis. The API categorizes the content and extracts key topics, which you can then use to automatically tag and sort the content within the CMS or recommend related articles.

- **Customer Feedback Sentiment Analysis**: Integrate the Exa API with a customer support platform like Zendesk. Whenever a new customer ticket is submitted, the workflow kicks off, passing the ticket's text to Exa for sentiment analysis. Based on the sentiment score, the workflow can prioritize tickets, escalate urgent matters, or provide insights to the support team on the customer's emotional tone, helping them tailor their response.

- **Real-Time Market Trend Monitoring**: Combine the Exa API with a platform like Google Sheets on Pipedream. Set up a workflow that periodically collects social media posts or news articles relevant to your business from various sources. Exa analyzes this data for trends, sentiment, and key phrases, and then the workflow populates a Google Sheet with these insights, providing a real-time dashboard of market trends that can inform strategic decisions.
