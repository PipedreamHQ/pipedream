# Overview

Zulip is a powerful chat platform designed for productive and threaded group conversations. With the Zulip API, you can automate and extend the capabilities of your Zulip instance directly within Pipedream. This includes managing streams, users, messages, and events. Automations can help streamline communication, respond to specific triggers, and integrate chat data with other business tools to centralize workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Support Ticket Creation**: When a message tagged with #support is sent on Zulip, trigger a workflow that creates a ticket in a tool like Zendesk or Jira. This ensures that customer queries are promptly turned into trackable support tickets.

- **Real-time CRM Updates**: Use Pipedream to detect when a user mentions a sales deal in Zulip. Extract the details and update the corresponding opportunity in a CRM like Salesforce, ensuring the sales team has the latest information.

- **Daily Standup Summaries**: Schedule a Pipedream workflow to collect the previous day's standup messages from a designated Zulip stream. Compile and send a summary email to the team using a service like SendGrid, keeping everyone in sync even if they missed the live standup.
