# Overview

The Zulip API allows developers to create powerful applications that integrate
with their Zulip workspaces. This can be used to build advanced automation,
custom integrations, and other features not built into the Zulip platform.

With the Zulip API you can create automated bots, build custom notification
systems, manage users and groups, and even build advanced analytics. The API
provides access to the same data stored in the Zulip web and mobile
applications, allowing applications to use the same data and features.

Here are some examples of things you can build with the Zulip API:

- Automated bots: Create automated bots which respond to messages according to
  logic you define.
- Custom notifications: Send notifications to specific users in a stream or
  send bulk notifications to an entire organization or group.
- Manage users and groups: Automatically create and manage users and groups.
- Advanced analytics: Analyze patterns and trends in conversations and build
  visualizations to present the data.
- Custom integrations: Integrate other applications and services like social
  media, project management tools, and more.
- Create custom apps: Create your own web applications that interact with
  Zulip.
