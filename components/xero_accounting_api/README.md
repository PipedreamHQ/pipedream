# Overview

The Xero Accounting API offers a powerful gateway to access and manipulate financial data within Xero. Leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, developers can build custom workflows that streamline accounting processes, sync financial data with external systems, and trigger actions based on financial events. This API allows for the automation of tasks such as invoicing, bank reconciliation, bill payments, and reporting, which can lead to significant time savings and enhanced data accuracy.


# Getting Started
## Using Webhooks

Xero supports webhooks for instant notifications of specific event changes.

To create and use a webhook with Pipedream:

1. Create a **Webhook Event Received (Instant)** trigger in a workflow. You may leave the `Webhook Key` prop empty in this step.
2. Copy the generated URL endpoint from the trigger.
3. Go to your app in [Xero Developer](https://developer.xero.com/app/manage) and go to Webhooks.
4. Select the event types you want to be notified and paste the trigger URL in the **Delivery URL** field.
5. Copy the **Webhooks key** and click on **Save**.
6. Go to the Pipedream trigger and update the **Webhook Key** prop with the copied value.
7. Go back to Xero and click on **Send 'Intent to receive'** to start the verification process.
8. Wait for a few seconds until it shows **Status OK**.
9. You should then be able to receive notifications for changes in this trigger.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing**: Trigger a workflow when new invoices are created in Xero to send email notifications using SendGrid, thus keeping stakeholders informed in real-time about billing activities.

- **Expense Tracking and Approval Workflow**: Integrate Xero with Slack using Pipedream to automatically post messages to a designated channel for new expense claims, allowing for quick review and approval by the finance team.

- **Synchronized Customer Management**: When a new contact is added to Xero, use Pipedream to trigger a workflow that creates or updates that contact in a CRM like Salesforce, ensuring consistent client information across business platforms.
