# Overview

Celoxis is a comprehensive project management tool that offers an API to automate and integrate your project management activities. Using its API with Pipedream, you can streamline processes, sync data across multiple platforms, and trigger actions based on project updates or milestones. For instance, you can automate task assignments, track time, update project statuses, and generate custom reports, all by connecting Celoxis with other tools and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Project Status Updates to Slack**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever a project status changes in Celoxis. The workflow would fetch the updated project details and send a notification to a designated Slack channel, keeping your team informed in real-time.

- **Task Assignment Emails via SendGrid**: Automate the dispatch of task assignment emails when new tasks are created in Celoxis. Use Pipedream to integrate with SendGrid, sending personalized email notifications to team members, so they're immediately aware of their new responsibilities.

- **Sync Projects with Google Sheets**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to synchronize Celoxis project data with a Google Sheet. Whenever a project is updated in Celoxis, the relevant Google Sheet is automatically updated. This is ideal for maintaining an easily accessible, always up-to-date project overview for stakeholders not using Celoxis.
