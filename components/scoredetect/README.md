# Overview

The ScoreDetect API provides real-time sports scores and stats, offering a treasure trove of data for sports enthusiasts, bettors, and developers building applications tied to sports events. With Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create serverless workflows that react to live sports data, integrating with countless other apps to automate notifications, update databases, sync with social media, or even trigger custom actions based on game events.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time Score Updates to Slack**: Use ScoreDetect to monitor scores for your favorite team and set up a Pipedream workflow that sends a message to a Slack channel whenever there's a change in the score. This keeps your community or team informed without the need to constantly check external apps or websites.

- **Sports Betting Odds Analysis**: With ScoreDetect, you can pull in betting odds and results, then connect to a Google Sheets spreadsheet using Pipedream to log and analyze this data over time. This could help refine betting strategies or provide insights for content creation on sports betting forums or blogs.

- **Game Start Alerts via SMS**: Create a Pipedream workflow that uses ScoreDetect to track when games are starting. Combine this with the Twilio SMS service to send out alerts to subscribers, ensuring they never miss a game. This can be particularly useful for sports event organizers or bars that show live games and want to attract patrons.
