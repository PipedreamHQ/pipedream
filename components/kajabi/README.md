# Overview

Kajabi is a platform that allows creators to build and manage online courses, membership sites, and other digital products. The Kajabi API enables developers to programmatically interact with their Kajabi account, allowing for the automation of tasks such as managing users, products, offers, and more. By leveraging the Kajabi API on Pipedream, you can create powerful workflows that connect Kajabi to other apps and services, automate repetitive tasks, and streamline your digital content business.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate New Member Onboarding**: Trigger an email sequence in Mailchimp whenever a new member signs up for your course or membership site on Kajabi. This workflow can include personalized welcome emails, instructions on how to get started, and follow-up messages to keep engagement high.

- **Sync Kajabi with a CRM**: Keep your CRM, like Salesforce, updated in real-time by creating a workflow that adds or updates contacts whenever someone purchases a product or signs up for an offer on Kajabi. This ensures your sales team has the latest information for outreach and customer support.

- **Aggregate Course Metrics**: Pull data from Kajabi on course completions and quiz scores, then send this data to a Google Sheet for analysis. This automation can help you track student progress, identify popular courses, and find opportunities for improvement within your content.
