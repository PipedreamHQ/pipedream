# Overview

Leadfeeder is a tool that reveals the companies visiting your website and how they interact with your content. By harnessing the power of the Leadfeeder API on Pipedream, you can automate the process of capturing lead data and integrating it directly into your sales and marketing workflows. This can range from enriching CRM records to triggering custom email campaigns based on visitor behavior, enabling a more dynamic and responsive engagement with potential customers.

# Example Use Cases

- **Enrich CRM with Lead Data**: Automatically add new leads identified by Leadfeeder into your CRM, such as Salesforce or HubSpot. When a company visits your website, capture the event and create a new contact or update an existing record with the company’s details, visited pages, and engagement level.

- **Trigger Automated Outreach**: Set up a workflow where specific website activities detected by Leadfeeder, like visiting a pricing page, initiate a personalized email sequence from a marketing automation platform like Mailchimp or SendGrid. Tailor the messages based on the content the lead interacted with to increase conversion chances.

- **Slack Notifications for Sales Teams**: Keep your sales team in the loop with instant Slack notifications when a target company visits your site. Use Leadfeeder’s API to monitor visits and set criteria, such as a certain number of visits or specific page views, that will trigger a notification to a designated Slack channel or direct message to a sales rep.
