# Overview

The Formsite API enables you to automate interactions with your Formsite forms. You can retrieve form data, create new forms, or update existing ones, and even manage form submissions. With Pipedream's capabilities, you can integrate Formsite with countless other apps, create complex workflows, and trigger actions based on form submissions or other criteria. It's a powerful way to streamline data collection processes, feed collected data into other systems, or trigger events in other services in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Data Collection to Google Sheets**: When a form submission occurs, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that automatically adds the submitted data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This is great for keeping all responses organized and accessible for further analysis.

- **Dynamic Email Notifications**: Use Pipedream to send custom email notifications via SendGrid or another email service when a form is submitted. You can tailor these emails based on the submission content, ensuring that the right people get the right information at the right time.

- **CRM Integration**: Upon a new form submission, Pipedream can create or update contact records in your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system like Salesforce. This ensures your sales or support teams have the latest information without manual data entry.
