# Overview

The mails.so API enables you to programmatically manage emails, supporting actions such as sending emails and querying sent statuses. With Pipedream, integrating mails.so can automate email operations within business workflows. This API is especially useful for applications requiring dynamic email generation and dispatch, such as automated customer communication, transactional emails, and event-driven alerts.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Feedback Collection**: Automatically send a follow-up email to customers after completing a service or purchase. Use Pipedream to trigger an email through mails.so when a transaction is recorded in your CRM like Salesforce or a payment gateway like Stripe.

- **Transactional Email System**: Build a workflow that sends transactional emails, such as order confirmations or shipping notifications, using mails.so. Trigger these emails from an e-commerce platform like Shopify whenever an order is placed, integrating detailed tracking within the email.

- **Event-Triggered Alerts**: Set up a workflow where mails.so sends alerts based on specific events captured in tools like Sentry for errors or Google Analytics for significant changes in web traffic patterns. This immediate communication helps teams react swiftly to operational or performance issues.
