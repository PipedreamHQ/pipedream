# Overview

What you can build using the Noticeable API

Noticeable is an API designed to make it easier for developers to build
applications and services for healthcare, elderly care, home automation and
beyond. Using the Noticeable API, developers can create and manage applications
that automate everyday tasks and enable social interaction, increase senior
safety, and enable health care professionals to remote monitor their patients.

The Noticeable API lets developers create applications for:

- Motion Detection & Notification: Create motion detection systems, connected
  doorbells and environmental monitors.
- Remote Video Surveillance: Create surveillance systems powered by wireless
  cameras.
- Automation & Robotics: Create robotic cleaners and automated systems for
  senior safety.
- Location & Tracking Solutions: Develop location-based tracking and location
  sharing applications.
- Health & Wellness Monitoring: Monitor health metrics, create health
  dashboards, and gain better insights into the health of the elderly and
  patients.
- Social Interactions: Enable seniors and patients to communicate more easily
  with theircaregivers and connect with other users remotely.
- Home & Hospital Care: Develop applications and services to assist in home
  care and hospital care, including prescription delivery and medication
  reminders.
- Automated Home Care: Automate care for family members that need special
  attention, such as tips for energy efficiency and protection against theft.
