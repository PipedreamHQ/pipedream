# Overview

Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) is a powerful cloud-based email sending service designed to help digital marketers and application developers send marketing, notification, and transactional emails. With the SES API, you can reliably send emails at scale, manage sender reputations, view email sending statistics, and maintain a high deliverability rate. Leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can integrate SES seamlessly into serverless workflows, automate email responses based on triggers from other apps, and analyze the effectiveness of your email campaigns by connecting to data analytics platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Onboarding Emails**: Trigger an SES email sequence when a new user signs up via a web app (like Shopify). The workflow could send a welcome email, followed by onboarding steps, and eventually gather feedback, all automated based on user activity.

- **Real-time Email Analytics Dashboard**: Connect SES with a data analytics app (such as Google Sheets) on Pipedream to track email open rates, click-through rates, and bounces. Each time SES sends an email, Pipedream can log the relevant data to a Google Sheet to create a real-time analytics dashboard.

- **Support Ticketing System Integration**: When a new support ticket is created in a tool like Zendesk, use SES through Pipedream to automatically send an acknowledgment email to the customer, and set up subsequent follow-up reminders, escalating unresolved tickets to senior staff.
