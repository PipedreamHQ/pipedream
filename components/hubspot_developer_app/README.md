# Overview

The HubSpot Developer API provides a wide array of endpoints to manage and automate HubSpot's marketing, sales, and service software features. Using Pipedream, you can connect this API to create custom, serverless workflows that trigger based on events in HubSpot, perform operations on your data, or sync data between HubSpot and other services. This unlocks potential for enhanced lead management, customer engagement tracking, and personalized content delivery, all while reducing manual workload.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Contacts to a Google Sheet**: Automate the process of adding new HubSpot contacts to a Google Sheet. Each time a new contact is created in HubSpot, a Pipedream workflow triggers and appends the contact's details to your sheet, keeping your records up-to-date without manual entry.

- **Enrich HubSpot Contacts with Clearbit**: When a new contact is added in HubSpot, trigger a Pipedream workflow that uses the Clearbit Enrichment API to gather additional data about the contact. This data is then used to update the contact's profile in HubSpot, providing richer insights for personalized marketing campaigns.

- **Automate Slack Notifications for Deal Stage Updates**: Create a Pipedream workflow that monitors changes to deal stages in HubSpot. Whenever a deal moves to a critical stage, trigger a notification to a specified Slack channel, ensuring your sales team stays informed of deal progress in real-time.
