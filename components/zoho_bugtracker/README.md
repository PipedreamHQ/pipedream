# Overview

The Zoho BugTracker API allows you to interact programmatically with Zoho BugTracker, a tool designed for tracking and fixing bugs in your software projects. With this API, you can create, read, update, and delete information related to bugs, projects, users, and more. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to automate workflows, sync data across apps, and optimize bug management processes. Whether it's triggering actions based on bug updates or collating bug reports for analysis, Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform simplifies integrating Zoho BugTracker with hundreds of other apps for seamless automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Bug Tracking Alert System**: Send real-time notifications to a Slack channel whenever a new bug is reported or an existing bug is updated in Zoho BugTracker. This keeps your development team instantly informed about bugs that need attention.

- **Sync Bugs with Project Management Tools**: Automatically create or update tasks in Trello or Asana when a bug is reported in Zoho BugTracker. This helps in syncing development and project management efforts, ensuring that the team is aligned and can track bug resolution progress.

- **Daily Bug Report Digest**: Compile a daily summary of bugs reported, resolved, or escalated within Zoho BugTracker and send it via email using the SendGrid app. This provides stakeholders with a snapshot of the day's bug management activities.

# Troubleshooting

**Issues Connecting My Account: IP Allowlist**

If your Zoho security policy includes an IP Allowlist, update it to connect your account:

1. Add this IP Range: `44.223.89.56` - `44.223.89.63`.
2. Include your current IP Address because the initial OAuth authorization request originates from your browser.
3. Set up a [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/vpc#create-a-new-vpc). Add the [static IP address](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/vpc#find-the-static-outbound-ip-address-for-a-vpc) to Zoho's IP Allowlist. Note: VPCs are available with Pipedream's **Business Plan** or higher. See [pricing](https://pipedream.com/pricing) for details.

After connecting your account, make sure to [run the workflow within a VPC](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/vpc#run-workflows-within-a-vpc).
