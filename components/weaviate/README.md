# Overview

Weaviate is a cloud-native, modular, real-time vector search engine that enables scalable, high-performance semantic search. It's built for a wide range of applications, from autocomplete and similar object suggestions to full-text search and automatic categorization. With the Weaviate API, you can index and search through large amounts of data using machine learning models to understand the content and context of the data. On Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create serverless workflows that automate data ingestion, enrichment, and search capabilities, enhancing your apps with intelligent search functions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Ingestion Workflow**: Ingest data from various sources, transform and enrich it using functions, and index it in Weaviate to create a powerful search database. Connect with sources like RSS feeds, webhooks, or databases on Pipedream to automate the flow of information into Weaviate.

- **Sentiment Analysis and Indexing**: Use Weaviate in conjunction with a sentiment analysis API, like the one provided by Google Cloud Natural Language, to process user reviews or social media posts. Analyze the sentiment of the text and then store the results in Weaviate for searching based on sentiment scores.

- **Real-time Alerting System**: Implement a system that monitors and searches new data entries in Weaviate for specific criteria. When a match is found, trigger notifications or actions through apps like Slack, email, or SMS. This could be used for monitoring brand mentions, compliance, or other critical data points.
