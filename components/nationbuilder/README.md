# Overview

NationBuilder is a comprehensive platform for community organizing, offering tools for website creation, donor management, and communication with the community. The NationBuilder API unlocks potent opportunities for automation and data management. On Pipedream, you can leverage this API to streamline interactions between NationBuilder and other services, automate contacts synchronization, trigger communications based on user activities, and more, all while enjoying the benefits of serverless workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Contact Sync Between NationBuilder and a CRM**: Sync new contacts from a CRM like Salesforce to NationBuilder or vice versa. When a contact is added or updated in Salesforce, the workflow can be triggered, automatically updating or creating a matching profile in NationBuilder.

- **Send Custom Email Campaigns Based on User Actions**: Monitor user activities on NationBuilder, such as donations or signups, and use this data to trigger personalized email campaigns in an email service like SendGrid. For example, thank supporters who've recently donated or send follow-up information to new community members.

- **Create Real-Time Alerts for Key Activities**: Set up a workflow that sends real-time alerts via Slack whenever key activities occur in NationBuilder, like significant donations or new membership signups. This keeps your team immediately informed and ready to act on new opportunities or show timely appreciation.
