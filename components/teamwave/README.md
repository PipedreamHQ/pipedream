# Overview

The TeamWave API offers a conduit to their CRM, project management, and HR software, allowing you to automate workflows, sync data across platforms, and create custom integrations. By leveraging the TeamWave API in Pipedream, you can craft workflows that react to events within TeamWave, manipulate data, and connect to other services to streamline your business processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync TeamWave Deals with a Google Sheet**: Automate the process of updating a Google Sheet with new deals from TeamWave. Each time a deal is created or updated in TeamWave, the workflow in Pipedream triggers and appends or modifies the corresponding row in the Google Sheet, ensuring data consistency and accessibility.

- **Create Slack Notifications for New TeamWave Projects**: Set up instant notifications in a Slack channel whenever a new project is initiated in TeamWave. This workflow helps in keeping the entire team informed and allows for quick actions or discussions related to the new projects.

- **Automate Task Creation in TeamWave from Trello Cards**: Whenever a new card is created in a specific Trello board, trigger a workflow in Pipedream to create a corresponding task in TeamWave. This connection ensures that project management efforts are aligned across different platforms, and helps maintain a single source of truth for task tracking.
