# Overview

The Lusha API provides programmatic access to Lusha's rich database, allowing you to retrieve business profiles and contact information. By integrating Lusha with Pipedream, you can automate the enrichment of lead data, sync contact information with your CRM, and enhance your sales or recruitment processes. The API enables you to pull details such as phone numbers, email addresses, and company data, turning them into actionable insights within your business workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Enrichment in Google Sheets**: Automatically enrich new rows added to a Google Sheets spreadsheet with Lusha. When a new contact is added to the sheet, trigger a Pipedream workflow that uses Lusha to find additional contact details and appends these details to the row. This keeps your lead list rich and up-to-date without manual data entry.

- **CRM Integration for Sales Automation**: Sync enriched contact data from Lusha directly into your CRM, such as Salesforce. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers whenever a new lead is captured via your website or sales platform. Use Lusha to enrich the lead's information and then create or update the lead in Salesforce, ensuring your sales team has all the necessary data at their fingertips.

- **Real-Time Lead Verification for Email Campaigns**: Before sending out a mass email campaign using a service like SendGrid, validate and enrich email addresses with Lusha. Build a Pipedream workflow that processes each email on your list through Lusha to confirm its validity and enhance it with additional lead information, thereby improving your email deliverability and engagement rates.
