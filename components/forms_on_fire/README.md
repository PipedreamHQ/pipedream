# Overview

The Forms On Fire API allows you to automate interactions with your mobile forms. Using it with Pipedream, you can trigger workflows based on form submissions, update or retrieve data from forms, and automate interactions with other apps. It's useful for extending the capabilities of your forms, integrating with third-party services, and streamlining data processes without manual intervention.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Data Entry to a Database**: When a form is submitted via Forms On Fire, use Pipedream to capture the data and insert it into a database like PostgreSQL or MySQL. This workflow can reduce manual data entry errors and save time.

- **Sync Form Submissions with CRM**: Each time a form is completed, the workflow could trigger to create or update a contact in a CRM such as Salesforce or HubSpot. This ensures your customer information is always current and can trigger other CRM workflows.

- **Send Custom Email Notifications**: Configure a workflow to send a custom email notification via SendGrid or Gmail when a form is submitted. This can inform team members about new entries or provide customers with a confirmation receipt.
