# Overview

Documenso API provides robust solutions for document processing and management, enabling users to automate workflows involving document generation, manipulation, and storage. With this API on Pipedream, you can create serverless workflows to automate document-related tasks, integrate with other services, and streamline data extraction and distribution processes. This can significantly reduce manual work, increase efficiency, and ensure consistency across document-handling operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Generation and Emailing**: Automatically generate invoices using customer data from a CRM like Salesforce, then use the Documenso API to format these into professional PDFs. Finally, email the PDF invoices to customers using the SendGrid API on Pipedream. This workflow triggers whenever a new sale is recorded in Salesforce.

- **Contract Template Auto-Fill and Storage**: On receiving a new employee detail from an HR platform like BambooHR, use Documenso API to auto-fill contract templates. Save the completed contracts to Google Drive and simultaneously log this action in a Google Sheets for tracking. This ensures that all new contracts are processed and stored without manual intervention.

- **Real-Time Document Translation and Notification**: Configure a workflow where whenever a document is uploaded to a Dropbox folder, it's automatically sent to the Documenso API for translation. The translated document is then saved back to Dropbox in a specified folder, and a notification is sent via Slack to relevant team members. This is ideal for teams needing quick translations of documents for international projects.
