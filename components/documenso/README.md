# Overview

The Documenso API enables automated document processing and management. It provides functionalities such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting documents, as well as features for tagging and categorizing them. This API can be particularly useful in automations that require systematic document handling, streamlining operations involving paperwork, compliance, or record keeping.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream where incoming emails with invoice attachments are automatically captured. Use the Documenso API to extract data from these invoices, categorize them, and store them in a database. Connect with an accounting software like QuickBooks to update financial records accordingly.

- **Employee Onboarding Documents Management**: Create a Pipedream workflow that triggers whenever a new employee is added to an HR system like BambooHR. Automatically generate necessary onboarding documents using the Documenso API, store them, and share links with the new hires via an automated email.

- **Real-time Legal Document Updates and Notifications**: Implement a workflow where any changes to legal documents stored in a system trigger notifications. Use Documenso API to monitor documents for changes, and upon detection, send real-time alerts to relevant stakeholders via Slack or email, ensuring compliance and timely updates.
