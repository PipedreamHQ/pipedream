# Overview

The Grain API allows users to interact programmatically with Grainâ€™s video highlight features. It enables the automation of capturing meaningful moments from video calls, integrating these moments into various productivity and communication tools, and the management of video content and metadata. By leveraging this API on Pipedream, users can create powerful workflows that enhance project documentation, accelerate team communication, and enrich CRM entries with real-time video data.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Meeting Summaries to Slack**: After a video call on your preferred platform, use Grain to select key moments or highlights. Automatically send these highlights and a brief summary directly to a dedicated Slack channel to keep the team updated. This workflow can be ideal for remote teams who want to stay aligned on decisions and actions discussed during meetings.

- **Enhance CRM with Video Notes**: Integrate Grain with a CRM system like Salesforce. Whenever a sales call is recorded, use Grain to tag and extract important discussions or decisions, then log these in the corresponding Salesforce contact or deal records. This provides sales teams with rich, contextual data to enhance client interaction histories and prepare better for follow-ups.

- **Project Documentation on Confluence**: For project management, automatically push selected video highlights from Grain into a Confluence page dedicated to the project. Include key decisions, milestones, or explanations directly from your project meetings, enriching the project's documentation and making it easier for any team member to catch up or review project statuses.
