# Overview

Grain is a tool designed to capture, share, and organize video meeting highlights in real-time. The Grain API enables users to integrate these capabilities into their own applications or automate workflows on Pipedream. With this API, you can programmatically access meeting recordings, clips, and transcriptions, allowing for rich content management and distribution systems. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, developers can connect Grain with other apps to create automated processes that enhance productivity and information dissemination.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Meeting Summaries**: - Automatically generate summaries of video meetings by extracting key points and action items using Grain's transcription and tagging features. These summaries can be sent via email or Slack, ensuring team members stay updated even if they missed the meeting.

- **Customer Feedback Compilation**: - Gather and organize customer feedback from recorded sales or support calls hosted on platforms like Zoom or Microsoft Teams. Use Grain to clip relevant sections and use Pipedream to store these clips in a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot for analysis and follow-up.

- **Training Module Updates**: - Automatically update training content by incorporating the latest video meeting clips into training modules. When a meeting is tagged with 'training', use Grain to capture relevant clips and Pipedream to upload these directly into an LMS like Teachable or a content management system.
