# Overview

The Grain API allows users to integrate video highlights from meetings recorded on the Grain platform directly into various workflows and applications. This can be incredibly useful for enhancing team collaboration, automating content distribution, and enriching CRM entries with real-time insights from video meetings.

# Example Use Cases

This ensures that team members who missed the meeting can quickly catch up on key points and decisions made, enhancing communication and productivity within remote teams.

- **CRM Integration for Sales Calls**: After a sales call recorded on Grain, use Pipedream to extract highlighted clips where specific products, pain points, or commitments are mentioned, and automatically upload these clips as attachments to the relevant contact or deal records in Salesforce. This provides sales teams with context-rich insights directly within their CRM, improving follow-up effectiveness.

- **Content Generation for Social Media**: Automatically extract highlighted moments from various meetings or webinars recorded on Grain, and use these clips to create engaging content for social media platforms. With Pipedream, you can connect Grain to social media management tools like Buffer or Hootsuite to schedule and publish these clips, driving engagement and showcasing thought leadership.
