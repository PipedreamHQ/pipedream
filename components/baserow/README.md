# Overview

The Baserow API allows you to interact programmatically with Baserow, an open-source no-code database tool. With its API, you can automate database operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. Moreover, it's possible to manage databases, tables, fields, and rows, or integrate with external services to enrich or move data in real-time. Leveraging Pipedreamâ€™s capabilities, you can trigger workflows from a variety of events and connect Baserow to numerous apps for seamless data processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-time Lead Capture to CRM**: Capture leads in real-time from a landing page form and feed them directly into a Baserow database. Use Pipedream to trigger a workflow that enriches these leads with additional data points from external APIs (like Clearbit for business intelligence) and then syncs them to a CRM like Salesforce, ensuring your sales team always has the most up-to-date lead information.

- **Automated Support Ticket Triage**: Automatically create support tickets in Baserow based on incoming customer support emails or chat messages from platforms like Zendesk. Use Pipedream to analyze the sentiment of the inquiry with a tool like the IBM Watson API and prioritize or categorize the ticket accordingly, streamlining your customer service operations and response times.

- **Inventory Management Sync**: Synchronize your inventory management by updating Baserow records each time a sale is made on an e-commerce platform like Shopify. Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for new order webhooks from Shopify, updates the inventory count in Baserow, and if the stock falls below a threshold, triggers reorder notifications to suppliers via email or SMS, keeping inventory levels optimal with minimal manual intervention.
