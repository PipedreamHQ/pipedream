# Overview

The GageList API provides programmatic access to manage and automate calibration records and equipment maintenance tasks. This API is critical for industries where precise instrument calibration is mandatory, like manufacturing, engineering, and healthcare. Using Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate notifications, synchronize calibration data with other systems, and ensure compliance through consistent data management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Calibration Reminders**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream that triggers weekly checks on GageList for equipment nearing its calibration due date. If any are found, automatically send email reminders to the responsible technicians using the Gmail app on Pipedream.

- **Sync Calibration Data with Asset Management Systems**: Create a workflow that listens for updates in GageList, such as new calibrations or updates to existing ones. These changes can then be automatically synced to an asset management system like IBM Maximo, ensuring that all system records are consistent and up-to-date.

- **Generate Compliance Reports**: Configure a Pipedream workflow to monthly extract calibration data from GageList and use Google Sheets API to create and update a spreadsheet that serves as a compliance report. This can then be shared automatically with regulatory bodies or internal audit teams.
