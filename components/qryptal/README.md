# Overview

Qryptal API offers robust solutions for generating and validating secure document QR codes that can be integrated seamlessly into documents for authenticity verification. This is particularly crucial in sectors like education, finance, and government, where document integrity is paramount. Using Pipedream, the API can be connected to a variety of other services to create complete automation workflows, enhancing processes like document management, compliance tracking, and secure exchanges.

# Example Use Cases

- **Document Verification Automation**: Automatically verify the authenticity of documents as they are uploaded to cloud storage solutions like Google Drive or Dropbox. When a new document is uploaded, trigger a workflow that uses the Qryptal API to validate the QR code on the document, ensuring its legitimacy before it's processed or stored permanently.

- **Secure Document Generation for Registrations**: In registration processes where certificates or confirmation documents are issued (e.g., course completions, event registrations), integrate Qryptal with a registration platform like Eventbrite. Automatically generate a secure QR code for each registration confirmation document, ensuring that each document can be verified for authenticity.

- **Compliance Document Handling in Finance**: For financial institutions handling sensitive compliance documents, automate the generation and verification process with Qryptal API. Set up a workflow where every new compliance document is automatically equipped with a QR code before it's saved to a secure cloud service like AWS S3. This ensures all documents can be quickly verified for compliance audits or regulatory reviews.
