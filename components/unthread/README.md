# Overview

The Unthread API enables developers to automate and streamline email and message parsing tasks. By leveraging Unthread's capabilities, users can extract structured data from emails and integrate this information seamlessly into various applications or workflows. This API is particularly useful for processing transaction notifications, support tickets, or any communications where data needs to be extracted and actioned upon efficiently.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Support Ticket Creation**: Automatically create support tickets in a tool like Zendesk or Jira when an email is received. Unthread can parse the email for relevant details (e.g., issue description, urgency level) which can then be used to populate ticket fields in the support app.

- **Event Registration Processing**: When users register for an event via email, use Unthread to parse these registration emails to extract attendee information such as name, email, and preferences. This data can then be added to event management platforms like Eventbrite or a custom database.

- **Invoice Data Extraction and Processing**: For emails containing invoices, use Unthread to parse invoice details (e.g., invoice number, amount, due date) and automatically update accounting software like QuickBooks or create a payment reminder workflow in a CRM system like Salesforce.
