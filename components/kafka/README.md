# Overview

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. Initially conceived as a messaging queue, Kafka is based on an abstraction of a distributed commit log. Since it provides functionality similar to a publish-subscribe messaging system, it's used widely for stream processing, real-time data feeds, and operational metrics harnessing. Integrating Kafka with Pipedream allows you to automate workflows using Kafka messages to trigger events, process data, and connect to numerous other services like databases, notification systems, or even AI models.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time Data Syncing Across Platforms**: Automatically sync data between different business systems in real-time. For example, use Kafka to consume sales transaction data and use Pipedream to process and send this data to Salesforce and a Google Sheets backup.

- **IoT Device Monitoring and Alerts**: Monitor data from IoT devices streamed through Kafka. Use Pipedream to process high volumes of IoT data, analyze it for anomalies or threshold breaches, and trigger alerts via SMS or email using Twilio or SendGrid when certain conditions are met.

- **Stream Processing and Analytics Pipeline**: Construct a real-time analytics pipeline. Capture streaming data from Kafka, process it with Pipedream to calculate real-time metrics or summaries, and push the results to a live dashboard on Google Data Studio or a similar visualization tool.
