# Overview

Apache Kafka is a powerful distributed event streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. Utilizing Kafka with Pipedream allows you to create real-time data pipelines and streaming applications with ease. By connecting Kafka to various APIs, services, and databases available on Pipedream, you can automate workflows, synchronize datasets, and trigger actions based on event-driven data.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time Data Sync between Kafka and PostgreSQL**: Automatically push Kafka messages into a PostgreSQL database to maintain real-time data synchronization. This is particularly useful for analytics and monitoring applications where fresh data is crucial.

- **Stream Processing with Kafka and AWS Lambda**: Process and analyze Kafka streams by triggering AWS Lambda functions. This workflow can be used to filter, transform, or aggregate data in real-time before sending it to other systems or databases.

- **Kafka Event-Driven Customer Notifications**: Trigger personalized customer notifications (via email, SMS, or push notifications) based on specific events or conditions met within the Kafka stream. Integrate Kafka with Twilio or SendGrid on Pipedream to execute this automation.
