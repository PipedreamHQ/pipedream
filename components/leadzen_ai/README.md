# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Scoring and Segmentation Workflow**: Integrate Leadzen.ai with a CRM like Salesforce on Pipedream to automatically update lead scores and segments based on user activity and engagement. This workflow triggers whenever there is a new interaction or update in Leadzen.ai, automatically updating the corresponding lead profile in Salesforce with new scores and segment tags.

- **Email Marketing Automation**: Connect Leadzen.ai to an email marketing tool like Mailchimp on Pipedream. Use Leadzen.ai to analyze lead engagement and segment leads into different marketing campaigns in Mailchimp. This workflow automates the process of sending personalized email campaigns to leads based on their behavior and segment, ensuring that the right messages reach the right audience at the right time.

- **Real-Time Lead Notification System**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream where Leadzen.ai triggers Slack notifications. Whenever a lead reaches a certain score threshold or enters a critical segment, this workflow sends an instant message to a designated Slack channel or directly to sales representatives. This enables immediate follow-up, enhancing the chances of converting high-potential leads into customers.
