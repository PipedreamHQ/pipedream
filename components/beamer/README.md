What is Beamer?

Beamer is a powerful and flexible LaTeX class for creating great looking presentations. With Beamer, you can create slideshows, presentations, and even handouts for your lectures. Beamer makes it easy to create beautiful slides, with or without frames, lists, and tables. Beamer is also very easy to use with other LaTeX packages, such as graphics and color.

Here are some examples of what you can build using the Beamer API:

- A presentation for your next conference
- A handout for your next lecture
- A slideshow for your next family vacation
- A table for your next research paper
