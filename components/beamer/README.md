# Overview

The Beamer API enables you to automate client communication and project management tasks. With Beamer, you can create notifications, announcements, and alerts that keep your team and clients updated on project status, milestones, and deadlines. When integrated with Pipedream, Beamer unleashes the power of serverless workflows to connect with myriad apps, allowing for sophisticated automations that can streamline communications, synchronize updates across platforms, and trigger actions based on specific events or conditions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Project Updates Broadcast**: When a project status changes in your project management tool, such as Asana or Trello, a workflow can automatically trigger Beamer to send an update to a designated channel. This keeps all stakeholders in the loop without manual intervention.

- **Client Feedback Collection and Notification**: After completing a milestone, a Pipedream workflow can prompt Beamer to request client feedback. When feedback is received, it's automatically posted to a Slack channel or emailed to the project manager, ensuring real-time responses and client engagement.

- **Scheduled Announcement Digests**: Compile weekly or monthly digests of all announcements and updates from various platforms like GitHub or JIRA, and distribute them through Beamer. This Pipedream workflow ensures that your team and clients receive a comprehensive, scheduled report of all relevant updates, keeping everyone aligned and informed.
