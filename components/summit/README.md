# Overview

The Summit API enables users to automate and enhance data-driven operations, providing an interface to manage and analyze multiple aspects of business performance through advanced forecasting and financial insights. By leveraging Summit via Pipedream, you can create seamless integrations and automations that connect your financial data with other critical business applications, streamlining processes like budget tracking, expense approval flows, and financial reporting.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Financial Forecasting**: Set up a workflow where Summit generates a forecast report based on current financial data, then automatically sends this report through an email (using the Gmail app on Pipedream) to stakeholders at the start of each month. This ensures all relevant parties are always informed about expected financial trajectories.

- **Expense Approval Notifications**: Create a Pipedream workflow where Summit tracks incoming expense submissions. When a new expense is recorded, a notification is sent via Slack (connected via Pipedream) to the responsible manager for approval. This can greatly speed up the approval process and maintain a log of decisions.

- **Dynamic Budget Adjustments**: Implement a workflow where Summit's API updates budget allocations based on real-time financial data from connected sales and expense tracking platforms (like Salesforce and QuickBooks on Pipedream). Adjustments are calculated and applied automatically, ensuring budgets are always aligned with current business conditions and forecasts.
