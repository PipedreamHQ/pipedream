# Overview

The AirNow API provides access to real-time air quality data from across the United States, offering insights into the AQI (Air Quality Index) for various pollutants. With this data, developers can create applications that inform users about the air quality in their immediate environment or trigger actions based on changes in pollution levels. On Pipedream, one can leverage AirNow's data to automate notifications, integrate environmental data into smart home systems, or even drive data analysis and reporting for health and safety monitoring.

# Example Use Cases

- **Smart Home Air Quality Alert System**: Trigger a workflow whenever the AQI exceeds a certain threshold in a specific location. This could connect to smart home devices via services like IFTTT or Philips Hue to change lighting color as a visible alert or activate an air purifier.

- **Health and Wellness Tracking**: Sync AirNow data with health tracking platforms such as Google Fit or Apple Health. Create a workflow that logs air quality alongside physical activity, providing insights into how air quality may affect respiratory health during outdoor workouts.

- **Environmental News Updates**: Combine AirNow data with a content management system like WordPress to automatically post air quality updates or warnings to a blog or news site. This could be used by local news agencies or community health organizations to keep residents informed on air quality issues.
