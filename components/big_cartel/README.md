# Overview

The Big Cartel API unlocks the power to automate and integrate your e-commerce operations, enabling you to seamlessly manage products, orders, and store settings. With Pipedream, you can harness this functionality within serverless workflows to trigger actions based on store events, sync data across platforms, or personalize customer interactionsâ€”all without the need for dedicated infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Order Fulfillment Automation**: When a new order comes in, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that automatically sends the order details to a fulfillment service like ShipStation. You could also set up notifications to be sent to a Slack channel, keeping your team updated in real time.

- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Integration**: Sync new customer data from Big Cartel to a CRM platform such as Salesforce or HubSpot. Whenever a new order is placed, the workflow can enrich customer profiles with their latest purchases, or add new contacts, aiding in personalized marketing and sales follow-ups.

- **Inventory Management**: Keep your inventory up-to-date by connecting Big Cartel with inventory tracking tools like Airtable. Set up a workflow that adjusts stock levels in your Airtable base when sales are made or when new products are added on Big Cartel, ensuring your data stays synchronized across platforms.
