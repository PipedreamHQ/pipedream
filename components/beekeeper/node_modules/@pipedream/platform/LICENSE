In the event that any provision, including without limitation any condition, of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this Agreement and all licenses and rights granted hereunder will immediately terminate. Waiver by Pipedream of a breach of any provision of this Agreement or the failure by Pipedream to exercise any right hereunder will not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of that right or as a waiver of any other right.
