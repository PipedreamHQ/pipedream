# Overview

The sevDesk API allows you to automate tasks around billing, accounting, and inventory management within the sevDesk platform. With it, you can create invoices, manage customers, and handle your accounting processes programmatically. When integrated into Pipedream workflows, you can connect sevDesk with other apps to streamline your financial operations, trigger actions based on events, and sync data across your business stack, enabling a seamless financial workflow automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Invoice Creation and Emailing**: When a new order is received in an e-commerce platform like Shopify, trigger a Pipedream workflow to create an invoice in sevDesk and email it to the customer automatically. This ensures timely billing and reduces manual effort.

- **Sync Contacts Between CRM and sevDesk**: Keep your CRM, such as Salesforce, and sevDesk contact lists in sync. When a new contact is added to Salesforce, a Pipedream workflow can be triggered to create or update the contact details in sevDesk, ensuring consistent data across platforms.

- **Financial Reporting and Notifications**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to generate periodic financial reports from sevDesk data and send them to services like Slack or email. This can help you keep your team informed about the company's financial health without manual intervention.
