# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Scoring and Prioritization**: Automate the process of scoring leads based on interaction data from Salesflare. Use this information to prioritize follow-ups by creating a workflow that sorts leads into different buckets (hot, warm, cold) and assigns them to the sales team accordingly.

- **Automated Data Sync Between Salesflare and Email Marketing Platforms**: Set up a workflow that triggers whenever a new contact is added to Salesflare. Automatically add that contact to your email marketing platform, like Mailchimp, to ensure your mailing list is always up-to-date and can receive the latest marketing campaigns.

- **Customer Onboarding Sequences Based on Deal Closure**: When a deal is marked as won in Salesflare, trigger an onboarding sequence for your customer. This workflow would connect with project management tools such as Asana, creating tasks for your team to kickstart the onboarding process, and sending a personalized welcome email to the new customer.
