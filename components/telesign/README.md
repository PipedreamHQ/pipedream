# Overview

The TeleSign API furnishes developers with tools for communication and security. You can send SMS messages, voice alerts, and leverage phone number intelligence for risk assessments. Within Pipedream, you can integrate TeleSign to automate notifications, verification, and fraud prevention processes. It fosters real-time, event-driven actions, such as sending an SMS when a new user signs up, or assessing the risk of a transaction based on phone number data.

# Example Use Cases

- **User Registration Verification**: Automate the sending of verification codes via SMS when new users register on your platform. Trigger the TeleSign SMS API to dispatch a secure code and validate user phone numbers as part of your onboarding workflow.

- **Transaction Fraud Alert**: Couple TeleSign's Score API with a payment platform like Stripe. Assess the risk associated with phone numbers during transactions. If a high-risk score is detected, trigger an alert and hold the transaction for further review.

- **Appointment Reminders**: Streamline appointment management by integrating TeleSign with a calendar app like Google Calendar. Set up a workflow that sends SMS reminders when an appointment is upcoming, reducing no-shows and enhancing customer experience.
