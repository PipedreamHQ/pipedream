# Overview

Guru is a powerful API that enables you to build a wide variety of
applications. Below are just a few examples of what you can build with Guru:

- A powerful search engine that can search through a large database of
  documents very quickly.
- An application that can automatically generate comments on documents based on
  their content.
- A system that can automatically tag documents with relevant keywords, making
  it easy to find them later.
