# Overview

The RescueTime API provides access to detailed data about how you spend your time on digital devices, including time spent on apps and websites. With this API on Pipedream, you can create custom workflows that trigger actions based on your productivity data. For instance, you can set up alerts for excessive social media usage or automate weekly productivity reports. Pipedream's platform enables these automations by connecting RescueTime to hundreds of other apps, allowing for intricate workflows that can enhance personal productivity and time management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Daily Productivity Report to Slack**: Send a summary of your daily activity and productivity score from RescueTime to a Slack channel. This workflow could help teams stay accountable and offer insights into work patterns.

- **Focused Work Mode Automation**: Trigger a 'Do Not Disturb' mode on communication apps like Slack or your phone when you enter a focused work session in RescueTime. This ensures you remain undisturbed during periods of high productivity.

- **Time Management Dashboard**: Aggregate your RescueTime data with calendar events from Google Calendar and emails from Gmail to create a comprehensive time management dashboard. This can help you visualize where your time is going and adjust accordingly.
