# Overview

The Fixer API provides real-time exchange rate data for various currencies, making it invaluable for financial applications, data analysis, and e-commerce platforms. Within Pipedream, you can harness this API to create automated workflows that trigger on schedules or events, process currency data, and connect with other services to perform actions such as updating pricing models, sending alerts, or syncing financial data across platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Currency Conversion Alerts**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that monitors exchange rates for a specific currency pair using the Fixer API. Schedule the workflow to run at regular intervals, and if the exchange rate hits a certain threshold, trigger an alert via email, SMS, or a messaging app like Slack.

- **Automated Pricing Adjustments**: Create a workflow for an e-commerce site where product prices in different currencies adjust automatically based on the latest exchange rates. The Fixer API fetches current rates, which are then applied to the prices stored in a data store or database, ensuring all product listings stay competitive and reflect current market conditions.

- **Financial Dashboard Updates**: Build a Pipedream workflow that pulls the latest exchange rate data from the Fixer API at the start of each business day. This data can then be sent to a Google Sheet or a dashboard app like Geckoboard, providing a daily digest of currency fluctuations for financial analysis or reporting purposes.
