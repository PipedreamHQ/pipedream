# Overview

The Cloudlayer API transforms HTML or URLs into PDFs or images, enabling seamless creation of documents and screenshots programmatically. When integrated with Pipedream, you can automate document generation and distribution workflows, trigger PDF conversions based on specific actions within your apps, or archive web content as images for compliance or monitoring purposes. It's a powerful tool for generating reports, invoices, or snapshots of digital content without manual intervention.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Generation and Distribution**: Create invoices as PDFs using HTML templates on Cloudlayer whenever a new sale is recorded in your e-commerce platform (like Shopify). Then, use Pipedream to email the invoice directly to the customer or save it to a cloud storage service such as Dropbox for record-keeping.

- **Dynamic Report Creation for Analytics Data**: On a schedule, fetch analytics data from your preferred platform (e.g., Google Analytics), generate a PDF report via Cloudlayer, and share it with stakeholders via a Slack message or email. This ensures your team stays updated with the latest performance metrics without manual report generation.

- **Website Monitoring and Archiving**: Check your website periodically for uptime or content changes using a Pipedream cron workflow. Use Cloudlayer to capture screenshots and store them in Google Drive or another storage solution. This can serve as a historical archive or a tool for monitoring visual changes on your site over time.
