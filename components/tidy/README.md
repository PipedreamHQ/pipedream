# Overview

The Tidy API offers a range of functions tailored for property management, enabling users to automate tasks like booking cleanings, managing properties, and keeping track of services. Integrating the Tidy API into Pipedream workflows opens up possibilities for automating communications, scheduling, and property management tasks by connecting Tidy with hundreds of other apps. This can significantly streamline operations for property managers, cleaning services, and real estate businesses.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Cleaning Schedules**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream that schedules a cleaning in Tidy whenever a guest checks out in your Airbnb booking system. This ensures your property is always clean and ready for the next guest without manual intervention.

- **Sync Cleaning Status to Google Sheets**: After each cleaning job completion, use a Pipedream workflow to update a Google Sheets spreadsheet with the details. This can help you track cleaning times and maintain records for billing and operational purposes.

- **Send Post-Cleaning Feedback Requests**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to automatically send a feedback request email through SendGrid or a similar email service to the property owner or manager once Tidy confirms a cleaning job is done. This can help in maintaining service quality and customer satisfaction.
