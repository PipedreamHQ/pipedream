# Overview

The Zenscrape API offers a versatile way to extract structured data from any webpage without the hassle of managing proxies or parsing HTML. By leveraging Zenscrape on Pipedream, you can automate data extraction, receive real-time results, and integrate scraped data with hundreds of other services. Create workflows that trigger on schedules or events, process the data, and perform actions like updating databases, sending alerts, or generating reports.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Change Detection and Notification**: Use Zenscrape to monitor website changes. When a target web page updates, trigger a Pipedream workflow, scrape the new content, and send notifications via Slack or email to relevant parties.

- **Competitor Price Monitoring**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that periodically uses Zenscrape to extract pricing information from competitor websites. Analyze the data to adjust your own pricing strategy and automatically update prices in your e-commerce platform like Shopify.

- **Lead Generation Automation**: Implement a Pipedream workflow that uses Zenscrape to scrape contact information from online directories or industry websites. Then, feed this data into a CRM like Salesforce or send it to Google Sheets for further processing and outreach campaigns.
