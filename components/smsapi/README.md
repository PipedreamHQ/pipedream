# Overview

The SMSAPI is a tool that lets you send text messages at scale. On Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create workflows that trigger on various events, like incoming emails, form submissions, or scheduled times, and send SMS messages as part of an automated process. This can help with alerts, marketing, or operational communications. Pipedream's capabilities for connecting to various APIs and services enable complex workflows that can be built without managing your own infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Order Confirmation Texts**: After a customer places an order on your ecommerce platform, trigger a workflow in Pipedream that listens for new orders and uses SMSAPI to send a confirmation text to the customer's phone number.

- **Appointment Reminders**: Connect your calendar or booking system to Pipedream. Use a scheduled workflow to fetch upcoming appointments and send reminders via SMSAPI a day before the appointment is due.

- **Critical Alert System**: Integrate your monitoring tools with Pipedream. Set up a workflow that listens for alerts, such as server downtime or high error rates, and automatically sends a high-priority text message through SMSAPI to your on-call engineers.
