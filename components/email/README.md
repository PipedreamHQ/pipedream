# Overview

The Email API on Pipedream allows users to automate email operations seamlessly within workflows. By integrating this API, you can manage sending, receiving, and organizing emails directly through Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform. This capability is pivotal for automations that involve alerting, reporting, or any form of communication via email, complemented by easy integration with numerous other apps supported on Pipedream.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support Tickets**: Automatically create and send emails to customers when a new support ticket is created in apps like Zendesk or Jira. Use the Email API to notify support staff or directly reply to customer inquiries, ensuring rapid response times and efficient communication management.

- **Invoice Generation and Distribution**: When a new payment is processed via Stripe, use the Email API to generate and send an invoice email to the customer. This workflow can be enhanced by integrating with a PDF generation tool to attach invoices directly to the email, streamlining the billing process.

- **Daily Sales Reports**: Configure a workflow that aggregates daily sales data from an eCommerce platform like Shopify, formats it into a readable report, and uses the Email API to send this report to stakeholders every morning. This automation ensures that key personnel are always informed with the latest sales figures, enabling timely strategic decisions.
