# Overview

SimpleHash API offers tools to easily verify and retrieve blockchain data, simplifying the complexities involved in interacting with various blockchain protocols. With SimpleHash on Pipedream, you can automate workflows to monitor transactions, validate wallet addresses, fetch non-fungible token (NFT) metadata, and more, all in real-time. Pipedream's serverless platform lets you connect SimpleHash with 3,000+ other apps to trigger actions, process data, and create powerful automations without needing to manage infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Blockchain Transaction Notifications**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for new transactions on a specific blockchain address using SimpleHash. When a new transaction is detected, automatically send out a notification via email, Slack, or SMS with services like SendGrid, Slack, or Twilio integrated into your workflow.

- **NFT Metadata Tracking**: Use SimpleHash to track NFT ownership changes. Create a Pipedream workflow that triggers when a specific NFT is transferred, retrieving the new owner's data and updating an Airtable or Google Sheets database with the latest information, making it easy to monitor and analyze NFT market trends.

- **Crypto Payment Verification**: Implement a Pipedream workflow to verify cryptocurrency payments for an online store. When a customer sends a payment to the store's wallet, SimpleHash can confirm the transaction, and the workflow can then update the order status in a Shopify or WooCommerce store and email a receipt to the customer using a service like Mailgun.
