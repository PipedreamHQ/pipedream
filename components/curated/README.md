# Overview

The Curated API enables you to automate the management of your newsletters. With it, you can create issues, manage subscribers, and curate content, all programmatically. This allows for rich integrations with other tools and systems, offering opportunities to streamline your newsletter operations. Using Pipedream, you can harness this functionality to set up custom workflows, trigger actions based on various events, and connect Curated with a plethora of other services to enhance your newsletter productivity.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Newsletter Issue Creation**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream that automatically creates a new newsletter issue in Curated whenever a new blog post is published on your website, using the RSS by Zapier app to monitor the blogâ€™s RSS feed.

- **Subscriber Management Automation**: Keep your Curated subscriber list in sync with your CRM platform. Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for new contacts in Salesforce (or another CRM) and automatically adds them as subscribers to your selected Curated list.

- **Content Curation from Social Media**: Curate content directly from your social media activity. Build a Pipedream workflow that collects your liked tweets or favorited items on other platforms (using Twitter app for likes) and compiles them in Curated, ready to be included in your next newsletter.
