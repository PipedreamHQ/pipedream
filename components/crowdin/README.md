# Overview

The Crowdin API offers a way to streamline localization processes by enabling automated interactions with Crowdin projects. With this API on Pipedream, you can create workflows that manage translations, coordinate with translators, and sync localized content across your apps. It becomes easy to upload new source files, download translations, manage projects, and crowdsource translations, all within the Pipedream ecosystem.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Source File Updates**: Automatically upload new source files to your Crowdin project when you push to a GitHub repository. Combine GitHub and Crowdin on Pipedream to keep your localization files in sync with your codebase.

- **Translation Status Updates**: Set up a workflow to notify your team via Slack whenever a translation reaches a certain completion percentage. This can help in keeping track of project progress and planning release schedules accordingly.

- **Dynamic Content Localization**: Use the Crowdin API with a CMS like Contentful to fetch new content and push it to Crowdin for translation. Once translated, the workflow can update the CMS with the localized versions, ensuring your website or app content stays current in all languages.
