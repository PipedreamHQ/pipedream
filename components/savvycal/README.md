# Overview

SavvyCal makes scheduling meetings less of a hassle with personalized links and overlaying of calendars to find optimal meeting times. The SavvyCal API allows for the automated creation and management of scheduling links, the coordination of calendars, and the customization of scheduling parameters. Within Pipedream, you can integrate SavvyCal with various other apps to streamline your scheduling processes. This means you can automatically create meetings based on triggers from other apps, sync schedules across platforms, or send notifications when new meetings are scheduled.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Meeting Invitations After Webinar Sign-ups**: When someone signs up for your webinar through an app like Eventbrite, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends a personalized SavvyCal scheduling link to the registrant, inviting them to book a one-on-one follow-up meeting.

- **Sync New Meetings to a Google Calendar**: Once a new meeting is scheduled in SavvyCal, use Pipedream to automatically create an event in a Google Calendar, ensuring all your appointments are in sync and accessible across your devices.

- **Send Notifications for New Meetings**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for new meetings created in SavvyCal and then sends a message with the meeting details to a Slack channel, keeping your team informed about upcoming appointments.
