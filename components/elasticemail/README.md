# Overview

ElasticEmail API allows you to integrate powerful email sending and management capabilities into your applications. With it, you can send emails, manage contacts, create and manage campaigns, and track the results of your email marketing efforts. In Pipedream, you can harness this API to automate email workflows, synchronize data with other apps, or react to events with customized emails, all within a serverless environment that scales with your needs.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Welcome Emails**: Set up an event-driven workflow in Pipedream that triggers when a new user signs up on your platform. Use the ElasticEmail API to send a personalized welcome email, ensuring a warm onboarding experience.

- **Scheduled Campaign Reporting**: Build a Pipedream workflow that runs on a schedule, say weekly, to fetch campaign statistics from ElasticEmail. Combine this data with Pipedream's built-in code steps to analyze performance, then send a report to a Slack channel or save it to Google Sheets for easy sharing and access.

- **Dynamic List Management**: Create a workflow triggered by a webhook that monitors user activity. Depending on the behavior, such as purchasing a product or signing up for a newsletter, use the ElasticEmail API within the workflow to add or update user details in the appropriate contact list or segment, keeping your marketing lists up-to-date automatically.
