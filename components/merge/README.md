# Overview

Merge API provides a unified interface to interact with various HR, payroll, accounting, and ticketing platforms. By simplifying the integration process through a single API, it enables developers to create applications that can manage data across multiple services without dealing with the complexities of individual APIs. On Pipedream, you can leverage this capability to automate workflows, synchronize data across platforms, and enhance business processes by connecting Merge API with other apps available on the platform.

# Example Use Cases

- **Employee Onboarding Automation**: Automatically trigger workflows in Pipedream when new employees are added in HR platforms like BambooHR or Workday via the Merge API. This can include setting up new user accounts in Google Workspace, enrolling in benefits plans, and sending personalized welcome emails using SendGrid.

- **Ticket Sync Across Platforms**: Use Merge API to synchronize ticket information between different ticketing systems such as Zendesk and Jira. When a ticket is created or updated in one platform, replicate the change in the other platform using a Pipedream workflow. This ensures consistent information and status updates across teams.

- **Financial Reconciliation Process**: Automate the monthly reconciliation of financial records between accounting systems like QuickBooks and external payroll services. When payroll is processed, use Merge API on Pipedream to compare and verify transactions against bank records and trigger alerts or reports if discrepancies are found.
