# Overview

Merge API provides a unified interface to interact with different SaaS platforms, making it easier to automate workflows involving multiple services. By using Merge on Pipedream, users can seamlessly integrate their data across various applications without writing extensive code. This capability is crucial for businesses that rely on synchronizing data across platforms like CRM, HR, and accounting software. With Pipedream's serverless platform, these integrations can be set up to trigger automatically, respond to events in real-time, and execute complex workflows without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Employee Onboarding Automation**: When a new employee is added in an HR system like BambooHR, use Merge API on Pipedream to automatically create accounts for them in services like Slack, Github, and Trello. This workflow ensures that all necessary accounts are set up instantly, making the onboarding process smooth and efficient.

- **Lead Synchronization Across Platforms**: Sync leads from a CRM platform like Salesforce to other marketing or sales tools such as HubSpot and Mailchimp using Merge API on Pipedream. This workflow can trigger whenever a new lead is added or updated in Salesforce, ensuring that all platforms have the most up-to-date information and can act on it in a coordinated manner.

- **Real-Time Inventory Management**: Connect e-commerce platforms like Shopify with inventory management software using the Merge API on Pipedream. Automate the process of updating inventory levels across platforms when a sale is made or new stock is added. This ensures accurate inventory data across all sales channels, reducing the risk of stock discrepancies and potential sales loss.
