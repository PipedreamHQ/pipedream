# Overview

The Quickbase API enables developers to build business solutions quickly and
efficiently. With it, you can quickly create custom databases and applications
that support your organization. The API supports all the core features
Quickbase has to offer, like records and fields, table-level authentication,
and views and reports. All of these add up to the ability to build powerful
solutions that solve real-world problems.

Below are some examples of what developers can build using the Quickbase API:

- Automated reports and dashboards that present data from different sources in
  different ways.
- Customized applications that store and display data from Quickbase and other
  external sources.
- Workflows and business processes that leverage internal and external data to
  streamline operations.
- Integrations with external systems and websites that pull in data from
  Quickbase and keep it up-to-date.
- A platform for developing mobile applications that access and display data
  stored in Quickbase.
