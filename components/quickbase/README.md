# Overview

Quickbase is a low-code platform for building operational applications and automations that can manage data, workflows, and reporting. Using Pipedream's serverless platform, you can tap into the robust Quickbase API to weave complex workflows that respond to events, synchronize data across multiple systems, and streamline business processes. With Pipedream, you can trigger on events in Quickbase, or from hundreds of other apps, and write Node.js code to integrate with the Quickbase API directly, enabling a broad range of automation possibilities.

# Example Use Cases

- **Project Management Automation**: Trigger a workflow when a new project is added to Quickbase, then send a customized email to all stakeholders using the SendGrid app on Pipedream. This workflow ensures that each stakeholder is aware of the new project and can take relevant actions promptly.

- **Customer Support Ticket Routing**: Detect when a new support ticket is created in Quickbase. Use Pipedream to analyze the ticket's content, perhaps with a natural language processing service like Algorithmia, and then based on the analysis, assign the ticket to the correct department or individual in your customer support tool, such as Zendesk.

- **Real-time Reporting and Alerts**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to monitor changes in critical Quickbase reports, like sales data or inventory levels. When a predefined condition is met, such as low stock on a popular item, trigger an alert and post a message to a Slack channel, so your team can act immediately to restock and avoid missed sales opportunities.
