# Overview

The Zoho Commerce API enables you to interact programmatically with Zoho's e-commerce platform, allowing for the automation of various online store operations. From managing products, orders, and customer data to generating reports, this API opens up possibilities for syncing your e-commerce data with other business tools, setting up automated marketing campaigns based on customer behavior, or even creating custom analytics dashboards to monitor your store's performance.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Order Fulfillment**: When a new order comes in via Zoho Commerce, use Pipedream to trigger a workflow that sends the order details to a fulfillment service like ShipStation. The workflow could then update the order status in Zoho Commerce and notify the customer of the shipment progress.

- **Sync Customer Data with CRM**: Whenever a new customer signs up or updates their profile on your Zoho Commerce store, automatically sync their details to a CRM like Salesforce. This keeps your sales team informed and ensures marketing efforts are based on the latest customer information.

- **Dynamic Inventory Management**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to monitor inventory levels in Zoho Commerce. If a product's stock falls below a certain threshold, the workflow can automatically reorder stock from suppliers and send alerts to your management team.

# Troubleshooting

**Issues Connecting My Account: IP Allowlist**

If your Zoho security policy includes an IP Allowlist, update it to connect your account:

1. Add this IP Range: `44.223.89.56` - `44.223.89.63`.
2. Include your current IP Address because the initial OAuth authorization request originates from your browser.
3. Set up a [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/vpc#create-a-new-vpc). Add the [static IP address](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/vpc#find-the-static-outbound-ip-address-for-a-vpc) to Zoho's IP Allowlist. Note: VPCs are available with Pipedream's **Business Plan** or higher. See [pricing](https://pipedream.com/pricing) for details.

After connecting your account, make sure to [run the workflow within a VPC](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/vpc#run-workflows-within-a-vpc).
