# Overview

The Airparser API simplifies the process of extracting data from emails, such as order confirmations, shipping notifications, or any structured email content. By transforming emails into structured data, it enables seamless integration of email data into various workflows. On Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create automations that act on the parsed dataâ€”like updating databases, triggering notifications, or integrating with other apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support Tickets**: Parse incoming support emails with Airparser and automatically create tickets in a helpdesk platform like Zendesk or Freshdesk. Extract details like customer name, issue description, and priority level to streamline support operations.

- **E-commerce Order Processing**: Convert order confirmation emails into structured data to manage inventory or trigger fulfillment workflows. Connect Airparser to Shopify to update product quantities or to a shipping service to initiate the delivery process.

- **Expense Tracking**: Extract information from receipts or invoice emails. Use Airparser to parse out details such as vendor, amount, and date, and then feed that data into an accounting app like QuickBooks or an expense tracking spreadsheet.
