# Overview

The Ascora API enables interaction with Ascora's business and job management system, allowing for streamlined operations including job scheduling, invoicing, and client management. Through Pipedream, you can craft serverless workflows that leverage the Ascora API to automate tasks, sync data across apps, and react to events in real-time. This can increase efficiency, reduce manual entry, and provide up-to-date information across platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Job Dispatch**: When a new job is created in your CRM, use Pipedream to trigger a workflow that automatically creates a corresponding job in Ascora, assigns it to the appropriate team, and notifies them via Slack or email.

- **Invoicing Sync**: After an invoice is marked as paid in Ascora, a Pipedream workflow can capture this event and update the invoice status in your accounting software, such as QuickBooks or Xero, ensuring financial records are consistent.

- **Customer Feedback Collection**: Post-service, send a survey link to customers through Pipedream. When a survey is completed, trigger a workflow that updates the customer record in Ascora with feedback data, and if necessary, creates a follow-up task.
