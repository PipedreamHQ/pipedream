# Overview

The Taskade API enables automated interactions with Taskade projects, tasks, and workflows. With Pipedream, you can seamlessly integrate these capabilities into cross-application workflows to synchronize tasks, manage projects, and enhance team collaboration efficiency. Automating routine operations with the Taskade API on Pipedream can significantly reduce manual workload, streamline project management processes, and provide real-time task updates across various platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Task Syncing Between Taskade and Google Calendar**: Sync tasks from Taskade to Google Calendar. Whenever a new task is added in Taskade, automatically create an event in Google Calendar, setting the task's deadline as the event date. This keeps your schedule aligned with task deadlines without manual updates.

- **Project Progress Reporting with Slack**: Send weekly updates on project progress from Taskade to a designated Slack channel. Set up a workflow on Pipedream that triggers every week, fetching open tasks from a specific Taskade project and posting a summary message in Slack. This can keep the team informed about pending tasks and overall project status.

- **Task Completion Email Notifications**: Set up an automation that sends an email notification via SendGrid whenever a task is marked as complete in Taskade. Include task details and the completion time in the email to keep stakeholders updated on project progress without them having to constantly check Taskini.
