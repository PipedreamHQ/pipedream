# Overview

The BetterVoice API allows you to automate interactions with phone systems, such as sending and receiving calls, managing voicemails, and creating custom interactive voice response (IVR) systems. Utilizing Pipedream, you can tap into BetterVoice functionalities to craft workflows that trigger actions based on phone events, analyze call data, and integrate with other services for a seamless communication experience.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sales Lead Response Automation**: When a new voicemail is received on BetterVoice, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that transcribes the voicemail using a speech-to-text service, then logs the lead's details and the transcription into a CRM like Salesforce. An automated email or SMS follow-up is triggered instantly, ensuring that potential leads are engaged promptly.

- **Customer Support Ticketing**: Integrate BetterVoice with a helpdesk app like Zendesk on Pipedream. Every time a call ends, a workflow is triggered that creates a new support ticket with the call details, tags it based on the IVR options the caller selected, and assigns it to the appropriate support team.

- **Event-Driven Surveys**: After a call concludes, trigger a workflow that sends a follow-up SMS to the caller using Twilio, inviting them to participate in a customer satisfaction survey. Based on the survey results, which are processed and stored, take further action such as sending a thank-you note, a discount code, or flagging the feedback for review.
