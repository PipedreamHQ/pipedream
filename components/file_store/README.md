# Overview

The File Store API on Pipedream allows you to store and retrieve files as part of your serverless workflows. This is particularly useful when you need to persist data across workflow executions or share information between different steps or even different workflows. You can upload files directly from your workflow, access them at a later time, or serve them via HTTP endpoints. Leveraging this API, you can create dynamic storage solutions that are integrated with your Pipedream automations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Log Aggregator**: Consolidate logs from various sources by creating a workflow that triggers on new log events, processes them, and stores them in the File Store. Use another workflow to periodically process and analyze these stored logs for insights or alerts.

- **User Generated Content Manager**: Manage uploads from a user-facing app. Use a workflow triggered by a webhook to receive content, perhaps validate or process it, and store it in the File Store. This content can then be accessed or distributed as needed.

- **Backup Automation**: Create a workflow that periodically backs up important data from other apps by connecting to services like Google Sheets or Airtable, retrieving the latest data, and archiving it to the File Store for safekeeping.
