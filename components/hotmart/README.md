# Overview

The Hotmart API connects you to a platform where creators sell and distribute digital products. With Pipedream, you can automate actions within Hotmart or sync its data with other apps. For example, you might automate participant registration for a course after a new sale or update customer info across your CRM system. The API provides endpoints to manage products, sales, and affiliates, offering vast possibilities for integration and automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Participant Enrollment**: When a new sale is completed in Hotmart, trigger a Pipedream workflow to enroll the customer in the corresponding online course platform, like Teachable or Thinkific.

- **Sync Sales Data to Google Sheets**: Keep your finance team updated by pushing new sales data from Hotmart into a Google Sheets spreadsheet. Use this data for real-time financial reporting or sales analysis.

- **Update CRM with New Customer Info**: After a sale, use a Pipedream workflow to add or update the customer's information in your CRM, such as HubSpot. This ensures your customer relations team always has the latest data.
