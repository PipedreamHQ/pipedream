# Overview

The NASA API provides a wealth of data related to space, including imagery, Mars weather reports, and information about asteroids near Earth. With Pipedream, you can harness this data to create automated workflows. Whether you're sending daily space photos as a Slack message, saving Mars weather reports to a spreadsheet, or triggering alerts when new asteroids approach, Pipedream serves as a bridge between NASA's data and your applications.

# Example Use Cases

- **Daily Astronomy Picture to Slack**: Fetch the Astronomy Picture of the Day from the NASA API and send it to a Slack channel, including the image, title, and explanation. You can schedule this as a daily inspirational or educational snippet for your team.

- **Mars Weather Report to Google Sheets**: Gather the latest weather report from the Mars InSight lander using the NASA API. Then, format the data and append it to a Google Sheets document for ongoing analysis or public sharing. This is a perfect way to keep track of Mars weather trends over time.

- **Asteroid Watch Twitter Bot**: Use the NASA API to check for near-Earth objects, and then tweet interesting findings from a dedicated Twitter account. You can add filters to only tweet about asteroids of certain sizes or those that come exceptionally close to Earth, keeping your followers informed and engaged.
