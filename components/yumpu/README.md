# Overview

The Yumpu API allows you to integrate magazine and flipbook functionalities into your apps and workflows. Using this API, you can upload PDFs, create magazines, manage subscriptions, and access detailed statistics about your publications. With Pipedream, you can automate interactions with the Yumpu API, triggering workflows with events from your apps or scheduled jobs, and connecting Yumpu to a multitude of other services for a seamless data flow.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Flipbook Creation from New PDF Uploads**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a new PDF is added to a Dropbox folder. The workflow will upload the PDF to Yumpu, creating a new flipbook, and then post the flipbook link to a Slack channel to notify your team.

- **Subscriber Sync and Email Updates**: When a new subscriber is added to your Mailchimp list, trigger a Pipedream workflow to add that subscriber to a Yumpu subscription. Additionally, send a personalized welcome email with the latest Yumpu magazine link using SendGrid.

- **Flipbook Performance Reporting**: Schedule a daily Pipedream workflow to fetch statistics from Yumpu for your latest publications. Format the data and insert it into a Google Sheets spreadsheet for easy tracking and visualization.
