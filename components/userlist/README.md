# Overview

The Userlist API offers a way to manage and engage with your application's user base through targeted messaging and campaigns. In Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate user segmentation, push personalized messages, and track events to create a refined user experience. When you integrate Userlist with other apps on Pipedream, you unlock a powerful suite of functionalities for syncing user data, triggering personalized communication, and responding to user actions in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Users from Your App to Userlist**: Automatically add new users from your database or another service like Auth0 to Userlist whenever a new user signs up. This keeps your Userlist contacts up-to-date without manual entry.

- **Send Custom Event Triggers for User Actions**: When a user performs a specific action in your app, like upgrading their account or completing a tutorial, send a custom event to Userlist using Pipedream's HTTP request action. This can trigger targeted campaigns or in-app messages.

- **Create Segments Based on Activity in Other Services**: Use data from services like Stripe for payment activities or Intercom for support interactions to create dynamic user segments in Userlist. For example, you might create a segment for users who recently upgraded their subscription or submitted a support ticket.
