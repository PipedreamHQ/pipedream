# Overview

LiveSwitch API allows developers to embed real-time communications into applications.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated User Management for Live Events**: Automatically manage user access and roles in LiveSwitch during live events by connecting with CRM systems like Salesforce or HubSpot. For instance, when a new user registers for an event in the CRM, trigger a workflow that automatically adds this user to a specific LiveSwitch channel with appropriate permissions.

- **Real-time Analytics Dashboard Update**: Stream real-time communication data from LiveSwitch to analytics platforms like Google Analytics or custom dashboards built on tools like Retool or Google Sheets. This workflow can monitor user engagement and quality of service during live sessions, automatically updating dashboards that help stakeholders make informed decisions.

- **Enhanced Security with Automated Alerts**: Integrate LiveSwitch with security tools like Slack or email services to send real-time alerts when anomalous activities are detected during a video session. For example, if the system detects an unexpected IP address or multiple failed login attempts, an automated alert can be triggered to notify the admin team instantly.
