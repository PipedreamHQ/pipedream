**Error: "Google cannot give this app access to your account data because Advanced Protection is turned on for your Google Account"**

If you are using a free Google account, [Google Advanced Protection Program](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7539956?hl=en) must be disabled in order to use the Google Drive app on Pipedream.
