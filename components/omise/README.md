# Overview

The OPN API, previously known as Omise, provides a powerful suite of features for handling online payments, from processing transactions to managing payment methods. With Pipedream's integration capabilities, you can automate various aspects of payment operations, link payment events to other services, and streamline financial workflows without the need for extensive coding.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Payment Alerts**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream whenever a new payment is made via OPN. Use this to send real-time notifications to Slack, keeping your finance or sales team instantly informed about new transactions.

- **Customer Follow-Up After Payment**: After a successful payment is processed, use the OPN API to kick off a customer follow-up sequence. Connect with SendGrid to send a personalized 'Thank You' email, and add the customer details to a Google Sheet for future reference and marketing efforts.

- **Monthly Sales Reporting**: Set up a scheduled workflow in Pipedream that summarizes monthly sales data from OPN. Compile this information and generate a report, then distribute it through email or a messaging app such as Microsoft Teams to provide stakeholders with regular updates.
