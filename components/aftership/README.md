# Overview

The AfterShip API on Pipedream allows you to seamlessly track shipments across various carriers, get real-time updates, and manage delivery exceptions. It's a gold mine for automating post-purchase customer communication and optimizing logistics operations. By integrating with AfterShip, you can create workflows that trigger upon shipment status changes, delays, or successful deliveries, and connect these events with other apps to streamline your e-commerce processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Notifications on Shipment Updates**: Enhance customer service by setting up a workflow that listens for AfterShip webhook events, and automatically sends an email or SMS via Twilio to the customer with their shipment's latest status.

- **Sync Tracking Data with a Database**: Keep a centralized record of all shipments by creating a workflow that captures AfterShip tracking updates and stores them in a database like Google Sheets or Airtable. This can help in data analytics, reporting, and ensuring that customer support has up-to-date information.

- **Aggregate Delivery Feedback**: Build a workflow that triggers a feedback request from customers via an email marketing platform like SendGrid when AfterShip confirms a delivery. This can help you gather valuable insights and improve the overall customer experience.
