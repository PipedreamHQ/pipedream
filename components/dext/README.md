# Overview

The Dext API allows you to automate the management of expenses, receipts, and invoices within your Dext account. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to create workflows that streamline your finance operations, such as extracting data from receipts, categorizing expenses, and syncing financial documents across various platforms. By connecting Dext with other apps through Pipedream, you can craft efficient, serverless workflows that save time and reduce manual data entry.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Receipt Processing**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow with new receipts uploaded to Dext. Extract key data with Dext's API and insert it into a Google Sheets spreadsheet for real-time expense tracking.

- **Expense Approval Notifications**: Use Dext to review expenses, then set up a Pipedream workflow to send approval notifications through Slack or email, streamlining the communication process involved in expense management.

- **Monthly Financial Reports**: Build a workflow on Pipedream that gathers all approved expenses and invoices from Dext at month-end, compiles them into a report, and saves it to Dropbox or sends it via email for easy access and archiving.
