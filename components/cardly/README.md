# Overview

The Cardly API empowers you to automate sending personalized cards and gifts to clients, employees, or any recipient with ease. Using Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows that trigger on specific events or conditions, connecting Cardly with other apps to send out physical cards. Automate birthday greetings, thank you notes, holiday cards, or customer follow-ups with handwritten messages, leveraging the power of direct mail in a digital world.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Birthday Cards**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream where a daily trigger checks a Google Sheets spreadsheet for birthdays. When a match is found, it uses the Cardly API to send a personalized birthday card to the employee or customer, ensuring no special day goes unnoticed.

- **CRM-triggered Thank You Cards**: After closing a deal or receiving a donation, trigger a workflow from a CRM like Salesforce. The workflow will send a thank you card via the Cardly API to the client or donor, adding a personal touch to your professional relationships.

- **Feedback Follow-ups**: Post-event or after a purchase, trigger a workflow using a webhook when a customer provides feedback. Use the Cardly API to send a personalized appreciation card or a discount for their next purchase, fostering customer loyalty and engagement.
