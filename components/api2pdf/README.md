# Overview

Api2pdf is a robust API for PDF generation, enabling the conversion of HTML, URLs, and office documents to PDFs, as well as merging multiple PDFs into one. Leveraging this API on Pipedream allows developers to automate document processing workflows, enhancing productivity and efficiency in tasks that require reliable PDF manipulation, such as generating reports, invoices, or contracts from various data sources.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Generation**: Integrate Api2pdf with Stripe or PayPal on Pipedream to automatically generate PDF invoices whenever a new transaction is recorded. This workflow can be set to email the invoice directly to the customer, ensuring timely and professional follow-up.

- **Report Generation from Data Sources**: Combine Api2pdf with SQL database triggers in Pipedream. Automatically generate and send daily, weekly, or monthly reports by converting data query results into formatted PDFs. This is particularly useful for financial, sales, or performance reporting.

- **Contract Creation from Template**: Use Api2pdf with Google Sheets or Google Docs on Pipedream to auto-fill contract templates with data from a sheet or form submission. Once populated, convert the document to a PDF and send it for e-signing to parties involved, streamlining the contract generation process.
