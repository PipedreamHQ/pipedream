# Overview

The Ongage API provides a robust platform for email marketing campaign management, allowing for the creation, management, and analysis of email campaigns. With Pipedream's capabilities, you can automate tasks like syncing subscriber lists, triggering email campaigns based on specific events, and analyzing campaign performance directly within your workflow.

# Example Use Cases

- **List Synchronization Workflow**: Synchronize contact lists between Ongage and a CRM like Salesforce. As contacts are added or updated in Salesforce, the workflow updates the corresponding list in Ongage, ensuring your email campaigns target the right audience without manual intervention.

- **Behavior-Triggered Email Campaign**: Launch email campaigns in Ongage based on user behavior tracked by analytics tools such as Google Analytics. For example, if a user visits a specific product page multiple times but doesn't make a purchase, trigger a personalized discount offer via email through Ongage to encourage conversion.

- **Campaign Performance Dashboard**: Aggregate email campaign performance data from Ongage into a BI tool like Google Data Studio. With each campaign sent, the workflow fetches open rates, click-through rates, and other relevant metrics, providing a real-time dashboard to analyze and optimize your email marketing strategy.
