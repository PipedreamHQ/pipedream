# Overview

Taggun API offers a powerful way to extract meaningful data from receipts and invoices using machine learning. By submitting images or PDFs, it can pull out key details like the date, merchant info, totals, tax amounts, and line items. This capability is gold for automating expense tracking and financial analysis. In Pipedream, you can slice Taggun's prowess into your workflows to parse receipts on the fly, integrate with accounting software, or even manage inventory based on purchase data.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Expense Reporting**: Use Taggun to scan receipts, extract payment details, and then automatically feed this data into a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This can help streamline the process of tracking business expenses or preparing financial reports.

- **E-commerce Purchase Validation**: When customers submit proof of purchase, Taggun can validate the receipt details. Combine this with a Shopify hook in Pipedream to confirm orders, automate loyalty points allocation, or manage product warranties.

- **Inventory Management System Update**: After receiving invoices from vendors, use Taggun to extract product and pricing information. Then, with a simple integration, update your inventory management system, like Airtable, to reflect current stock levels and costs.
