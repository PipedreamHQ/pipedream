# Overview

QuickEmailVerification (QEV) is a powerful API that enables businesses to
quickly and easily verify the accuracy of email addresses. The API reduces the
risk of bouncebacks caused by mistyped or incorrect email addresses, and
ensures that only correct emails are sent out. With QEV, you can build tools
that authenticate email addresses with confidence and accuracy.

QEV is great for any organization that needs to send emails to customers and
prospects. Here are just a few of the ways that you can use the QEV API to
build powerful and useful applications:

- Email Address Validation: Quickly and accurately validate email addresses
  entered by users, or stored in your customer database, to eliminate bad
  addresses and reduce bouncebacks.
- Email Domain Verification: Verify the domain names or extensions of email
  addresses, such as .com, .net, .org, etc., to ensure that they are genuine.
- Email Authentication: Perform SMTP checks to authenticate incoming emails and
  ensure that they actually come from who they say they do.
- Real-Time Validation: Validate email addresses in real-time, to ensure that
  no bad addresses sneak through.
- Bulk Email Verification: Verify a list of email addresses all at once to save
  time and increase accuracy.
- Email List Cleaning: Detect and remove incorrect email addresses from your
  customer database, drastically cutting down on bouncebacks.
- Risk Analysis: Analyze the risk of online fraud associated with certain email
  addresses, helping you to protect your business and customers.
