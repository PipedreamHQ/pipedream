# Overview

The Calendly (OAuth) API allows developers to integrate Calendly with their applications, allowing their users to schedule appointments and events directly from the app. With the API, developers can create, read, update, and delete Calendly event types, invitees, and schedule events on behalf of their users.

Example applications that could be built using the Calendly (OAuth) API include:

- A scheduling app that allows users to schedule appointments and events directly from the app
- An online booking system that allows users to book appointments and events directly from the app
- A calendar app that allows users to view and manage their Calendly events and appointments
- A to-do list app that allows users to track and manage their Calendly events and appointments
