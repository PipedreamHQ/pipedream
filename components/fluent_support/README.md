# Overview

The Fluent Support API lets you interact with your Fluent Support ticketing system programmatically, enabling you to automate ticket management, sync customer data, and trigger actions based on ticket events. With Pipedream, you can harness this functionality to create custom workflows that respond to ticket creation, updates, and status changes, or to integrate ticket data with other apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Ticket Tagging and Assignment**: When a new ticket arrives, use Pipedream to analyze the content and automatically tag it with relevant keywords or route it to the appropriate support agent or team based on predefined rules.

- **Sync Support Tickets with CRM**: Upon ticket closure, trigger a workflow that updates the corresponding customer record in a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot, ensuring that the sales or account management team has the latest interaction data.

- **Aggregate Support Metrics for Analysis**: Schedule a recurring workflow in Pipedream that fetches ticket data on a regular basis, compiles support metrics (such as response time and resolution rate), and sends a report to a data visualization tool like Google Sheets or Tableau for monitoring and analysis.
