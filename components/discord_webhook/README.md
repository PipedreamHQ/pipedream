# Overview
      
With Discord's Webhook API, you can create applications that send messages to Discord channels automatically. For example, you could create a bot that sends a message to a channel every time a new blog post is published, or a message to a channel when someone joins your Discord server.

Here are some ideas for what you could build using the Discord Webhook API:

-  A bot that sends a message to a channel when a new blog post is published
-  A bot that sends a message to a channel when someone joins your Discord server
-  A bot that sends a message to a channel when a new product is added to your online store
