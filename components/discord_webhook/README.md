# Overview

With Discord's Webhook API, you can create applications that send messages to
Discord channels automatically. For example, you could create a bot that sends
a message to a channel every time a new blog post is published, or a message to
a channel when someone joins your Discord server.

Here are some ideas for what you could build using the Discord Webhook API:

- A bot that sends a message to a channel when a new blog post is published
- A bot that sends a message to a channel when someone joins your Discord
  server
- A bot that sends a message to a channel when a new product is added to your
  online store
