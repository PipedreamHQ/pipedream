# Overview

The AI Textraction API allows users to extract text from images and documents, converting visual information into editable and searchable text. This capability can be integrated into workflows to automate data entry, content management, and information retrieval tasks, significantly enhancing productivity and reducing manual errors.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing**: Set up a Pipedream workflow where invoices received as email attachments are automatically processed. The AI Textraction API extracts text from these invoices, and the data is then pushed to accounting software like QuickBooks for payment processing and financial reconciliation.

- **Real-Time Content Moderation for Uploaded Documents**: Create a workflow that monitors a specified folder in a cloud storage service like Google Drive. Whenever a new document is uploaded, the AI Textraction API extracts the text. This text can then be analyzed using a sentiment analysis API or a content moderation service to ensure compliance with content guidelines.

- **Dynamic CRM Updates from Business Cards**: Implement a workflow where photos of business cards taken at networking events are uploaded to a CRM system like Salesforce. The AI Textraction API extracts contact details from these images, and a Pipedream workflow populates these details into the CRM, updating or creating contact records automatically.
