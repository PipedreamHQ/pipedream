# Overview

The AI Textraction API specializes in extracting text from various media files, turning unstructured content like images and videos into structured textual data. This capability is incredibly useful for automating content digitization, data entry, and analysis tasks, facilitating processes where manual text extraction would be too time-consuming or error-prone. By automating text extraction, businesses can enhance efficiency, improve data accuracy, and unlock value from previously inaccessible information.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing**:
  Use AI Textraction to extract text from scanned invoice images. Combine this with Pipedream's integration with accounting software like QuickBooks to automatically update financial records and trigger payment processes. This reduces manual data entry errors and speeds up the accounting cycle.

- **Real-Time Content Moderation in Videos**:
  Implement a workflow where AI Textraction extracts text from video streams or uploads. Use this extracted text to feed into a content moderation API (like AWS Rekognition) to identify and flag inappropriate or sensitive content. This is particularly useful for social media platforms and content providers needing to maintain community guidelines.

- **Event-Triggered Alerts from Scanned Documents**:
  Configure a system where AI Textraction extracts text from documents scanned at a security checkpoint. Integrate this with a database search on Pipedream to check against a list of flagged terms or phrases. If a match is found, trigger an immediate alert via email or SMS through integrations with services like Sendgrid or Twilio. This can be crucial for ensuring compliance and security in sensitive environments.
