# Overview

Mailjet's API offers the power to craft, send, and track emails with finesse. You can wield it to automate email sequences, synchronize email lists with your databases, and send transactional emails with personalized content. It's a playground for creating tailored email campaigns and dissecting campaign performance with rich analytics.

# Example Use Cases

- **Transactional Email Automation**: Automate the sending of transactional emails using Mailjet when users complete specific actions on your app, like signing up, making a purchase, or resetting their password. Use Pipedream to watch for these events and trigger the Mailjet API to send a tailored email response.

- **Synchronize Contacts for Marketing Campaigns**: Keep your Mailjet contact lists up-to-date by syncing them with your CRM system. Whenever a new contact is added or updated in your CRM, a Pipedream workflow can update the corresponding Mailjet contact list, ensuring your marketing campaigns target the right audience.

- **Email Campaign Performance Tracking**: After sending out campaigns via Mailjet, use a Pipedream workflow to fetch the delivery statistics and store them in a database or a Google Sheet. This enables you to analyze delivery rates, open rates, and click-through rates to refine future email strategies.
