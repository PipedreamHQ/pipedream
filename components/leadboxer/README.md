# Overview

The LeadBoxer API lets you track and score leads using web and email behavior data. With this API on Pipedream, you can automate the collection of lead insights, trigger actions based on lead scores or activities, and integrate this data into your CRM or other business tools. By tapping into webhooks and Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows that react in real-time to lead interactions, enrich lead profiles, or sync information across multiple services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-time Lead Scoring Alerts**: Use LeadBoxer data to monitor lead scores and set up alerts. When a lead hits a score threshold, trigger a workflow that sends a notification to Slack, alerting your sales team to follow up immediately.

- **Lead Activity-Based Email Campaigns**: Trigger personalized email campaigns in SendGrid based on specific actions or engagement levels tracked by LeadBoxer. For instance, if a lead views a key page on your site, automatically send them a tailored email sequence to nudge them down the sales funnel.

- **CRM Lead Sync and Enrichment**: Sync lead data between LeadBoxer and your CRM, like Salesforce. When new leads are captured or existing leads show high engagement, update their records in Salesforce and enrich them with behavior data from LeadBoxer for a complete lead profile.
