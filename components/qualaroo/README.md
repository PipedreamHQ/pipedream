# Overview

Qualaroo is an advanced tool for collecting user feedback through surveys and analyzing those insights. With the Qualaroo API, you can programmatically manage your surveys, retrieve survey responses, and integrate user feedback into your data pipeline to enhance decision-making. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to automate the aggregation of survey data, trigger actions based on feedback, and sync insights across various platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Feedback Analysis Workflow**: Retrieve Qualaroo survey responses in real-time via Pipedream, analyze them using natural language processing (NLP) with a service like Google Cloud Natural Language, and store the sentiment analysis results in a Google Sheets spreadsheet for easy visualization and team collaboration.

- **Customer Support Enhancement Workflow**: When a user submits negative feedback through a Qualaroo survey, trigger a customer support ticket in a CRM like Zendesk or HubSpot. This immediate response can help address user concerns quickly, potentially improving user satisfaction and loyalty.

- **Product Feature Request Aggregator Workflow**: Collect and categorize feature requests from Qualaroo surveys, push them into a prioritization tool like Trello or JIRA, and automatically notify the product team via Slack or email. This streamlines the process of gathering user input and turning it into actionable development tasks.
