# Overview

The Roll API serves as a bridge to Roll's project management software, enabling users to automate tasks, manipulate project data, and integrate with countless other apps within the Pipedream ecosystem. By leveraging this API, you can streamline operations, sync data across various platforms, and create custom notifications that power up your project management workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Project Creation**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream to automatically create a new project in Roll whenever a new client is added to your CRM system like Salesforce. This ensures that your project management tool remains in sync with your sales pipeline, reducing manual entry and the chance for error.

- **Time Tracking Integration**: Connect Roll with time tracking tools such as Toggl to automatically update time entries in Roll tasks. Each time an entry is logged in Toggl, a corresponding update can be sent to the relevant task in Roll, providing real-time insights into project hours and resource allocation.

- **Dynamic Reporting and Notifications**: Use Pipedream to craft a workflow where Roll project updates trigger custom Slack notifications. This could include summary reports of completed tasks, upcoming deadlines, or budget alerts, keeping the whole team informed and aligned without constant manual checking.
