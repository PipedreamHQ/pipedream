# Overview

The Microsoft 365 Planner API lets you tap into the robust task management capabilities of Planner within the Microsoft 365 suite. With this API on Pipedream, you can automate tasks, sync Planner data with other services, manage plans, tasks, and buckets programmatically. This opens up possibilities for creating custom workflows to enhance productivity, streamline project tracking, and maintain synchronization across various platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Task Synchronization Workflow**: Automatically sync new or updated Planner tasks to a different task management tool like Trello or Asana. Whenever a task is created or modified in Planner, Pipedream triggers a workflow that updates or creates a corresponding card/task in the external tool, ensuring alignment across your task management ecosystems.

- **Meeting Prep Workflow**: Prior to a scheduled meeting, compile a list of incomplete tasks from Planner and send it via email using the Microsoft 365 Outlook service. This workflow helps participants stay informed about pending items and encourages accountability and preparation before meetings.

- **Resource Management Workflow**: When a new task is assigned to a team member in Planner, trigger a workflow that logs this assignment in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. An additional step could involve checking the team member's current task load, and if it exceeds a certain threshold, send a notification via Slack to the project manager for workload balancing.
