# Overview

Clockify is a time tracking and timesheet app that provides a straightforward way to track work hours across projects. With the Clockify API on Pipedream, you can automate time tracking, create detailed reports, manage projects, and sync timesheet data with other apps. Using Pipedream, you can create workflows that trigger on events in Clockify or other apps, process the data, and perform actions like logging time automatically, sending notifications, or creating invoices based on tracked time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automatic Time Tracking for Meetings**: Trigger a workflow whenever a Google Calendar event starts, automatically starting a time entry in Clockify. When the event ends, stop the time entry. This ensures precise tracking of time spent in meetings without manual input.

- **Project Management Integration**: On task completion in Trello, Jira, or Asana, log a time entry in Clockify corresponding to the task. Additionally, when a new project is created in your project management tool, create a matching project in Clockify to keep both systems in sync.

- **Invoice Generation and Notifications**: After a time entry is completed in Clockify, calculate the billable amount based on the hourly rate and generate an invoice using a service like Stripe or PayPal. Then, send a notification with invoice details to Slack or email to keep the team or client updated.
