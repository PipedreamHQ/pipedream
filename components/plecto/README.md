# Overview

The Plecto API allows you to automate the process of data visualization and performance tracking. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to create real-time dashboards, generate reports, and update KPIs automatically. Pipedream's serverless platform makes it simple to connect Plecto with other services, trigger events, process data, and more. Whether you're syncing sales data, updating leaderboards, or notifying teams of their performance, Pipedream offers a robust and flexible way to streamline these workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sales Leaderboard Automation**: Integrate Plecto with a CRM like Salesforce on Pipedream. Whenever a new sale is logged in Salesforce, trigger an event that updates a Plecto leaderboard in real time. This keeps sales teams informed and motivated with the latest performance metrics.

- **Performance Alerts**: Use Pipedream to monitor performance thresholds in Plecto. Set up an automation that sends a notification via Slack or email when a team member hits or misses a key performance indicator (KPI). Keep the team engaged and responsive by providing instant recognition or support.

- **Data Sync and Visualization**: Connect Plecto to a database like MySQL using Pipedream. Automatically sync new and updated data to Plecto, allowing for up-to-the-minute visualizations in your dashboards. This ensures that decision-makers always have access to the latest data insights.
