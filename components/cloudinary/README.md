# Overview

The Cloudinary API empowers developers to manage media assets in the cloud with ease. It allows for uploading, storing, optimizing, and delivering images and videos with automated transformations to ensure the content is tailored for any device or platform. This API's versatility is key for automating workflows that require dynamic media handling, such as resizing images on-the-fly, converting video formats, or even extracting metadata for asset management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Social Media Content Creation**: When a new product image is uploaded to your ecommerce platform, trigger a Pipedream workflow that uses Cloudinary to resize and optimize the image for various social media channels, then automatically post it to Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter using their respective APIs.

- **User-Generated Content Moderation**: Integrate a system where user-uploaded images are sent to Cloudinary via Pipedream, which then uses Cloudinary's AI-powered content moderation to flag inappropriate content. Once moderated, the images could be stored in a secure bucket on Amazon S3 for approved content, while sending alerts to administrators for review if content is flagged.

- **Dynamic Asset Delivery for Web Applications**: Create a Pipedream workflow that listens for new entries in a CMS like Contentful. Upon a new post creation, automatically trigger Cloudinary to generate multiple versions of the associated images (thumbnails, different resolutions, watermarked versions) and update the CMS entry with the optimized image URLs for faster page loads and improved SEO.
