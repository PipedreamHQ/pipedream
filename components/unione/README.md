# Overview

UniOne is an email service provider that offers a broad range of features for sending and managing email campaigns. Through its API, you can programmatically send transactional emails, organize mailing lists, track email delivery statuses, and analyze recipient engagements. When integrated on Pipedream, UniOne becomes a part of your serverless workflow, enabling you to automate email operations with various triggers and actions from other apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Transactional Email Automation**: Send transactional emails using UniOne API in response to events from your app. For example, you can trigger an email when a new user signs up on your website, automatically sending them a welcome message and login details.

- **Mailing List Management**: Sync a CRM platform like HubSpot with UniOne to manage contacts and mailing lists. When a new contact is added to a HubSpot list, you could use a Pipedream workflow to add or update the contact in a UniOne mailing list.

- **Email Performance Analysis**: Collect metrics on email campaigns from UniOne and send the data to a dashboard tool like Google Sheets or Data Studio. With Pipedream's workflow, you could automate the extraction of open rates, click rates, and bounce statistics, giving you insights into your email performance over time.
