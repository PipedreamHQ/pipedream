# Overview

The Coda API enables you to interact with your Coda docs for both data retrieval and manipulation. By leveraging this API on Pipedream, you can automate document updates, synchronize data across different platforms, orchestrate complex workflows, and react to changes in real-time. Codaâ€™s tables can act as dynamic databases that interconnect with various services, allowing you to streamline operations that depend on the timely and accurate exchange of information.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Coda Tables with Google Sheets**: Automatically update a Google Sheet whenever a row in a Coda table is modified. This workflow can be essential for teams that use Google Sheets for reporting but manage their data within Coda.

- **GitHub Issue Tracker Integration**: When a new issue is created in GitHub, automatically add a corresponding row to a Coda table set up as an issue tracker. This can help engineering teams to stay on top of new issues without constantly monitoring GitHub.

- **Slack Notifications for New Coda Rows**: Set up a workflow where a new row added to a Coda table triggers a notification in a designated Slack channel. This can keep teams instantly informed about new entries, like support tickets or sales leads.
