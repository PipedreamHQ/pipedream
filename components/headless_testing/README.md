# Overview

The Headless Testing API allows you to build and test web applications without
a web browser. This is useful for testing web applications that are not
compatible with web browsers, or for testing web applications that are only
accessible through a web browser.

Here are some examples of what you can build with the Headless Testing API:

- A web application that is compatible with web browsers
- A web application that is only accessible through a web browser
- A web application that is not compatible with web browsers
