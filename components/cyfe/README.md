# Overview

The Cyfe API lets you automate and enhance your data visualization and business intelligence tasks. With Cyfe, you can programmatically create dashboards, add or update widgets, and manage data pushed to these widgets. By leveraging the Cyfe API on Pipedream, you gain serverless execution of workflows, allowing you to connect Cyfe with numerous other services and automate tasks without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Reporting Pipeline**: Use Pipedream to schedule and execute a workflow that fetches data from various sources (like Google Analytics or Salesforce), processes it, and then pushes it to a Cyfe dashboard widget. This turns manual reporting tasks into automated updates, providing real-time insights.

- **Cyfe as a Data Hub**: Build a workflow on Pipedream that collects data from different apps (like social media statistics, support tickets, and server health metrics), and then uses the Cyfe API to populate a centralized business operations dashboard, offering a cohesive view of various business aspects.

- **Event-Driven Alerts**: Configure a Pipedream workflow that listens for specific events, such as a spike in website traffic or a drop in sales. Once an event is detected, it could trigger an update to a relevant Cyfe dashboard widget and simultaneously send a notification via Slack or email, keeping the team informed instantly.
