# Overview

Planview LeanKit API empowers users to automate and integrate their Kanban workflow management. With this API, you can programmatically access boards, cards, and related data to sync with other systems, trigger actions based on board updates, and extract analytics for reporting purposes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Task Syncing with External Project Management Tools:** Create workflows that sync Planview LeanKit tasks with other project management apps like Asana or Trello. Whenever a card is updated in LeanKit, the corresponding task in the other tool is automatically updated to reflect the change.

- **Enhanced Reporting with Data Analysis Tools:** Set up a pipeline to continuously export card data to a data warehouse like Google BigQuery, enabling advanced analytics and custom dashboard creation in BI tools such as Tableau or Google Data Studio.

- **Real-time Notifications of Board Updates:** Implement a system that listens for changes in LeanKit boards and sends real-time notifications to team communication platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams, keeping everyone informed about the latest project developments.
