# Overview

The V7 Darwin API provides robust capabilities for managing and automating machine learning data operations, particularly in image and video annotation for training AI models. Through Pipedream's integration capabilities, users can automate workflows by connecting Darwin to various other apps and services, thereby enhancing productivity and enabling continuous data processing and model training pipelines.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Image Annotation Import**: Automatically import new images uploaded to a Dropbox folder into V7 Darwin for annotation. This workflow triggers each time a new image is added to a specified Dropbox folder, using Pipedream's Dropbox trigger. The image is then automatically uploaded to a Darwin project for annotation, streamlining the data preparation phase for machine learning projects.

- **Annotation Review & Dataset Sync**: Whenever annotations are marked as complete in Darwin, trigger a workflow to sync the annotated data with Google Drive and send a notification via Slack. This ensures that teams are immediately updated about annotation completions and can quickly access the latest annotated datasets for further analysis or model training.

- **Issue Tracking Integration**: Integrate Darwin with Jira to automatically create and update issues based on annotation progress or specific flags. For instance, if an annotation is flagged for quality issues in Darwin, a Jira issue is created to track and resolve this, ensuring quality control is maintained throughout the annotation process.
