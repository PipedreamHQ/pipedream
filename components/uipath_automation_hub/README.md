# Overview

The UiPath Automation Hub API allows you to interact with the automation lifecycle management platform. With this API, you can create, manage, and deploy automation tasks using UiPath's comprehensive toolset. On Pipedream, leverage this API to kick off robotic process automation (RPA) workflows, synchronize automation initiatives with your project management tools, or even gather valuable insights on your automations' performance and impact.

# Example Use Cases
