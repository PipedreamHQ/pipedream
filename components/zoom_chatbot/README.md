# Overview

The Zoom Chatbot API enables the creation and management of chatbots within the Zoom platform, offering a method for automating interactions and extending the functionality of this popular video conferencing tool. In Pipedream, you can leverage the Zoom Chatbot API to automate workflows that respond to messages, post content, and interact with users in chat sessions. With Pipedream's ability to connect to various other services and APIs, you can create complex workflows that trigger actions across multiple applications, manipulate data, or even use AI to analyze and respond to chat content.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Meeting Summaries**: After a Zoom meeting, automatically send a chat message summarizing the key points or action items discussed. You can integrate with a transcription service to parse the meeting's content and then use the Zoom Chatbot API in Pipedream to send the summary.

- **Real-time Support Bot**: Build a chatbot that responds to user queries in real-time. It can fetch answers from an FAQ database, or create a ticket in a service like Zendesk if the question needs further attention. The chatbot uses the Zoom Chatbot API in Pipedream to reply to the user directly in the Zoom chat.

- **Chat Analytics and Reports**: Process chat messages to generate analytics, like the most common questions or keywords used in a specific time frame. Use the Zoom Chatbot API in Pipedream to collect chat data, send it to a data analysis tool, and then post periodic reports back to your team's Zoom Chat.
