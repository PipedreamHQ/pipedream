# Overview

The Patreon API allows creators to integrate their membership platform directly into external applications, enabling automation and enhancing member experiences. With Pipedream, you can leverage this capability to create workflows that respond to new patrons, process payments, and synchronize patron data across various services. This direct integration within Pipedream workflows can trigger actions in other apps, send custom notifications, or manage content based on patron interactions and membership changes.

## Example Use Cases

- **New Patron Welcome Messages**: Automatically send a personalized welcome email to new patrons using the Gmail app when they join your Patreon community.

- **Discord Role Management**: Assign Discord roles based on Patreon membership levels by connecting Patreon to Discord in Pipedream. When a user becomes a patron of a certain tier, update their role in Discord to reflect their membership status.

- **Membership Analytics Dashboard**: Sync patron data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet to create a live analytics dashboard. Each time a patron updates their pledge, add or update their information in a sheet to track membership changes and revenue over time.
