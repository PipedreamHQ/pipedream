# Overview

Pipedream's integration with the Patreon API enables creators to automate interactions with their patrons, manage memberships, and streamline content delivery. By leveraging Pipedream's ability to connect with hundreds of apps, creators can set up custom workflows that trigger actions based on Patreon events, like new pledges, or that perform regular tasks, like sending messages to patrons.

# Example Use Cases

- **Auto-Thank New Patrons**: Trigger a workflow when a new patron joins and automatically send a personalized thank you email via SendGrid or another email service provider connected to Pipedream.

- **Patron Milestone Celebrations**: Set up a workflow that tracks the number of patrons and posts celebratory messages on social media platforms like Twitter when certain milestones are reached.

- **Exclusive Content Delivery**: Create a system where new posts on Patreon trigger a workflow that sends exclusive content links to qualifying patrons through platforms like Slack or Discord.
