# Overview

Pipedream's integration with the Patreon API enables creators to automate interactions with their patrons, manage memberships, and streamline content delivery. By leveraging Pipedream's ability to connect with 3,000+ apps, creators can set up custom workflows that trigger actions based on Patreon events, like new pledges, or that perform regular tasks, like sending messages to patrons.

# Example Use Cases

- **Auto-Thank New Patrons**: Trigger a workflow when a new patron joins and automatically send a personalized thank you email via SendGrid or another email service provider connected to Pipedream.

- **Patron Milestone Celebrations**: Set up a workflow that tracks the number of patrons and posts celebratory messages on social media platforms like Twitter when certain milestones are reached.

- **Exclusive Content Delivery**: Create a system where new posts on Patreon trigger a workflow that sends exclusive content links to qualifying patrons through platforms like Slack or Discord.
