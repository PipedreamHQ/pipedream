# Overview

The Uscreen API lets you programmatically access your video on demand and OTT (over-the-top) service. With this API, you can pull data about videos, users, and sales, and carry out actions like creating and updating users, and more. By leveraging the Uscreen API on Pipedream, you can automate workflows involving video content management, user engagement tracking, and sales monitoring. This can significantly cut down manual effort and streamlines operations within your Uscreen account.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated User Onboarding**: Set up a workflow that listens for new user sign-ups via a webhook, then uses the Uscreen API to automatically send personalized welcome emails or SMS messages, perhaps integrating with SendGrid or Twilio for messaging capabilities.

- **Content Syncing with Social Media**: Whenever you upload a new video to Uscreen, trigger a workflow that posts a tailored announcement with a link to the new content on your social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook, driving engagement and keeping your audience informed.

- **Sales Reporting to Google Sheets**: Configure a scheduled workflow that regularly fetches sales and subscription data from Uscreen and populates a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This allows for easy tracking of revenue trends and the creation of visual reports without manual data entry.
