# Overview

The DoneDone API opens a realm of possibilities for tracking issues and managing projects within Pipedream's serverless platform. By harnessing this API, you can automate ticket creation, update project statuses, and streamline collaboration with your team. DoneDone's simple yet powerful API provides endpoints to manage tasks, projects, people, and more, effectively becoming a backbone for your project management workflow automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Issue Reporting from Support Emails**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream when a new email arrives in a dedicated support mailbox (e.g., Gmail). Parse the email content and automatically create a new issue in DoneDone, including relevant details such as the sender's information and the issue description.

- **Project Management Sync with Google Calendar**: Whenever a new project or milestone is added in DoneDone, use this event to trigger a Pipedream workflow that creates a corresponding event in Google Calendar. This keeps your team's schedule synced and ensures all deadlines are visible and tracked outside of DoneDone as well.

- **Slack Notifications for DoneDone Issue Updates**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to listen for status updates on issues within DoneDone. When an issue is updated, automatically send a message to a designated Slack channel or direct message to a team member, providing instant updates on ticket progress without needing to check DoneDone.
