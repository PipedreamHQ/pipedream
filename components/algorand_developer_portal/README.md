# Overview

The Algorand Developer Portal API allows you to interact with the Algorand blockchain, performing operations like checking account balances, creating transactions, and reading the current state of the blockchain. When used within Pipedream, you can automate workflows that respond to real-time events on the blockchain, integrate with other APIs for cross-platform actions, or analyze blockchain data to inform business decisions.

## Example Algorand Developer Portal Workflows on Pipedream

- **Automated Asset Tracking**: Create a workflow that triggers on a schedule to fetch the balance and asset details for specified Algorand accounts. Use this data to update a Google Sheet, sending an email alert if certain assets exceed a threshold value, integrating with the Google Sheets and Gmail apps on Pipedream.

- **Transaction Alerting System**: Build a Pipedream workflow triggered by webhooks that listens for specific transaction events on the Algorand blockchain. When a transaction meets your criteria, send a Slack message to a designated channel using the Slack app on Pipedream, keeping your team immediately informed about high-priority transactions.

- **Blockchain Analytics Dashboard**: Set up a workflow that periodically calls the Algorand Developer Portal API to retrieve recent block data. Process this data to extract insights and trends, then push the results to a service like Datadog or a custom dashboard, enabling you to visualize blockchain operations and performance metrics over time.
