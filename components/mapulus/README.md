# Overview

Mapulus API enables you to integrate advanced mapping, routing, and geospatial capabilities into your applications. With Pipedream, you can create powerful workflows that leverage the Mapulus API to automate tasks such as generating optimized routes, geocoding addresses, or analyzing geographic data. By connecting Mapulus to other apps available on Pipedream, you can enrich your business processes, enhance data analytics, or create dynamic location-based services without writing code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Dynamic Route Optimization for Deliveries**: Automate the process of optimizing delivery routes by connecting Mapulus with a scheduling app like Google Calendar. Whenever a new delivery is scheduled, a workflow triggers on Pipedream to send the address to Mapulus to calculate the most efficient route and update the Calendar event with the estimated time of arrival.

- **Geofencing Alerts for Asset Tracking**: Combine Mapulus with a real-time messaging app like Slack to create geofencing alerts. Set up a workflow on Pipedream where Mapulus monitors the location of assets, and when they enter or exit a predefined geofenced area, an alert is automatically sent to a dedicated Slack channel to notify the team.

- **Customer Location Data Enrichment**: Integrate Mapulus with a CRM platform like Salesforce to enrich customer profiles. Create a Pipedream workflow that triggers when new customer data is added to Salesforce. The workflow sends the customer address to Mapulus for geocoding and then updates the customer record in Salesforce with precise location data, helping with market segmentation and targeted marketing efforts.
