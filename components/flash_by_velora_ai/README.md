# Overview

The Flash API by Velora AI empowers developers to enhance their applications with advanced AI-driven image processing capabilities. The API offers tools for tasks like object detection, image classification, and feature recognition, making it ideal for building intelligent, automated workflows in diverse fields such as security, e-commerce, and media management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Moderation in Social Networks**: Integrate Flash API with Twitter using Pipedream to automatically detect and flag inappropriate content in user-uploaded images. This workflow could monitor images posted on specific Twitter handles or hashtags, use Flash API to analyze the content, and then tag or remove images based on predefined criteria.

- **E-commerce Product Catalog Enhancement**: Use Flash API on Pipedream to automatically categorize and tag new product images uploaded to a Shopify store. This can help improve searchability and organization of products by automatically adding metadata like color, type, and material detected in the images.

- **Real-time Surveillance Alerts**: Connect Flash API with Telegram on Pipedream to create a real-time alert system for security cameras. Images captured by the cameras can be sent to the Flash API for object recognition, and if specific objects or anomalies are detected, instant notifications can be sent to a designated Telegram channel or group.
