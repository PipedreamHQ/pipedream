# Overview

The Kucoin Futures API allows developers to programmatically access Kucoin's
futures trading functionality. Using the API, developers can create
applications that can trade futures contracts on Kucoin's platform.

Here are some examples of what you can build using the Kucoin Futures API:

- A futures trading bot that automatically trades contracts on Kucoin's
  platform
- A mobile app that lets users trade futures contracts on Kucoin
- A web app that shows real-time data for Kucoin's futures markets
- A trading platform that integrated with Kucoin's API to allow for trading
  futures contracts
