# Overview

The EZ Texting API allows you to automate SMS messaging, making it a breeze to send bulk messages, set up marketing campaigns, or deliver notifications. On Pipedream, you can harness this power to create custom workflows that trigger based on various events or schedules. Think of syncing your CRM contacts, automating alerts, or even integrating with other apps to expand your communication strategy.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Follow-Up**: After a customer submits a form on your website, you can build a workflow that captures that event, extracts the customer's phone number, and sends a follow-up text via EZ Texting. This ensures immediate engagement and can improve customer satisfaction.

- **Scheduled Appointment Reminders**: If you have a calendar or booking system, you can connect it to EZ Texting through Pipedream to automatically send SMS reminders for appointments. Schedule a workflow that checks upcoming appointments daily and texts reminders to reduce no-shows.

- **Alerts From Monitoring Systems**: Combine EZ Texting with a monitoring app like Uptime Robot on Pipedream to promptly notify the relevant team via SMS if a website or service goes down, ensuring quick response times and minimizing downtime.
