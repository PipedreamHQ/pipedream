# Example Use Cases

- **Data Synchronization between Bubble and Google Sheets**: Listen for new entries in your Bubble app's database and sync them to a Google Sheet in real time. This workflow can be used for sharing updates with a team that prefers working within spreadsheets or for archiving data externally.

- **User Onboarding Sequence with SendGrid**: Kick off a user onboarding sequence via email using SendGrid whenever a new user signs up in your Bubble app. This can include a welcome email followed by a sequence of educational content or usage tips, helping to engage users right from the start.

- **Support Ticket Escalation using Slack**: Monitor your Bubble app's support ticket system and post messages to a designated Slack channel when tickets meet certain criteria, such as high priority or staying unresolved for a specific time frame. This workflow ensures critical issues gain immediate attention.
