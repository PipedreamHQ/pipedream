# Overview

Onbee.appâ€™s API allows users to streamline and automate operations within their business platforms, particularly in areas like customer management and task scheduling. Coupled with Pipedream, users can automate interactions between Onbee and other popular apps, gaining efficiency in data synchronization, triggering events based on specific conditions, and enhancing overall business processes management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Onboarding Automation**: When a new customer is added in Onbee, automatically enroll them in a welcome email sequence in Mailchimp and create a new contact in Salesforce. This streamlines the onboarding process, ensuring consistent communication and keeping CRM data up-to-date.

- **Appointment Reminder System**: Set up a workflow where upcoming appointments registered in Onbee trigger SMS reminders to clients via Twilio 24 hours before their appointment. This can reduce no-shows and enhance customer satisfaction by ensuring clients remember their scheduled times.

- **Feedback Collection Post-Service**: After a service is marked as completed in Onbee, trigger an email through SendGrid asking for customer feedback. This feedback can be automatically parsed and stored in a Google Sheet for easy review and action, helping to improve service quality and customer engagement.
