# Overview

Onbee.app API facilitates the creation, management, and tracking of digital assets and experiences, making it ideal for gamification, loyalty programs, and digital marketing initiatives. By leveraging the API on Pipedream, users can automate processes, sync data across platforms, and create dynamic interactions based on user behaviors or predefined triggers. This integration opens up possibilities for real-time data flows and tailored user engagement strategies.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Loyalty Reward Automation**: Automatically update customer loyalty points on Onbee.app whenever a purchase is recorded in Shopify. This workflow triggers whenever there's a new order in Shopify, using the Shopify trigger on Pipedream. The resulting data is then passed to Onbee.app to adjust the customer's loyalty points, enhancing the customer experience and encouraging repeat business.

- **Event-driven Content Unlocking**: Set up a workflow where participants in an online course (hosted on platforms like Teachable or Kajabi) unlock digital badges or content on Onbee.app upon completing certain milestones. Use webhook triggers from the course platform to notify Pipedream of the milestone completion, which then communicates with Onbee.app to unlock the specific content or badge.

- **Automated Marketing Campaigns Based on User Activity**: Integrate Onbee.app with Mailchimp to send personalized email campaigns based on user activities or achievements tracked in Onbee.app. For instance, when a user reaches a new level or milestone in a gamification setup managed by Onbee.app, trigger an automated email from Mailchimp congratulating them and perhaps offering a discount or special offer to further engage them.
