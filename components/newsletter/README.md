# Overview

The Newsletter API provides a way to integrate and automate email campaign management directly within Pipedream. With this API, you can manage subscribers, send out newsletters, and analyze the performance of your email campaigns. It's a powerful tool for website owners, bloggers, and marketers who want to engage their audience through regular email updates.

# Example Use Cases
