# Overview

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central API enables you to streamline business processes by automating tasks and integrating with other services. With this API, you can access Dynamics 365 Business Central data such as financials, sales, service, and operations. It's perfect for creating custom workflows in Pipedream that can manipulate data, synchronize information across platforms, generate reports, and notify team members of important events.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing**: When a new sale is recorded in another app like Shopify, use Pipedream to automatically create an invoice in Dynamics 365 Business Central, record the transaction, and send a confirmation email to the customer via SendGrid.

- **Inventory Management**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream that monitors stock levels in Dynamics 365 Business Central. When inventory for a particular item falls below a threshold, generate a purchase order, and send it to the supplier using an email service like Mailgun, or directly post it to a supplier's portal via webhooks.

- **Customer Relationship Updates**: Whenever a customer's details are updated in a CRM like Salesforce, use Pipedream to reflect those changes in Dynamics 365 Business Central. Additionally, segment customers based on their purchase history or interactions and enrich their profiles for targeted marketing campaigns.
