# Overview

The Docnify API enables automated document management and processing, allowing users to create, retrieve, update, and delete documents programmatically. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where document workflows need to be integrated with other business processes, such as CRM systems, project management tools, or custom databases.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Document Generation and Emailing**: In Pipedream, integrate Docnify with email services like Gmail to automate the creation of documents based on triggers (e.g., new sales lead in CRM) and then email these documents directly to clients or staff.

- **Document Approval Workflows**: Use the Docnify API on Pipedream to create documents and then integrate with Slack for notifications. Set up a workflow where once a document is created, a notification is sent to a Slack channel requesting approval. Upon approval, the document can be automatically moved to a different status or updated with approval metadata.

- **Data Backup to Cloud Storage**: Combine Docnify with cloud storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox on Pipedream. Automatically backup important documents by creating a workflow that triggers upon document update or creation in Docnify, then saves a copy to the designated cloud storage solution.
