# Overview

Docnify is a powerful API that simplifies handling and automating document-based processes. It enables users to create, retrieve, update, and delete documents programmatically. Integrated with Pipedream, Docnify can automate tasks across different platforms, sync data with other apps, or trigger events based on document actions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing**: Deploy a workflow where Docnify creates invoices and sends them automatically through email apps like SendGrid or Mailgun when a new order is placed in e-commerce platforms like Shopify or WooCommerce.

- **Document Approval Flows**: Set up a system where documents created in Docnify are sent to a Slack channel or Microsoft Teams for review. Once approved, the document can be automatically stored in Google Drive or Dropbox.

- **Auto-generate Reports and Analytics**: Build a workflow that triggers Docnify to generate monthly sales reports. These reports can then be automatically pushed to data visualization tools like Google Sheets or Tableau for analytics and shared with relevant stakeholders via email.
