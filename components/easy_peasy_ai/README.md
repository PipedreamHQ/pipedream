# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Automatically analyze customer feedback submitted via forms or emails. Use Easy-Peasy.AI's text analysis capabilities to determine sentiment and categorize feedback by topics. This processed data can trigger specific workflows in Pipedream, like creating tickets in customer support tools (e.g., Zendesk) or updating a CRM record.

- **Image-Based Content Moderation**: In platforms where users upload images, use Easy-Peasy.AI to analyze and automatically flag inappropriate content. This workflow could integrate with communication platforms like Slack to alert moderators or directly remove the content from the platform if it violates guidelines.

- **Real-Time Translation for Global Teams**: For companies operating globally, real-time communication can often be hindered by language barriers. Set up a workflow where chat messages (e.g., from Slack) are automatically translated using Easy-Peasy.AIâ€™s language translation services and posted back in a common channel to facilitate seamless communication across different language-speaking teams.
