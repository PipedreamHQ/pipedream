The Ringover API allows you to automate and integrate telephony features with your existing apps and services. With Pipedream and Ringover, you can create serverless workflows that handle voice and SMS events, manage contacts, and analyze call data without the need for a backend infrastructure. By leveraging Pipedream's capability to connect with various APIs, you can sync Ringover activities with CRM systems, support tickets, messaging platforms, and more, all in real time.

# Example Use Cases

**Log Incoming Calls in Google Sheets**
Automatically log details of incoming calls in a Google Sheet for record-keeping and analysis. Each time a call is received on Ringover, a new row is added to the sheet with the caller's information and call duration.

**Sync Missed Calls with Slack Notifications**
Stay on top of missed calls by creating a workflow that sends a Slack message to a designated channel or user when a call is missed on Ringover. This ensures immediate awareness and follow-up.

**Create Contacts from Sign-Up Forms**
When a user signs up via a web form, automatically create a new contact in Ringover's address book. This can help sales and support teams to quickly reach out to new leads or customers with streamlined communication.
