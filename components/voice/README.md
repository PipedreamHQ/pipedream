# Overview

The Voiceflow API provides programmatic access to Voiceflow's conversational AI platform, enabling users to create, update, and deploy voice and chat applications. Through Pipedream, developers can automate workflows involving Voiceflow projects, such as syncing conversation designs with external tools, triggering customer support messages based on user interactions, or compiling analytics from user sessions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Syncing of Voiceflow Projects**: Integrate GitHub with Voiceflow using Pipedream to automatically commit changes in your Voiceflow projects to a repository. Each time a project is updated in Voiceflow, Pipedream triggers a workflow that pushes the latest version to GitHub, ensuring version control and backup for your conversational apps.

- **User Interaction Triggered Support Tickets**: Connect Voiceflow with Zendesk via Pipedream. When a user encounters an issue or requests help in a Voiceflow-powered chatbot, Pipedream captures the event and creates a support ticket in Zendesk with the user's query and contact details, streamlining customer support follow-ups.

- **Voiceflow Analytics to Google Sheets**: Use Pipedream to send session data from Voiceflow to Google Sheets. After a conversation ends in a Voiceflow application, Pipedream can automatically extract the session details and append them to a Google Sheet, providing easy-to-analyze data for improving user experiences.
