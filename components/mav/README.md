# Overview

The Mav API allows for automated, conversational marketing via SMS, engaging leads and customers through personalized messaging. On Pipedream, you can tap into this capability to create workflows that trigger actions within Mav based on various events or conditions. For example, you can add new leads into Mav's system, update contacts, or send out messages based on triggers from other apps or scheduled times.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Qualification Automation**: When a lead fills out a form on your website, use Pipedream to send that data to the Mav API, triggering a personalized SMS conversation to qualify the lead. Combine this with Google Sheets on Pipedream to log interactions for later review.

- **Customer Feedback Collection**: After a customer purchase is recorded in your CRM, such as Salesforce, use Pipedream to initiate a Mav SMS conversation asking for feedback. This can help quickly capture customer sentiment and identify areas for improvement.

- **Event Reminder Messages**: Schedule Pipedream to trigger Mav SMS reminders to attendees of an upcoming event, using a calendar event from Google Calendar as the input. Personalize the message based on attendee data to increase engagement.
