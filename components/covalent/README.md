# Overview

The Covalent API provides comprehensive blockchain data from multiple chains, enabling the retrieval of balances, transactions, and contract details with a simple API call. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to create powerful automations and workflows that respond to blockchain events, aggregate data for analysis, and integrate with other apps for a wide array of use cases, such as notifying users of transaction events or updating databases with the latest blockchain states.

# Example Use Cases

- **Crypto Portfolio Tracker**: Build a workflow that periodically fetches the balance and transaction history of wallet addresses across various blockchains using the Covalent API. Send this data to a Google Sheet using the Google Sheets app on Pipedream for an easy-to-use portfolio tracking solution.

- **Real-time Transaction Alerts**: Set up a workflow that listens for new transactions to specific wallet addresses using Covalent API. When a new transaction is detected, trigger an alert via Twilio's SMS service or send a Discord notification to keep stakeholders informed in real time.

- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Opportunity Monitor**: Create a workflow that uses the Covalent API to scan for profitable opportunities in DeFi protocols. Aggregate current rates and positions, compare against historical data stored in a Pipedream data store, and use this information to email a curated list of opportunities via the SendGrid app, helping users make timely investment decisions.
