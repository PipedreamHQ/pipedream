# Overview

The Bolt IoT API lets you harness the power of your Bolt IoT devices, enabling you to control and monitor them remotely through Pipedream. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create automated workflows that trigger on specific events, process data, and integrate with countless other services. Whether you're aiming to automate your smart home, set up alerts, or manage device data, Pipedream makes it straightforward to connect Bolt IoT with a world of apps and services for a seamless automation experience.

# Example Use Cases

- **Temperature Alert System:** Set up a Bolt IoT device to monitor temperature. Use Pipedream to listen for temperature readings that exceed a set threshold and automate sending an alert via email or SMS through integrations with SendGrid or Twilio.

- **Smart Irrigation Scheduler:** Create a workflow where the Bolt IoT API reports soil moisture levels to Pipedream, which then triggers a smart irrigation system via IFTTT or directly controls a smart plug connected to a water pump, ensuring plants are watered optimally.

- **Energy Consumption Monitor:** Leverage Pipedream to collect energy usage data from your Bolt IoT equipped devices. Analyze the data and generate reports or visualizations with Google Sheets or Tableau. Use Pipedream to schedule regular updates and share insights with stakeholders automatically.
