# Overview

The Addressfinder API provides robust data solutions for address validation, geocoding, and autocomplete for Australian and New Zealand addresses. This API can significantly enhance user experience by streamlining the input process in forms, reducing errors in address entry, and ensuring that all address data is consistent and accurate. When used with Pipedream, Addressfinder can trigger workflows based on address lookups, validate customer data in real-time, and synchronize address data across multiple platforms, making it an essential tool for businesses looking to improve data quality, customer interaction, and operational efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Onboarding Automation**: When a new customer signs up on your platform, use Addressfinder to validate and standardize the address they provide. This can be paired with a CRM like Salesforce in Pipedream. Automatically add the standardized address to the customer's profile in Salesforce, ensuring that all correspondence and shipments are sent to the correct location.

- **Event Registration Check-In**: For events requiring pre-registration, use Addressfinder to streamline the check-in process. As attendees register online, use Addressfinder via Pipedream to validate their address data. At the event, quickly verify addresses against the validated list to expedite entry and improve security.

- **E-Commerce Shipping Automation**: Integrate Addressfinder with an e-commerce platform like Shopify using Pipedream. When a customer places an order, automatically validate and correct the shipping address. This reduces shipping errors, returns, and unhappy customers while ensuring efficient logistics.
