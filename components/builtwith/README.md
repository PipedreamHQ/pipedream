# Overview

The BuiltWith API on Pipedream lets you tap into the details of the technologies used by websites across the internet. With this API, you can find out what tools and frameworks are powering different sites, uncover technology trends, or enrich your CRM with tech stack data. When you combine this with Pipedream's ability to connect to 3,000+ other apps, you can automate workflows that react to this technology intelligence in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Scoring based on Tech Stack**: Enrich leads in a CRM like HubSpot with the technology data from BuiltWith. Score these leads based on the tech they use, which could indicate how qualified they are or how ready they might be for your product.

- **Competitive Analysis Alerts**: Set up a workflow that checks the tech stack of your competitors' websites regularly. When there's a change, like the addition of a new marketing tool or e-commerce platform, send alerts via Slack or email to keep your team informed.

- **Market Research and Reporting**: Use BuiltWith to conduct market research on technology adoption rates. Pull data on the usage of specific technologies and send this data to Google Sheets or Data Studio for reporting and visualization.
