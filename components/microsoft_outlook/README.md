# Overview

The Microsoft Outlook API on Pipedream allows you to automate email-related tasks, manage calendars, and handle contacts effortlessly. With the API, you can trigger workflows on new emails, send emails programmatically, and synchronize calendars across platforms, among other functions. Pipedream's serverless platform facilitates the connection between Outlook and a myriad of other apps for efficient automation workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Email Event to Slack Notification**: When receiving an email from a specific sender or with certain keywords, you can automatically post a message to a Slack channel. This keeps teams informed of important communications without manual monitoring of inboxes.

- **Calendar Sync with Google Calendar**: Upon the creation of a new event in Outlook Calendar, sync this event to Google Calendar. This is ideal for individuals who use multiple calendar services and want to ensure consistency across platforms without manual duplication of events.

- **Automated Email Responses**: Set up a workflow that sends an automated response to emails that meet specific criteria, such as out-of-office replies or acknowledging receipt of customer inquiries. This helps maintain communication with contacts even when you're not actively managing your inbox.
