# Overview

The Airfocus API provides a robust platform for managing product roadmaps, prioritization, and strategic decision-making tools by offering endpoints to manipulate and access items, views, and more. Integrating Airfocus with Pipedream allows you to automate interactions between your roadmap data and other tools like project management software, communication apps, or data analytics platforms. This opens opportunities for synchronizing updates, automating feedback collection, and reporting across different teams and tools efficiently.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Roadmap Updates from Slack Commands**: Use this workflow to let team members update the roadmap directly from Slack. Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for specific commands in Slack (using the Slack app on Pipedream). When a command is detected, the workflow fetches the relevant data from the message (like feature name, status, or priority) and updates the corresponding item in Airfocus via the API.

- **Sync Feature Requests from Jira to Airfocus**: Create a workflow where new Jira issues tagged as "feature request" are automatically added to Airfocus as new items. This workflow listens for new Jira issues using Pipedream's Jira app, filters those requests based on specific tags or fields, and creates corresponding entries in Airfocus, helping product managers quickly incorporate customer and team feedback into the roadmap planning process.

- **Automated Weekly Roadmap Reporting via Email**: Set up a workflow that generates a weekly report of the roadmap progress and sends it via email to all stakeholders. This workflow can use a scheduled trigger in Pipedream to retrieve the latest roadmap information from Airfocus each week. It then formats this data into a readable report and uses an email service like SendGrid (available on Pipedream) to distribute the report, ensuring everyone is informed and aligned on the roadmap status.
