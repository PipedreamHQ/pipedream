# Overview

The Airfocus API allows users to integrate and automate project management tasks, enhancing decision-making processes and strategic planning. With this API, users can manipulate items, lanes, views, and more, directly interacting with the Airfocus platform to streamline workflows and sync data across various business tools. Leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can create powerful automations and connect Airfocus with other apps to optimize project management, team collaboration, and resource allocation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Project Status Updates to Slack**: Automatically send customized notifications to a Slack channel when the status of a project in Airfocus changes. This keeps your team informed in real-time about project progress and critical milestones without manual intervention.

- **Sync Airfocus Priorities with Google Sheets**: Whenever priorities are updated in Airfocus, automatically sync these changes to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This workflow is ideal for maintaining centralized documentation or logs that are accessible and editable by broader teams or stakeholders.

- **Automated Feedback Collection from Typeform to Airfocus**: Capture feedback via Typeform and automatically update or create items in Airfocus based on responses. This can be particularly useful for product teams gathering user feedback and translating it directly into actionable project updates or new initiatives.
