# Overview

The Airfocus API lets you streamline product management processes by integrating with your key systems and automating tasks between them. It can synchronize data, manage product-related workflows, and enhance visibility across different platforms. Using Pipedream, you can tap into these capabilities by creating workflows that trigger actions in other apps whenever certain events occur in Airfocus, or vice versa.

# Example Use Cases

- **Synchronize Roadmap Updates to Slack**: Automatically post updates in a Slack channel when changes are made to a product roadmap in Airfocus. This keeps your team informed and aligned without manual updates.

- **Create Issues in JIRA from Airfocus Feedback**: When feedback is captured in Airfocus, create a corresponding issue in JIRA. This helps in tracking new feature requests or improvements directly from user input.

- **Sync Airfocus Priorities to Google Sheets**: Maintain a real-time Google Sheet that updates whenever priorities are adjusted in Airfocus. This can be used for reporting and analytics, providing a broad view of strategic directions and adjustments.
