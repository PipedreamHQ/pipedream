- **Forex Rate Tracker**  
  Set up a workflow that polls currency exchange rates at regular intervals. Store this data in a Google Sheet for analysis or use Pipedream's built-in data store for historical tracking. Use this data to inform purchasing decisions or trigger alerts when rates are favorable.
