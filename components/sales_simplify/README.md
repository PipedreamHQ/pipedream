# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Qualification Automation**: When a new lead is captured in Sales Simplify, Pipedream triggers a workflow that automatically qualifies the lead based on preset criteria. If qualified, the lead is added to a CRM like Salesforce, and a personalized email sequence is initiated via SendGrid, ensuring prompt and relevant engagement.

- **Sales Activity Digest**: Compile a daily or weekly summary of sales activities and performance metrics from Sales Simplify and send it to a Slack channel. This workflow keeps the sales team informed and aligned, using Pipedream to fetch the data, process it, and deliver insightful reports to the right stakeholders without manual intervention.

- **Customer Support Ticketing**: Integrate Sales Simplify with a ticketing system like Zendesk. Use Pipedream to monitor customer interactions. When a potential issue is detected, such as a negative sentiment in communication, automatically create a support ticket in Zendesk. This ensures swift action and maintains a high standard of customer service.
