# Overview

The Grafbase API allows you to interact with your Grafbase backend, enabling CRUD operations on your data models, managing authentication, and triggering custom business logic. Grafbase provides real-time updates and serverless deployment which makes it a perfect partner for Pipedream's serverless platform. You can build workflows to automate tasks, integrate with various services, and respond to events without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-time Data Sync with Google Sheets**: Use Pipedream to watch for updates in your Grafbase models and reflect those changes into a Google Sheet. This can keep your reporting and analytics up-to-date with the latest data from your applications.

- **Content Moderation Pipeline**: Build a workflow that triggers on new content submissions via Grafbase. Use Pipedream to send the content to a service like AWS Comprehend for sentiment analysis and flag content that doesn't meet community guidelines.

- **Enhanced E-commerce Experience**: Connect Grafbase to a payment platform like Stripe through Pipedream. When a new order is placed, trigger a workflow that creates or updates customer data in Grafbase and handles payment processing with Stripe.
