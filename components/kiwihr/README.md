# Overview

The kiwiHR API enables developers to integrate various HR functionalities into applications or automate tasks related to employee management. With kiwiHR, you can access and manage employee data, leave requests, attendance records, and more. Leveraging this API on Pipedream allows for the creation of dynamic workflows that automate HR processes, sync data across multiple platforms, and trigger actions based on specific conditions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Onboarding Process**: When a new employee is added to kiwiHR, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends a welcome email, schedules onboarding meetings in Google Calendar, and updates a Slack channel with the new hire information to alert team members.

- **Leave Request Management**: Set up a workflow where leave requests submitted via kiwiHR automatically update a shared Google Sheets document, send an approval request to the manager via email, and post the final approval status back to kiwiHR and a specific Slack channel.

- **Attendance Tracking to Payroll Processing**: Automate a connection between kiwiHR attendance records and a payroll app like Gusto. Each time an attendance entry is updated in kiwiHR, the workflow calculates the hours, cross-verifies with the scheduled hours, and updates payroll details in Gusto, ensuring accuracy and timeliness in payroll processing.
