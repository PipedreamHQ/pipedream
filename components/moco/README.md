# Overview

The MOCO API provides programmatic access to functions within the MOCO project management and accounting platform. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to create automated workflows that interact with project data, time entries, invoices, and more. Whether you're syncing project updates to other platforms, automating billing processes, or compiling reports, Pipedream's serverless platform enables you to connect MOCO with various apps and services to streamline your project management and accounting tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Project Time Tracking to Google Sheets**: Sync time tracking entries from MOCO to a Google Sheets spreadsheet for consolidated reporting. Whenever a new time entry is logged in MOCO, a Pipedream workflow triggers and appends the entry details to a designated Google Sheets document. This helps in maintaining up-to-date time tracking records for analysis and client billing.

- **Invoicing Notifications through Slack**: Send notifications to a Slack channel when a new invoice is created in MOCO. Set up a Pipedream workflow that monitors for new invoices in MOCO and then posts a message with the invoice details to Slack, keeping your team instantly informed about billing updates and ensuring prompt follow-up with clients.

- **Sync Projects with Trello for Task Management**: Create Trello cards for new projects added in MOCO. With Pipedream, connect MOCO to Trello and automatically generate corresponding cards when a project is initiated. This allows for a smooth transition from project planning to execution, ensuring that task tracking is in sync across both platforms.
