# Overview

The Weatherbit.io API offers real-time weather data, forecasts, and historical weather information. By integrating this API with Pipedream, you can automate tasks based on weather conditions, set up alerts, or enrich your app with weather data. This can range from triggering workflows when certain weather thresholds are met, to augmenting business data with weather insights, or automating smart home devices in response to the weather.

# Example Use Cases

- **Weather-Triggered Notifications**: Automatically send a message through Slack or email using the Pipedream Slack app or the SMTP service when the Weatherbit.io API reports weather conditions like rain or high temperatures in a specified location. It's handy for event planning or sending reminders to bring an umbrella.

- **Dynamic Advertising Based on Weather**: Adjust advertising campaigns on platforms like Google Ads or Facebook Ads by triggering changes in ad copy or spending when the Weatherbit.io API forecasts specific weather conditions. This could maximize engagement for products that are weather-sensitive, like clothing or travel services.

- **Smart Home Automation**: Integrate with smart home platforms like Philips Hue or Nest using their respective Pipedream apps to adjust lighting or temperature settings based on real-time weather data or forecasts from Weatherbit.io. This creates personalized and energy-efficient home environments.
