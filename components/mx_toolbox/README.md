# Overview

The Mx Toolbox API offers a suite of network diagnostic and lookup tools useful for IT professionals and system administrators. With this API on Pipedream, you can automate checks for domain health, DNS records, blacklisting, and more, integrating these insights into your broader IT infrastructure. Pipedream's serverless platform allows you to create workflows that react to various triggers and pass data between the Mx Toolbox API and numerous other apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Domain Health Monitoring**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow daily to check the health of your domain using Mx Toolbox's domain health API. If issues are detected, the workflow could alert your team via Slack, create a ticket in a service like Jira, or log the incident for further review.

- **Blacklist Status Notification**: Set up a workflow that regularly checks your domain's IP against various blacklists using Mx Toolbox. On detection of a listing, the workflow can notify your security team through Email by integrating with an email service like SendGrid, enabling quick response to potential reputation issues.

- **DNS Change Management**: Monitor for changes in DNS records by scheduling DNS lookups through Mx Toolbox. When a change is identified, the workflow can update a Google Sheet with the new records, send a notification to a Discord channel, or trigger a webhook to inform other systems of the change.
