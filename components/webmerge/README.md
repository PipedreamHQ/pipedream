# Overview

WebMerge is an API that automates the creation of PDFs, Word documents, Excel files, and more, by merging data into custom-built templates. With Pipedream, you can harness this functionality to create dynamic documents fueled by data from various sources. Think auto-generated reports from CRM leads, personalized contracts from form submissions, or automated invoices post-sale. Pipedream's serverless platform allows you to create intricate workflows that connect WebMerge with other apps, triggering document creation with real-time data.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Generation from CRM Deals**: When a deal reaches a certain stage in a CRM like Salesforce, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends deal data to WebMerge, which then generates a tailored contract and emails it directly to the client for signing.

- **Dynamic Report Creation from Analytics Platforms**: Set up a scheduled workflow in Pipedream to pull the latest data from analytics tools like Google Analytics. Use WebMerge to turn that data into a polished, comprehensive report, and then distribute it to stakeholders via a platform like Slack or by emailing through SendGrid.

- **Invoice Processing Post-Purchase**: Capture new payment information from a payment gateway such as Stripe. Trigger a Pipedream workflow to populate an invoice template in WebMerge with the payment details, then save the invoice to a cloud storage service like Dropbox and notify your finance team through a messaging app.
