# Overview

The Northflank API offers a range of functionality for managing and automating deployment workflows, handling various aspects from creating and managing services to scaling and monitoring applications. On Pipedream, you can use this API to create seamless automation that connects your deployment processes with other services and tools, crafting custom continuous deployment pipelines, generating real-time alerts, or automating service scaling based on specific triggers.

# Example Use Cases

- **Continuous Deployment Pipeline**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that listens to GitHub push events. When new code is pushed to your repository, trigger a Northflank API call to build and deploy the latest version of your application. Connect this with Slack to send deployment notifications to a team channel.

- **Automated Backup on Deployment**: Whenever a new deployment is successful via Northflank, use Pipedream to trigger a backup process. The workflow can connect to a cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox, uploading the current state of the database or specific data files, ensuring you have regular backups coinciding with your deployment schedule.

- **Dynamic Resource Scaling**: Leverage metrics from a monitoring service like Datadog to inform your Northflank services about when to scale up or down. Set up a Pipedream workflow that receives CPU or memory usage alerts, and based on predefined thresholds, makes API calls to Northflank to adjust resource allocation accordingly, maintaining optimal application performance.
