# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Generation and Emailing**: When a new order is placed via an e-commerce platform like Shopify, trigger a Pipedream workflow that creates an invoice in FacturaDirecta and then emails it to the customer. This reduces manual data entry and ensures invoices are sent out promptly.

- **Expense Tracking and Reporting**: Use Pipedream to monitor new expenses added to FacturaDirecta, aggregate them weekly, and send a detailed report to your Slack channel. This helps in maintaining real-time visibility of the company's expenditures without manual intervention.

- **Synchronized Customer Management**: When a new contact is added to your CRM, such as Salesforce, a Pipedream workflow can automatically create or update that contact in FacturaDirecta. This ensures consistency across business systems and saves time on contact management.
