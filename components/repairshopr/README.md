# Example Use Cases

- **Automatic Ticket Creation**: Seamlessly create RepairShopr tickets from customer emails or support requests received via integrated apps like Zendesk or Intercom. This workflow could scan incoming messages for specific keywords and, upon detecting a service request, automatically generate a new ticket in RepairShopr, ensuring no customer issue goes unnoticed.

- **Inventory Level Alerting**: Stay ahead of stock shortages by setting up a workflow that monitors inventory levels within RepairShopr. When a critical item's stock falls below a predefined threshold, trigger an alert and create a restock task in project management tools like Asana or Trello, or send a notification to a Slack channel dedicated to inventory management.

- **Invoice Syncing and Payment Tracking**: Connect RepairShopr to accounting software like QuickBooks or Xero. Automate the process of syncing completed invoices from RepairShopr to the accounting system. Additionally, set up alerts for overdue payments and automatically send follow-up reminders to clients via email or SMS through Twilio, reducing the manual effort involved in accounts receivable.
