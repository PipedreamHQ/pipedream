# Overview

The BaseLinker API offers access to a suite of e-commerce management tools, enabling seamless integration of orders, products, and inventory across various online sales channels. With Pipedream's ability to connect APIs, you can automate tasks between BaseLinker and other apps to streamline your e-commerce operations, from syncing inventory to processing orders.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Order Processing**: When a new order comes in via BaseLinker, automatically notify your team on Slack, then generate an invoice in your accounting software like QuickBooks.

- **Multi-channel Inventory Sync**: After a sale is made on one platform, use Pipedream to update stock levels across other platforms like eBay, Amazon, or Shopify to prevent overselling.

- **Customer Follow-Up Sequences**: Trigger an email sequence in Mailchimp or SendGrid when a new order is marked as shipped in BaseLinker, providing customers with tracking info and asking for feedback.
