# Overview

The iContact API provides a programmable way to manage email marketing campaigns, contacts, lists, and messages within iContact's service. Through this API, you can automate the creation and sending of emails, manage subscribers, and track the performance of your campaigns. When used on Pipedream, the iContact API allows you to create serverless workflows that integrate with other apps and services, trigger actions based on various conditions, and automate repetitive tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contact Syncing**: Sync contacts between iContact and a CRM like Salesforce automatically. When a new contact is added to Salesforce, a Pipedream workflow triggers to add that contact to a specified iContact list, ensuring your marketing list is always up-to-date.

- **Email Campaign Trigger Based on User Activity**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to send a personalized email campaign through iContact when a user performs a specific action within your app (e.g., signing up, making a purchase). This can improve engagement by providing timely and relevant email content.

- **Metrics Monitoring and Reporting**: Monitor key performance indicators for your iContact campaigns, such as open rate, click-through rate, and unsubscribes. Use Pipedream to aggregate this data and send a daily or weekly report to a Slack channel, keeping your team informed of campaign performance.
