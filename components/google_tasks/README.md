# Overview

The Google Tasks API allows you to manage and manipulate a user's tasks and task lists on Google Tasks directly from Pipedream. With this API, you can create, read, update, and delete tasks, as well as manage the lists themselves. This opens up possibilities for automating task management, syncing tasks with other systems, and creating custom task-based workflows that can increase productivity and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Task Synchronization Workflow**: Sync tasks between Google Tasks and a project management tool like Trello or Asana. Every time a new task is added in Google Tasks, it triggers a Pipedream workflow that creates a corresponding card or task in the project management app. This keeps all team members aligned regardless of the tools they prefer to use.

- **Email to Task Conversion**: Convert incoming emails from Gmail to tasks in Google Tasks. Use Pipedream to monitor a Gmail inbox for specific criteria, such as emails from a particular sender or emails marked with a specific label. When an email matches the criteria, the workflow creates a new task in Google Tasks with the email content as the task description, making sure you follow up on important messages.

- **Daily Task Digest**: Generate a daily summary of tasks due and send it via a communication platform like Slack or Microsoft Teams. Pipedream can schedule a workflow that fetches tasks due within the next 24 hours from Google Tasks and then formats and sends a message with the list to a designated team channel or direct message, ensuring everyone is aware of their priorities for the day.

# Troubleshooting

## Some Tasks are not triggering events

There is a known issue with the Google Tasks API, that tasks created or assigned from Google Docs are not available via the API. 

This is a limitation with the Google Task APIs. For more information, please visit [Google's Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/244387279).
