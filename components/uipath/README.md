# Overview

UiPath is a leader in Robotic Process Automation (RPA), enabling businesses to automate routine tasks with software robots. Their API provides the ability to manage these robots, processes, and queues programmatically. With UiPath's API on Pipedream, you can create sophisticated automation workflows that trigger actions in UiPath as part of broader, cross-application processes. This could involve initiating UiPath jobs based on incoming data from different sources, managing resources, or reacting to events from other applications or services to create a seamless automation ecosystem.

# Example Use Cases

- **Invoice Processing Automation**: Automatically kick off UiPath processes for new invoices received via email. When a new email attachment is detected by an email service like Gmail, Pipedream can trigger a UiPath job to extract data from the invoice for further processing and entry into an ERP system like SAP.

- **Scheduled Report Generation**: Use Pipedream to schedule and trigger UiPath bots to generate and distribute reports. Connect Pipedream to a time-based trigger to initiate UiPath workflows at specific intervals, pulling data from databases or CRM systems such as Salesforce, processing it, and then emailing the compiled reports to relevant stakeholders.

- **Real-time Slack Notifications for UiPath Job Completion**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream where UiPath sends a web hook to signify the completion of a job. Pipedream can then parse this information and send a notification to a Slack channel, keeping the team updated on the status of robotic processes without manual monitoring.
