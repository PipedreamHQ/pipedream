# Overview

The Remote API on Pipedream allows you to automate tasks related to global payroll, benefits, taxes, and compliance for a remote team. By integrating the Remote API with Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform, you can create workflows that react to events within Remote, or from other sources. Automate employee onboarding, offboarding, and data sync between Remote and your HR systems. Effectively, you can connect Remote to hundreds of other apps to streamline HR processes, gather insights, and maintain up-to-date records across all your platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Employee Onboarding**: When a new hire is added in your HR platform, trigger a Pipedream workflow that creates the employee profile in Remote. This could include setting up payroll details and benefits according to predefined parameters.

- **Sync Employee Updates to a CRM**: Whenever an employee's role or details are updated in Remote, use Pipedream to capture these changes and update their profile in a connected CRM like Salesforce, ensuring sales operations are always informed of the current team structure.

- **Offboarding and Compliance Automation**: When an employee is offboarded in Remote, trigger a Pipedream workflow to revoke their access from all company systems, such as email, internal tools like Slack, and send a task to the legal team to ensure all compliance matters are addressed.
