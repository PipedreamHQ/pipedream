# Overview

Wrike API on Pipedream exposes the robust task and project management features of Wrike, enabling you to automate workflows across various apps and services. With it, you can programmatically access and manipulate tasks, folders, projects, and users within Wrike. This API lends itself to a multitude of automation possibilities, like synchronizing project updates across platforms, streamlining notifications and reporting, or even managing resource allocation based on project workload.

# Example Use Cases

- **Project Status Updates to Slack**: Automatically send project status updates from Wrike to a designated Slack channel. When a Wrike task reaches a certain status, trigger a workflow that posts a message in Slack, keeping your team informed and aligned without manual intervention.

- **Sync Wrike Tasks with Google Calendar**: Create a workflow that adds new Wrike tasks to Google Calendar as events. When a new task is created in Wrike, Pipedream can capture that event, and use the Google Calendar API to schedule it, ensuring your schedule is always up-to-date with your task list.

- **GitHub Issues to Wrike Tasks**: Convert new GitHub issues into Wrike tasks to streamline bug tracking and feature requests. When a new issue is reported on GitHub, trigger a Pipedream workflow that creates a corresponding task in Wrike, tagged and categorized for your dev team to tackle.
