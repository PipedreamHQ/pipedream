# Overview

OneLogin API on Pipedream enables users to automate and manage identity and access management tasks efficiently. It provides the capability to handle user authentications, manage users, roles, and groups, and to secure access to applications with real-time security insights. Integrating OneLogin with Pipedream allows for the creation of automated workflows that reduce manual overhead and enhance security protocols by leveraging real-time triggers and actions across various services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated User Onboarding**: When a new employee is added to an HR system like BambooHR, automatically create a new user account in OneLogin, assign the appropriate roles and permissions, and send a welcome email with login details using SendGrid or a similar email service.

- **Real-time Security Alerts**: Set up a workflow that monitors OneLogin for any unusual login attempts or security breaches. When a suspicious activity is detected, automatically send an alert to a Slack channel and create an incident ticket in a tool like Jira to initiate an immediate response.

- **Sync User Roles Across Platforms**: Ensure user roles and access rights are consistent across multiple platforms by creating a workflow that updates user roles in OneLogin whenever thereâ€™s a change in a connected system like Salesforce or GitHub. This helps in maintaining consistent access controls and compliance across all business applications.
