# Overview

The FileStack API allows for robust file handling and manipulation in the cloud. With this API, you can upload files from any URL or device, transform and convert media files, and deliver content with speed and reliability. When leveraged through Pipedream, the FileStack API becomes a potent tool for automating file workflows, integrating with numerous other services, and handling complex file operations without the need for server infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Image Processing and Optimization**: When images are uploaded to FileStack, use Pipedream to automatically optimize and resize the images for different platforms. The workflow could trigger a notification or update a database with the new image metadata and URLs.

- **Document Conversion and Distribution**: Convert uploaded documents into different formats (e.g., from PDF to DOCX) using FileStack, then use Pipedream to distribute the converted files via email using an app like SendGrid, or save them to cloud storage solutions like Dropbox or Google Drive.

- **Content Moderation Pipeline**: Build a content moderation system that scans uploaded files for inappropriate content using FileStack's AI-powered content safety API. With Pipedream, if content is flagged, automatically notify moderators and log details to a service like Airtable or Google Sheets.
