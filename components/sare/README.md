# Overview

The SARE API provides robust tools for email marketing and automation, enabling users to manage subscribers, send emails, and analyze campaigns directly via API. By leveraging SARE's features on Pipedream, you can automate workflows involving email operations, integrate with other platforms for enhanced data handling and customer engagement, and streamline communications in various marketing campaigns. This integration can particularly benefit marketers looking to automate responses based on subscriber behavior or integrate email marketing metrics with other business tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Welcome Email Sequence**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream when a new user signs up via your app, using the Shopify or WordPress trigger. The workflow would then use the SARE API to add the subscriber to a specific mailing list and send a series of pre-defined welcome emails over several days, enhancing user engagement right from the start.

- **User Feedback Collection Campaign**: After a customer purchases a product, use a Pipedream workflow triggered by a Stripe or PayPal purchase event. This workflow could utilize the SARE API to send a personalized email requesting product feedback or a review, thereby increasing direct interaction and gathering valuable customer insights.

- **Re-engagement Campaigns for Dormant Users**: Set up a workflow triggered by a custom cron job that checks for users who haven't interacted with your service for a set period, perhaps 6 months. Using the SARE API through Pipedream, you can automatically send re-engagement emails offering special promotions or updates about new features, aiming to reactivate these dormant users.
