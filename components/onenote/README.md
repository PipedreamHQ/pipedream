# Overview

The Microsoft OneNote API lets you create, read, and update notes and notebooks. Integrating this API with Pipedream opens doors to automate note-taking, content management, and data syncing tasks. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can set up workflows that trigger actions in OneNote or respond to events in OneNote, streamlining your digital note organization and enhancing productivity with automated processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Meeting Minutes**: Sync meeting notes to a OneNote notebook after a calendar event. After a Google Calendar event ends, a Pipedream workflow extracts the minutes from a document and creates a new note in a specified OneNote section.

- **Task Management Sync**: Create OneNote tasks from new Trello cards. Whenever a new card is added to a Trello board, a Pipedream workflow triggers, adding a corresponding task in OneNote, ensuring tasks are noted across platforms.

- **Content Backup**: Back up new OneNote pages to Dropbox. Each time a new page is added to a OneNote section, Pipedream detects the change and automatically saves a copy of the page to a designated Dropbox folder, providing an extra layer of redundancy.
