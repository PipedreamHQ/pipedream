# Overview

Corsizio is a platform for event registration, payment processing, and attendee management. With the Corsizio API, you can automate your event management workflows on Pipedream, such as synchronizing attendee data with a CRM, sending custom emails based on event registration status, or processing payments and refunding attendees. By utilizing Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create intricate automations that respond to various Corsizio events, handle data transformation, and interact with countless other APIs for a seamless integration experience.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Attendee Follow-up**: After an attendee registers for an event on Corsizio, trigger a Pipedream workflow to send a personalized welcome email via SendGrid. If the attendee doesn't complete payment within a certain timeframe, follow up with a reminder email or SMS via Twilio.

- **CRM Synchronization**: Keep your CRM up-to-date by creating a Pipedream workflow that triggers whenever a new registration occurs on Corsizio. Use this trigger to add or update the attendee's information in Salesforce, ensuring your sales team has the latest data without manual entry.

- **Feedback Collection Post-Event**: After an event concludes, automate the process of gathering feedback. Use a Pipedream workflow to send a survey link from Typeform to all attendees. Collect responses and aggregate the data in Google Sheets for easy analysis and future event improvement.
