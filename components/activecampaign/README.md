# ActiveCampaign

With ActiveCampaign's API, you can build a variety of integrations and
applications to help streamline your business. Here are just a few examples:

- A contact importer that pulls in your contacts from another CRM or email
  service
- A webhook that automatically updates your ActiveCampaign lists when someone
  subscribes or unsubscribes from your website
- An integration that allows you to send SMS messages through ActiveCampaign
- A geolocation tool that tracks where your contacts are located
- And much more!
