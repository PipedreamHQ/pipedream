# Overview

The 10to8 API lets you interact with your 10to8 appointment scheduling data programmatically. Use it within Pipedream to automate booking workflows, sync appointment data with other apps, send custom notifications, and more. By tapping into 10to8's API, you can create, update, and cancel bookings, retrieve customer details, and sync your calendar events, helping you streamline the scheduling process and integrate it with your digital ecosystem.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Appointment Confirmations**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream when a new appointment is booked on 10to8. Automatically send a custom confirmation email via SendGrid or a personalized SMS through Twilio to the customer, including details of the appointment.

- **Sync Appointments with Google Calendar**: Upon booking a new appointment in 10to8, use a Pipedream workflow to sync this appointment to a Google Calendar. This ensures your schedule is always up-to-date across platforms and you avoid double bookings.

- **Aggregate Customer Feedback**: After an appointment is completed, trigger a workflow to send a feedback form using Typeform. Collect responses and save them to a Google Sheets document for easy analysis and follow-up.
