# Overview

The ScrapingBot API empowers developers to harvest data from web pages without the hassle of managing complex scraping rules. With this API on Pipedream, you can automate the retrieval of HTML content, prices, or real estate data from web pages and tie this into a variety of workflows. Whether you're tracking price changes, aggregating content, or monitoring real estate listings, integrating ScrapingBot with Pipedream's serverless platform enables seamless data collection and interaction with other services.

## Example Use Cases

- **Price Monitoring for E-commerce**
  Automate the tracking of product prices across different online retailers by using the ScrapingBot API to scrape price data at regular intervals. Combine the scraped data with Pipedream's built-in data store to analyze trends and trigger alerts or actions, such as adjusting your own pricing or notifying your team via Slack when a competitor's price drops.

- **Content Aggregation for News Outlets**
  Build a workflow that uses ScrapingBot to fetch the latest articles and news from a variety of sources. Process, curate, and amalgamate the content within Pipedream. Then, using the SendGrid app, dispatch a daily digest email to subscribers summarizing new content, keeping them informed with minimal effort.

- **Real Estate Listing Alerts**
  Utilize ScrapingBot to monitor real estate websites for new listings. Set up a Pipedream workflow that analyzes the data for specific criteria such as location, price, or property features. When a match is found, use Twilio to send a text message to interested buyers or agents, giving them the edge in a competitive market.
