# Overview

Paystack is a payment gateway that allows businesses to accept payments online from customers. With the Paystack API, you can automate invoicing, verify transactions, manage customers, and more. On Pipedream, you can integrate Paystack with a multitude of other apps to build powerful workflows, such as syncing payment data with accounting software, triggering events based on transaction status, or automating customer outreach.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Generation and Payment Tracking**: When a customer completes an order on your e-commerce platform, use Pipedream to automatically generate an invoice via the Paystack API and send it to the customer. Once payment is confirmed, update the order status in your database and notify the customer with a thank-you message.

- **Subscription Payment Verification and Access Control**: Integrate Paystack with a membership platform to handle subscription payments. Use Pipedream to check for successful subscription payments and, upon verification, grant or extend access to premium content. Conversely, automate access revocation for failed renewals.

- **Real-time Financial Dashboard Updates**: Connect Paystack to a dashboard app like Geckoboard on Pipedream. Set up a workflow that listens for new transactions on Paystack, processes the data, and then pushes real-time updates to your financial dashboard, allowing for immediate insight into sales trends and revenue.
