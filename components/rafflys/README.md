# Overview

Rafflys API provides tools to create and manage online raffles and contests, paving the way for engagement and promotional activities. Within Pipedream, you can leverage this API to build automations that enhance the way you run contests, connect with your audience, and analyze engagement data. By integrating Rafflys with other apps on Pipedream, you can craft workflows that streamline contest operations, notify winners, or even sync data with marketing platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contest Creation and Notification**: Create a periodic workflow in Pipedream that automatically sets up new raffles in Rafflys at scheduled intervals. Use the Slack or Discord app to announce the new contest to your community instantly.

- **Dynamically Sync Contest Entries with Google Sheets**: Each time a new entry is submitted to a Rafflys contest, trigger a workflow that adds the entrant's details to a Google Sheet. This facilitates real-time tracking and analysis of participant data.

- **Winner Announcement Workflow**: After a Rafflys contest concludes, use a workflow to pick a winner and post the results to your social media platforms, such as Twitter or Facebook, to increase transparency and engagement.
