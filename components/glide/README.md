# Overview

The Glide API allows you to create feature-rich, mobile-friendly apps directly from data sources like Google Sheets or Excel. On Pipedream, you can harness this seamless bridge between your data and the app interface to automate tasks, sync data in real time, and dynamically control your Glide apps. Combine Glide with other apps on Pipedream to enhance functionality, like triggering notifications, processing payments, or managing user data.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Google Sheets with Glide**: Automate the updating of a Glide appâ€™s data by watching for changes in a connected Google Sheets document. When a row is added or modified, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that updates the app data, ensuring your Glide app is always current without manual intervention.

- **Process Payments with Stripe**: Create a workflow that integrates Glide with Stripe. When a user makes a purchase within your Glide app, trigger an event that Pipedream captures, creating a new payment intent in Stripe. Pipedream can then confirm the payment and update the app, providing a smooth transaction experience.

- **Manage Users with SendGrid**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to manage user onboarding. When a new user signs up in your Glide app, use Pipedream to send their details to SendGrid, triggering a welcome email sequence. This keeps your users engaged and informed from the moment they start using your app.
