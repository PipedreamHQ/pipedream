# Overview

The Airplane API facilitates the creation and management of tasks and runs within the Airplane toolkit, which is geared towards automating developer operations and internal tools. In Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate workflows, integrate with various services, and handle background tasks. By connecting Airplane to other apps on Pipedream, you can streamline processes like deploying code, managing feature flags, or orchestrating complex workflows that interact with other APIs and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Scheduled Deployment Trigger**: Automatically trigger a deployment task in Airplane using Pipedream's scheduled events. This can be set up to deploy nightly builds or after certain conditions are met in your code repository.

- **Slack Command to Run Airplane Tasks**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that starts an Airplane task using a Slash command in Slack. This allows for quick, chat-based interactions to execute operations without leaving the conversation.

- **Error Logging to Airplane from Another Service**: Capture errors from an application monitored by, say, Sentry, and log them to Airplane via Pipedream. This could then trigger a task in Airplane to handle the error or notify the appropriate team.
