# Overview

The DocuSign API enables you to integrate electronic signature workflows into your applications, automate the process of sending and receiving documents for signatures, and securely manage related data. Leveraging Pipedream's platform, you can build powerful automations that streamline how contracts and agreements are handled, enhance compliance, and improve overall efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Workflow**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow when a new contract is added to a cloud storage platform like Dropbox. Automatically send the document for signature via DocuSign, and once signed, save the final version back to Dropbox and notify relevant parties through email or a Slack message.

- **CRM Integration for Sales**: Upon closing a deal in a CRM system like Salesforce, a Pipedream workflow can be initiated to send the sales agreement through DocuSign for signature. After the document is fully signed, update the Salesforce record with the status of the agreement and attach the signed document for easy access.

- **Onboarding Process Automation**: For HR teams, initiate a Pipedream workflow when a new employee is added to an HR management system like BambooHR. Send all necessary onboarding documents through DocuSign for e-signature. Once completed, store the signed documents in a secure HR folder and update the employee's records with their signed contracts.
