# Overview

The Docusign API allows developers to integrate Docusign's electronic signature
capabilities into their own applications. With the API, developers can create,
send, and manage documents that require electronic signatures. Additionally,
the API can be used to track the status of document signing processes, as well
as manage account settings and users.
