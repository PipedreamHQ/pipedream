# Overview

The Temi API gives developers the ability to create revolutionary new
applications that can interact with Temi, the world's first personal robot for
the home that treats each household member with respect and kindness. With this
powerful API, you can add voice commands, facial recognition, even autonomous
navigation to your app, making it truly powerful and revolutionary!

The possibilities are endless with the Temi API. Here's some of the things you
can build:

- Autonomous Navigation: Create an app that enables Temi to intuitively search
  and reach its configured destinations.
- Voice Commands: Enable your app to respond to voice commands issued by Temi's
  users.
- Facial Recognition: Implement facial recognition in your app and get Temi to
  recognize and greet house members on arrival.
- Content Distribution: Create an app that allows users to store and access
  media and other content on Temi.
- Robotics Apps: Create innovative robotic apps to let users interact with Temi
  in more ways.
- Home Automation: Create an app that lets Temi control home devices like
  lights and heaters, or monitor smoke and CO2 levels.
