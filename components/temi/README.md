# Overview

Temi API offers automated transcription services, converting audio and video files into text. With Pipedream's robust platform, you can exploit Temi's capabilities to activate a myriad of automated workflows, from transcribing meeting recordings for easy reference to triggering tasks based on the presence of keywords in transcribed text. The real power lies in connecting these transcriptions to other services for further analysis, archiving, or even real-time alerting.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Meeting Minutes**: Kick off a workflow when a new recording is uploaded to Google Drive, automatically sending the file to Temi for transcription. Then, format the resulting text and post it to a Slack channel or an internal wiki, ensuring team members have immediate access to meeting outcomes.

- **Content Creation & SEO**: Send podcast or webinar recordings to Temi for transcription, then use Pipedream's integration with WordPress (or any other CMS) to publish the content. This can enhance SEO by providing text versions of your audio content, making it searchable and increasing web traffic.

- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: After a support call ends, use Temi to transcribe the conversation; then analyze it with sentiment analysis tools like IBM Watson via Pipedream workflows. Push results into CRMs like Salesforce to track customer satisfaction trends or alert management about critical feedback.
