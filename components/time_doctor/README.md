# Overview

The Time Doctor API lets you tap into detailed data on how you or your team spend work hours. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can automate actions based on this data, like logging work hours, analyzing productivity, or integrating with other business tools to streamline workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Time Tracking Sync**: Automate the syncing of time tracking data from Time Doctor to your project management tool. Each time an entry is created or updated in Time Doctor, a Pipedream workflow can trigger to update tasks in your project management app, keeping all records aligned.

- **Productivity Reports to Slack**: Generate daily or weekly productivity reports and send them to a dedicated Slack channel. Set up a Pipedream workflow that aggregates Time Doctor data, compiles a report, and posts it to Slack, so the team stays informed on productivity trends.

- **Alerts for Unusual Activity**: Create alerts for when employees log more or fewer hours than a threshold. Use Pipedream to monitor Time Doctor entries, detect anomalies, and send notifications via email or SMS, helping to maintain consistent work patterns or identify burnout risks.
