# Overview

The TaxJar API offers a suite of tools for automating sales tax calculations, reporting, and filings. With this API, you can get real-time sales tax rates and calculations at checkout, generate detailed sales tax reports for each state, and automate your sales tax filings. Integrating TaxJar with Pipedream allows you to create workflows that can enhance e-commerce platforms, financial systems, and accounting software, ensuring that sales tax handling is both accurate and effortless.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time Sales Tax Calculation at Checkout**  
  Automatically calculate sales tax in Pipedream workflows for e-commerce orders. When a new order is received in Shopify, trigger a workflow that uses the TaxJar API to calculate the appropriate sales tax based on the customerâ€™s location and the items purchased.

- **Monthly Sales Tax Reporting**  
  Schedule a Pipedream workflow that runs at the end of every month, summarizing total sales and taxes collected through Stripe. Use TaxJar to prepare the tax reports needed for filing, ensuring compliance with minimal manual effort.

- **Automated Tax Filing Reminders**  
  Combine the TaxJar API with Google Calendar in Pipedream to create workflows that remind you to file taxes before the due date. When TaxJar reports a nearing filing deadline, the workflow can create an event in your Google Calendar as a reminder.
