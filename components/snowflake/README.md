The Snowflake API offers many tools to help developers create robust, secure,
and scalable data warehouses. It provides a platform to create data models and
perform analytics on your data. It also offers integration with other data
sources and services, giving you the ability to create powerful data warehouses
with the power to scale.

Below is a list of examples of the things that can be built using the Snowflake
API:
