# Overview

The Baremetrics API offers granular data on your SaaS metrics, including MRR, ARR, LTV, and churn rates, directly accessible for analytics, reporting, and enhancing business intelligence. With Pipedream's integration capabilities, you can automate workflows that react to this data in real-time, syncing with other services for actions like customer engagement, financial forecasting, and trigger-based alerting.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Milestone Engagement**: Set up a workflow that listens for updates to customer lifetime value (LTV) via the Baremetrics API. When a customer's LTV hits a predefined milestone, trigger an automated congratulatory email or special offer via SendGrid or another email service, bolstering customer relations and encouraging brand loyalty.

- **Churn Alerting and Follow-Up**: Monitor churn events with the Baremetrics API on Pipedream. When a churn is detected, automatically send the event to a Slack channel to alert the team. Following that, trigger a feedback survey from Typeform to the churned customer to understand their reasons for leaving and gather data for service improvement.

- **Real-Time Reporting Dashboard**: Build a workflow where Pipedream pulls the latest SaaS metrics from Baremetrics and pushes them to a Google Sheet or a data visualization tool like Google Data Studio. Automate daily or weekly updates to maintain a real-time dashboard for stakeholders to make more informed decisions based on the most current business performance indicators.
