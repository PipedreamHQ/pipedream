# Overview

The Rejoiner API is designed to help e-commerce businesses automate their email marketing campaigns, specifically focusing on cart abandonment, win-back campaigns, and personalized product recommendations. By leveraging this API on Pipedream, users can create targeted, event-driven workflows that engage customers based on their behaviors and actions on your site, helping to increase conversions and retain customers.

# Example Use Cases

- **Cart Abandonment Email Trigger**:
  Use the Rejoiner API to monitor cart status. When a cart is abandoned, trigger an email via Rejoiner directly from Pipedream. Enhance this by integrating with Shopify to pull in recent user activity and cart contents, ensuring the email content is personalized and relevant.

- **Win-Back Campaign Activation**:
  Set up a workflow where customer data from a platform like Salesforce is used to identify customers who haven't made a purchase within a specific timeframe. Use this data to trigger a Rejoiner-driven email campaign aimed at winning back these customers, possibly offering them a special discount or update on new products.

- **Product Recommendation Engine**:
  Combine Rejoiner with user behavior data from your website (captured via Google Analytics) to craft and send personalized product recommendations. When a user views certain products but does not make a purchase, trigger a follow-up email via Rejoiner suggesting similar items or offering a limited-time discount.
