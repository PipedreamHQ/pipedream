# Overview

The Azure API for FHIR enables developers to work with protected health data in real-time across the healthcare ecosystem using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards. With this API on Pipedream, you can automate data exchange processes, enhance healthcare app functionalities, and connect disparate systems in healthcare settings. This leads to more integrated health data management and streamlined workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Patient Data Sync**: Automatically synchronize patient records across various healthcare platforms in real-time. When a new patient record is created or updated in the Azure API for FHIR, trigger a workflow on Pipedream to update the same record in other CRM systems like Salesforce or electronic health records (EHR) systems.

- **Real-time Health Event Notifications**: Set up notifications for specific health events such as hospital admissions or lab results. When such events are recorded on the Azure FHIR API, use Pipedream to trigger SMS via Twilio or send emails to relevant healthcare providers or patients, ensuring immediate communication.

- **Data Analysis and Reporting**: Automatically extract data from the Azure API for FHIR to create comprehensive reports or feed data analytics tools. For instance, you can trigger a workflow that pulls daily patient data, processes it through a data analytics tool like Google BigQuery, and generates visual reports using Google Data Studio or sends them via email for review.
