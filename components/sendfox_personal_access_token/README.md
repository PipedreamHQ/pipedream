# Overview

Sendfox is an email marketing tool designed for content creators. You can automate your email marketing operations by programmatically managing contacts, campaigns, and lists. Pipedream leverages this by allowing you to connect Sendfox with numerous other apps, providing a seamless integration platform to streamline your email marketing workflows. Automate the process of gathering leads from various platforms, syncing your subscriber lists, or triggering personalized email sequences based on specific actions or events.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Capture Automation**: Integrate Sendfox with Typeform via Pipedream to automatically add new form respondents to your Sendfox contact list. When someone completes a Typeform survey or a subscription form, Pipedream triggers an automation that captures the respondent's details and directly subscribes them to your Sendfox list, ensuring you're always building your audience with the latest leads.

- **Content-Based Email Sequences**: Connect Sendfox with your CMS, like WordPress. Whenever you publish a new blog post, Pipedream triggers an email campaign in Sendfox to notify your subscribers about the fresh content. This keeps your audience engaged and returning to your site, boosting both traffic and loyalty.

- **E-commerce Customer Follow-Up**: Pair Sendfox with Shopify on Pipedream to create a targeted post-purchase follow-up sequence. After a customer makes a purchase, trigger a workflow that enrolls them into a Sendfox automation series designed to provide additional value, ask for feedback, or promote repeat business. This enhances customer experience and encourages brand loyalty.
