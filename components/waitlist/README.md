# Overview

The Waitlist API allows developers to manage and interact with user waitlists effectively. With this API, you can add or remove users, send notifications, and gather data on user engagement and demographics. This makes it an excellent tool for managing launches of new products or features, controlling access to beta versions of software, or organizing limited availability events.

# Example Use Case

- **Launch a New Product**: Automate the process of managing a waitlist for a new product launch. As users sign up, use the Waitlist API to add them to the waitlist, send confirmation emails, and notify them when the product is available.

- **Beta Testing Software**: For software in beta testing, use the Waitlist API to manage access. Automatically add testers as they sign up, track their feedback, and integrate with bug tracking apps to streamline development.

- **Event Ticketing**: Manage limited ticket events by using the Waitlist API to handle sign-ups. Automatically notify users when tickets become available and integrate with payment platforms to process purchases.
