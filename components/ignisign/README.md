# Overview

The IgniSign API facilitates automated digital signature processes, allowing you to create, manage, and track e-signature requests directly through the API. This capability is particularly useful in environments where contracts, agreements, and legal documents need to be handled electronically, streamlining operations and reducing manual errors. By integrating IgniSign with Pipedream, users can automate workflows involving various other apps and services, enhancing business processes like sales, HR onboarding, legal compliance, and customer service.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Contract Signing for New Hires**: When a new employee is added in an HR system like BambooHR, a Pipedream workflow is triggered, automatically creating a signature request for employment contracts via the IgniSign API. Once signed, the document is stored securely in a service like Google Drive and the HR system is updated.

- **Real Estate Closing Document Handling**: Automatically send out closing documents for signature when a new property sale is recorded in a CRM like Salesforce. Upon receiving the signed documents via IgniSign, update the CRM status and notify the real estate agent and buyer via email or SMS through integration with services like Twilio or SendGrid.

- **Streamline Legal Compliance Processes**: For new regulations requiring updated NDAs or compliance documents, set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers based on calendar dates or specific events. It sends out requests for digital signatures via IgniSign to all required parties and, once completed, archives them in a compliance folder in Dropbox or Box, and logs the activity in a compliance tracking system.
