# Overview

IgniSign API allows users to manage and automate digital signature processes efficiently. Leveraging this API on Pipedream, you can create, send, and manage signature requests without manual intervention, integrating seamlessly with other tools and services to enhance productivity and streamline document handling.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Generation and Signing with Google Docs**: Automatically generate contracts using Google Docs based on inputs from a CRM like Salesforce. Once generated, the IgniSign API sends these documents for signing. After signing, the signed contract is saved back to Google Drive and the CRM record is updated, ensuring all systems are synchronized.

- **Client Onboarding Workflow Automation**: Streamline client onboarding by automatically sending welcome and policy documents for signatures when a new client record is added to a CRM platform. Once signed, these documents are stored in a secure cloud storage service like Dropbox, and the client's status is updated in the CRM to reflect completion of the onboarding process.

- **HR Employee Onboarding Automation**: For new hires, automatically send employment agreements and policy documents for signature when a new employee record is added to an HR management system. After the documents are signed, they are uploaded to a secure HR portal, and tasks for equipment setup and orientation are automatically created in a project management tool like Asana.
