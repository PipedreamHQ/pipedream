# Overview

The Fillout API provides robust tools for creating, managing, and analyzing custom forms and surveys. With Fillout, businesses can streamline the process of data collection and insights gathering directly from their users or customers. Using Pipedream's capabilities, you can integrate Fillout with hundreds of other services, enabling automated workflows that can trigger actions in other apps based on responses, synchronize data across platforms, or generate real-time notifications and reports.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Feedback to Slack Notification**: Automatically send a summary of each new Fillout survey response to a Slack channel. This workflow can keep a team instantly informed about customer feedback, improving response times and engagement.

- **Survey Response Data to Google Sheets**: Store new Fillout responses in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This is ideal for data analysis and sharing within teams who use Google Workspace. It allows for easy access and manipulation of data for insights and reporting.

- **Automated Email Follow-ups**: Trigger an email sequence from a service like SendGrid or Mailgun when a form is completed. This can be used for lead nurturing by sending thank you emails, additional information, or promotional content based on the user's responses.
