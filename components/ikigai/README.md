# Overview

The Ikigai API offers a suite of tools focused on simplifying and enhancing financial services. Through Pipedream, developers can connect the Ikigai API with numerous other apps to create custom, automated workflows. These workflows can handle tasks such as managing investments, analyzing financial markets, and monitoring personal finance health. 

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Investment Alerts**: Trigger a notification workflow when a new investment opportunity arises that meets specific criteria. For instance, a Pipedream workflow could monitor Ikigai for high-performing assets and send alerts via email or messaging apps like Slack whenever such an opportunity is detected.

- **Real-time Portfolio Analysis**: Sync investment data from Ikigai to Google Sheets using Pipedream. This workflow could continuously update a Google Sheet with the latest portfolio performance data, allowing for real-time analysis and visualization of financial trends.

- **Personal Finance Health Checks**: Schedule a regular Pipedream workflow to retrieve your financial health score from Ikigai and compare it against predefined goals. If certain thresholds are met or crossed, the workflow could then perform actions like sending a congratulatory message, creating a task in a project management app like Trello, or logging the event in a database for long-term tracking.
