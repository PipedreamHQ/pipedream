# Overview

Keen API empowers developers to capture, analyze, and embed event data into their applications, creating opportunities for deep analytics and custom visualization capabilities. With Keen, you can stream, store, and query large volumes of events, enabling real-time insights into user behavior, system performance, or any other metric that can be captured via events. On Pipedream, integrating Keen allows you to automate workflows by capturing these events and triggering actions in other apps, based on the data you gather.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time Alerting System**: Connect Keen to communication platforms like Slack or Twilio on Pipedream. Monitor your application's performance metrics in Keen, and set up a workflow that sends immediate notifications to your team's Slack channel or sends SMS alerts when performance anomalies are detected.

- **Dynamic User Segmentation**: Integrate Keen with a CRM like Salesforce using Pipedream. Analyze user activities and behaviors through Keen, and automatically segment users in your CRM based on their event patterns. For example, identifying highly engaged users and flagging them in Salesforce for targeted marketing campaigns.

- **Customer Success Tracking**: Use Keen with Pipedream to funnel event data into a tool like Google Sheets or Airtable. Track customer milestones or feature usage, and create a system that updates a spreadsheet or database in real time. This can help customer success teams to proactively address user needs and improve retention.
