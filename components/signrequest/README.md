# Overview

With the SignRequest API on Pipedream, you can automate sending documents for signatures, monitor the status of sent documents, and streamline the e-signature process within your own applications or workflows. This facilitates swift and secure digital signatures, allowing you to integrate SignRequest with other services for enhanced document management and notification systems.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Document Workflow for HR Onboarding**: Use SignRequest to send employment contracts as part of an automated HR onboarding process. When a new employee is added to your HR system, Pipedream can trigger a workflow to send the necessary documents for signature via SignRequest, then update your HR system once the documents are signed.

- **Contract Management with Google Drive**: Set up a workflow where new contracts added to a specific Google Drive folder are automatically sent out for signatures. Pipedream can monitor the folder for new files, send them through SignRequest, and then move signed contracts to a 'Completed' folder within Google Drive.

- **Sales Pipeline Signature Tracking**: Integrate SignRequest with a CRM like Salesforce. Whenever a sales deal reaches a certain stage in the pipeline, Pipedream can trigger a SignRequest to send out the sales agreement for signature, then update the CRM record with the signature status, keeping the sales process moving smoothly.
