# Overview

DataRobot offers an AI platform that empowers users to build and deploy predictive models. Through its API, you can manage datasets, kick off model training, retrieve predictive scores, and integrate machine learning insights into your business processes. With Pipedream, you can create serverless workflows that leverage DataRobot's capabilities, enabling a powerful synergy between machine learning and everyday business automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Lead Scoring**: Integrate DataRobot with a CRM like Salesforce in Pipedream. As new leads come in, trigger a workflow that sends the lead data to DataRobot, runs a prediction to score the lead's likelihood to convert, and then updates the lead score in Salesforce. This ensures that sales teams focus on the most promising leads.

- **Real-time Fraud Detection**: Link DataRobot with transactional systems such as Stripe. When a new transaction occurs, a Pipedream workflow can invoke DataRobot to analyze the transaction for potential fraud. If a high probability of fraud is detected, the workflow can automatically flag the transaction and alert your risk management team.

- **Dynamic Pricing Adjustments**: Combine DataRobot with an eCommerce platform like Shopify. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers whenever a new order is placed. The workflow sends the order data to DataRobot to predict demand and suggests price adjustments. This can help optimize revenue by dynamically pricing products based on changing market conditions.
