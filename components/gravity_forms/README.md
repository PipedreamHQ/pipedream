# Overview

The Gravity Forms API allows you to interact programmatically with Gravity Forms, a WordPress form plugin, to create, update, delete, and retrieve form entries. Within Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate workflows, integrate with other apps, and manipulate form data in real-time. By connecting Gravity Forms to Pipedream's serverless platform, you open up possibilities to sync form submissions with databases, trigger notifications, or even process payments automatically.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Form Submissions with Google Sheets**: When a new form submission is received, use the Gravity Forms API to capture the data and append it to a Google Sheet. This can be useful for tracking submissions or analyzing data without manual entry.

- **Send Custom Email Notifications**: After a form submission, employ the Gravity Forms API to trigger a custom email notification. You can include details from the submission in the email, and conditionally send different emails based on form data. This enhances communication and allows for immediate follow-up actions.

- **Integrate with a CRM**: Automatically create or update contacts in a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot when a new form entry is submitted. This workflow can help maintain an up-to-date customer database, improve lead tracking, and streamline sales processes.
