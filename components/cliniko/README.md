# Overview

The Cliniko API opens a gateway to healthcare practice management by allowing you to interact with patient data, appointments, treatments, and more. With Pipedream, you can automate mundane tasks, ensuring that patient care remains front and center. Think of syncing appointment data with other calendars, sending personalized follow-up emails, or even managing inventory based on treatment records, all streamlined on a serverless platform.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Patient Follow-up**: After an appointment is completed in Cliniko, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends a follow-up email through SendGrid, thanking the patient and providing care instructions or a feedback survey link.

- **Appointment Syncing with Google Calendar**: Use Pipedream to watch for new or updated appointments in Cliniko and automatically mirror these changes in a specified Google Calendar, ensuring seamless scheduling visibility across different platforms.

- **Inventory Management Post-Treatment**: Configure a Pipedream workflow to update inventory levels in a tool like Airtable or Google Sheets when a treatment is recorded in Cliniko, which helps in maintaining adequate stock levels for medical supplies.
