# Overview

The PaperForm API offers a robust means to interact programmatically with PaperForm's features, allowing you to automate form submissions, retrieve form data, and integrate with various other services. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can construct workflows that respond to events from PaperForm forms—like new submissions—by triggering actions in other apps, or perform operations on the submissions themselves.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Lead Capture and CRM Integration**: When a potential customer submits a form on PaperForm, trigger a workflow that captures the submission data and feeds it directly into a CRM such as Salesforce or HubSpot. This can help ensure immediate follow-up and maintain an organized lead pipeline.

- **Feedback Collection and Analysis Workflow**: After receiving a new submission from a feedback form, use Pipedream to parse the data, send it to a Google Sheet for aggregation, and then use sentiment analysis tools to gauge customer satisfaction. You could even trigger an automated email response thanking them for their input.

- **Event Registration and Calendar Synchronization**: For new event registrations via PaperForm, trigger a Pipedream workflow that creates an event in a Google Calendar, sends a personalized confirmation email with event details to the registrant, and posts a message in a Slack channel to notify the team.
