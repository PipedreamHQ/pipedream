# Overview

The Slottable API provides a way to manage scheduling by creating, updating, and deleting slots related to appointments, classes, or any event that requires booking. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can automate workflows that trigger based on actions within Slottable or external events, and then interact with the Slottable API to manage your scheduling data. This might include syncing booking information with a calendar, sending reminders or follow-up emails, or aggregating data for analytics.

# Example Use Cases

- **Calendar Sync**: Automatically sync new or updated slots from Slottable to a Google Calendar, ensuring your schedule is always up-to-date across platforms.

- **Appointment Reminder System**: Send an SMS reminder, via Twilio, to clients a day before their scheduled slot to reduce no-shows.

- **Analytics Reporting**: Collect slot booking data over time and send it to a Google Sheets spreadsheet for analysis and reporting on booking trends.
