# Overview

The Okta API provides extensive capabilities for identity management, enabling developers to automate user registrations, profile updates, and access control operations. Leveraging the Okta API on Pipedream allows you to integrate these identity management features with hundreds of other apps seamlessly. With Pipedream, you can create automated workflows that trigger from Okta events, such as user login or group changes, and perform actions in other services, making it a powerful tool for enhancing security, streamlining user management, and ensuring compliance across your tech stack.

# Example Use Cases

- **User Onboarding Automation**: When a new employee is added to Okta, automatically create accounts for them in services like Slack, Microsoft Office 365, and Trello. Send a personalized welcome email via SendGrid or Gmail, and post a welcome message in a designated Slack channel.

- **Security Compliance Monitoring**: Monitor Okta for any changes to user roles or permissions and automatically log these events in a Google Sheets spreadsheet for audit purposes. Send real-time alerts via Slack or email if suspicious activities, such as multiple failed login attempts, are detected.

- **Streamlined Access Revocation**: When an employee leaves the company and their user status in Okta is deactivated, trigger workflows to revoke access from all connected applications like AWS, GitHub, and Dropbox. Additionally, archive their emails and documents to a designated Google Drive folder for compliance.
