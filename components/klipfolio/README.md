# Overview

The Klipfolio API opens a window to managing and automating your Klipfolio dashboards and data sources directly from Pipedream. With this API, you can programmatically create, update, and delete dashboards, Klips (widgets), and data sources. This allows you to integrate Klipfolio with a multitude of other services, triggering updates to your dashboards as data changes in other apps, or even automate the import and transformation of data for your Klipfolio visualizations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Dashboard Reporting**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream that fetches data from various sources like Google Analytics and Salesforce, processes it, and then updates a Klipfolio dashboard. This can be scheduled daily or triggered by certain events, ensuring your dashboard always shows the latest metrics.

- **Dynamic Data Source Refresh**: Use Pipedream to monitor a database or a webhook for changes. Once a change is detected, the workflow can update the corresponding data source in Klipfolio, ensuring your visualizations reflect real-time data without manual intervention.

- **Alerts for Metrics Anomalies**: Create a Pipedream workflow that analyzes the data in your Klipfolio data sources at regular intervals. If it detects anomalies or values crossing certain thresholds, it can send alerts via email, SMS, or messaging platforms like Slack, keeping your team informed and ready to act on the insights.
