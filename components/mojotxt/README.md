# Overview

The MojoTxt API provides a robust platform for sending and receiving SMS and MMS messages, allowing users to manage contacts, groups, and automate text message workflows. Leveraging MojoTxt with Pipedream, users can integrate SMS capabilities into a variety of applications, streamlining communication processes and enhancing engagement with real-time messaging. This integration can be particularly effective in scenarios like event notifications, automated customer service, and targeted marketing campaigns.

# Example Use Cases

- **Event Reminder System**: Automate the sending of SMS reminders for upcoming events by connecting MojoTxt to Google Calendar through Pipedream. Set up a workflow where upcoming events trigger an SMS reminder to attendees a day before the event, ensuring higher attendance rates and better event engagement.

- **Customer Support Ticket Alerts**: Enhance customer service by integrating MojoTxt with a support ticketing system like Zendesk. Configure a workflow on Pipedream where new support tickets or updates to existing tickets trigger personalized SMS messages to the customer, keeping them informed about the status of their inquiries and improving overall customer satisfaction.

- **Marketing Campaign Feedback Collection**: Collect feedback via SMS by connecting MojoTxt with Google Sheets on Pipedream. Set up a campaign where after a marketing email is sent, a follow-up SMS is automatically sent asking for feedback. Responses can then be collected and logged into a Google Sheet for analysis and further action, facilitating real-time feedback and agile marketing adjustments.
