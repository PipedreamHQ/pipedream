# Overview

The Memix API offers creative control over virtual camera settings, allowing users to enhance their video call appearance with custom backgrounds, filters, and lighting adjustments. Deploying the Memix API within Pipedream workflows can automate these settings based on various triggers or schedule them as per user preference to ensure optimal video call experience across different lighting conditions or environments.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Lighting Adjustment for Time of Day**: Create a workflow that triggers at specific times of the day to adjust the lighting settings in Memix, ensuring that your video appearance remains consistently professional across all your video calls, irrespective of the natural light changes throughout the day.

- **Meeting Context Background Setter**: Leverage calendar integrations like Google Calendar in Pipedream to detect upcoming video meetings and automatically set appropriate virtual backgrounds in Memix that match the context of the meeting, such as a corporate backdrop for client calls or a more casual setting for internal team check-ins.

- **Filter and Effect Coordinator for Events**: Set up a workflow that listens for hashtags or keywords on social platforms like Twitter. Whenever a relevant event or campaign is trending, the workflow can apply a specific filter or background to your Memix virtual camera to align with the eventâ€™s theme, enhancing engagement during live streams or social interactions.
