# Overview

The CATS API provides access to CATS Applicant Tracking System functionalities, allowing for automated recruitment processes and candidate management. Through Pipedream, you can seamlessly integrate CATS with hundreds of other apps to enhance the recruitment workflow, automate applicant communication, track job postings, and analyze recruitment data.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Candidate Emails**: When a new candidate applies via CATS, use Pipedream to automatically send personalized welcome emails using Gmail or another email service. Follow-up emails can also be scheduled based on candidate status updates in CATS.

- **Sync New Candidates to Google Sheets**: Each time a new candidate is added in CATS, Pipedream can automatically add their details to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This is useful for shared visibility among HR teams, or for further processing and analysis of candidate data.

- **Job Posting Notifications**: Automatically post new job listings from CATS to company social media platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook using Pipedream. This helps in increasing the reach of job postings and attracting more candidates.
