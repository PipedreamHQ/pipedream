# Overview

The Dialpad API taps into the core of Dialpad's communication platform, allowing for the automation of voice and messaging workflows. By leveraging this API through Pipedream, you can interact with call data, manage users, and automate sending of SMS messages, among other tasks. This enables the creation of intricate, automated processes that can enhance business communication efficiency, customer support, and team collaboration within your organization.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support Ticket Creation**: When a call ends in Dialpad, trigger a workflow on Pipedream that creates a support ticket in a tool like Zendesk. Include details like caller ID, call duration, and any notes taken during the call to provide context for the support team.

- **SMS Outreach Campaigns**: Use Pipedream to listen for a specific trigger, such as a new email subscriber or a form submission. Then, send a personalized SMS via Dialpad to the new contact, providing a warm welcome or timely information about your services.

- **User Provisioning Automation**: Automate the process of setting up new employees in Dialpad when they are added to your HR system, like BambooHR. Trigger a Pipedream workflow that creates a new user in Dialpad, assigns a number, and sends an introductory email with setup instructions to the new hire.
