# Overview

The SSLMate â€” Cert Spotter API allows you to monitor SSL/TLS certificates across the web, catching potentially misissued certs and identifying certificates that could affect your domain security. By tapping into the API with Pipedream, you can automate alerts, integrate certificate data into security analyses, and streamline compliance checks by reacting to newly issued certificates in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Domain Security Monitoring**: Automate the monitoring of SSL/TLS certificates for your organization's domains. Set up a workflow in Pipedream that periodically checks for new certificates using the Cert Spotter API. If a new, unexpected certificate is spotted, trigger an alert via Email, Slack, or another communication app integrated within Pipedream.

- **Compliance Verification**: Create a Pipedream workflow that verifies the presence of SSL/TLS certificates for all your company's domains. Ensure they meet compliance standards by checking details like expiration dates and issuer credibility. If a certificate doesn't comply, the workflow could log the issue in a tool like Jira and notify the responsible team.

- **Incident Response Coordination**: Kick off incident response protocols when an unauthorized certificate is identified. Use the Cert Spotter API within Pipedream to listen for such events and, upon detection, automatically create an incident ticket in a service management platform like ServiceNow, and page the security team through PagerDuty.
