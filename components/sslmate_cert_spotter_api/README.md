# Overview

SSLMate — Cert Spotter API provides an easy way to build powerful applications
and services for working with SSL information. With the Cert Spotter API, you
can quickly access and query important SSL certificate data about domain names,
certificate fingerprints and other related information.

By connecting to SSLMate’s extensive SSL certificate repository, you can easily
build automated applications and services that can be used to monitor SSL
certificates, compare SSL certificates and detect changes in SSL certificate
properties. With the Cert Spotter API, you can build these solutions quickly
and cost-effectively, without needing to perform manual certificate checks.

Here are some examples of the solutions you can build using the SSLMate — Cert
Spotter API:

- Monitor certificates for expiration dates and alert users of expirations
- Automatically detect suspect certificates and flag them for review
- Automatically test and verify certificates for trust level
- Check for differences between certificates and find inconsistencies
- Keep track of changes in certificates over time and detect changes quickly
- Compare certificates from multiple servers
- Automatically monitor certificate locations and detect if certificates are
  moved
