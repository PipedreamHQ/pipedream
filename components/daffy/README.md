# Overview

The Daffy API lets you drive charitable giving through its platform. With Pipedream, you can automate donations, manage donor data, and integrate charitable actions within your existing workflows. You can trigger actions based on diverse events, like donations or new user registrations, and connect with other apps to streamline and scale your impact.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Acknowledgements for Donations**: Create a workflow that detects new donations through the Daffy API, then triggers an email or a message via Twilio or SendGrid to thank the donor automatically. This builds strong relationships with donors by ensuring they're appreciated promptly.

- **Sync Donation Data with CRM**: When a new donation is recorded on Daffy, use Pipedream to send that data to a CRM system like Salesforce or HubSpot. This keeps your donor records up-to-date and enables personalized outreach or future fundraising campaigns.

- **Trigger Corporate Gift Matching**: Set up a workflow where you monitor for new donations on Daffy, then check with a service like Double the Donation to see if the donorâ€™s employer matches gifts. If they do, automatically initiate the matching gift process, maximizing the donation's impact.
