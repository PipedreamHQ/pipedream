# Overview

The WhatsApp by Online Live Support API on Pipedream lets you automate interactions with WhatsApp, enabling you to send messages, create groups, and manage chats within a workflow. By leveraging this API with Pipedream's capabilities, you can craft event-driven automations that trigger actions in WhatsApp based on external events or conditions defined in other apps, such as receiving a customer support ticket, triggering a follow-up after a certain period, or coordinating team alerts.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Ticket Resolution**: When a new support ticket is created in Zendesk, use Pipedream to trigger an automated WhatsApp message to the customer, acknowledging the issue and providing an estimated time for resolution. This creates a prompt and personal line of communication.

- **E-commerce Order Updates**: Combine WooCommerce events with WhatsApp messaging to inform customers of their order status. After an order is placed, Pipedream can send a confirmation message via WhatsApp. It can also notify customers when their order is shipped or delivered for a seamless shopping experience.

- **Team Coordination Alerts**: In a Slack-driven team environment, use Pipedream to monitor for specific messages or keywords. Once detected, trigger a WhatsApp message to alert off-Slack team members. This is especially useful for urgent issues requiring immediate attention from various team members who might not be active on Slack.
