# Overview

The HumanLoop API provides a robust platform for incorporating AI and machine learning model feedback loops into applications, enabling continuous improvement of models based on human input. With Pipedream's capabilities, you can trigger workflows upon receiving data, process and analyze that data, and send it to HumanLoop to further train your AI models. This integration allows you to automate the data annotation process, handle user feedback, and improve your machine learning models over time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Annotation Pipeline**: Create a workflow in Pipedream that ingests data from various sources (like forms, emails, or databases), processes it to determine if it needs annotation, and sends it to HumanLoop. Once annotated, the data can be sent back to your ML model for retraining, all within an automated, serverless environment.

- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Connect your customer support platform to Pipedream, where you can funnel customer feedback and inquiries to HumanLoop. Use HumanLoop's interface for annotating and classifying the feedback, which can then inform business decisions, improve customer support bots, or guide product development.

- **Sentiment Analysis Improvement**: Integrate HumanLoop with a social media listening tool via Pipedream to analyze sentiment on posts related to your brand. The workflow can filter and send ambiguous cases to HumanLoop for review and annotation, which in turn refines the sentiment analysis algorithm for more accurate future detections.
