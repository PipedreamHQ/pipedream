# Overview

The Are.na API allows developers to build integrations and automations around the concept of creative content curation and sharing. Are.na is a platform designed for collecting and sharing ideas, images, and content, typically structured into channels. With the Are.na API on Pipedream, you can automate the management of channels and blocks (elements within channels), synchronize content across other apps, or curate data feeds programmatically, enhancing productivity and creative workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Content Compilation**: Create a workflow that automatically adds new RSS feed items or Tweets containing specific hashtags to an Are.na channel. This is ideal for curating content from diverse sources or sustaining thematic research.

- **Syncing Are.na Channels with a CMS**: Develop a workflow where new items added to an Are.na channel are automatically posted to a CMS like WordPress or Webflow. Use this to streamline content publication, especially useful for portfolios, blogs, or news sites.

- **Event-driven Project Management**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers when new blocks are added to a specific Are.na channel, creating corresponding tasks in project management tools like Trello or Asana. This can be used to track design inspirations, research articles, or client briefs as actionable items.
