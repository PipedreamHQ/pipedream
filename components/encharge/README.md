# Overview

The Encharge API lets you automate your marketing by managing contacts, sending emails, and tracking user actions. Using Pipedream's serverless platform, you can connect Encharge with other apps to create custom workflows. Trigger actions based on events, update user segments, or synchronize data across your marketing stack.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Lead Scoring and Tagging**: When a user signs up on your platform, use Pipedream to trigger an Encharge workflow that scores the lead and tags them based on their activity. This can then tailor subsequent marketing efforts.

- **Sync New Users to a CRM**: Once a new user is added in Encharge, automatically add them to your CRM platform, like Salesforce or HubSpot, with a Pipedream workflow. Keep all your user data in sync and accessible across your sales and marketing teams.

- **Email Campaign Triggered by User Behavior**: Monitor user activity on your website or app. When a significant event occurs, such as a user completing a purchase, you can trigger an Encharge API call with Pipedream to send a personalized follow-up email or start a drip campaign.
