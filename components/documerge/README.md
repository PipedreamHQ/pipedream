# Overview

DocuMerge API allows for dynamic document generation and management, transforming templates into customized PDFs or documents based on specific data inputs. This API is especially useful within Pipedream's ecosystem, enabling automated workflows that can integrate with various data sources and services to generate, manage, and distribute documents automatically. Leveraging Pipedreamâ€™s capabilities, you can trigger document creation from numerous events and interact with other apps for a seamless workflow.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Generation from CRM Updates**: When a new deal is marked as won in a CRM like Salesforce, trigger a workflow on Pipedream to fetch the deal details. Use DocuMerge to generate a customized contract based on these details and then email the document to the client using an email service like SendGrid.

- **On-Demand Real Estate Document Preparation**: Set up a webhook in Pipedream that listens for HTTP requests. When a real estate agent submits data through a form on your website, use this data to generate a property lease agreement with DocuMerge. The completed document can then be stored automatically in a Google Drive folder and shared with relevant parties.

- **Monthly Financial Reports Automation**: Connect DocuMerge to a financial platform like QuickBooks via Pipedream. Each month, automatically pull financial data to create a detailed financial report. Use DocuMerge to format and generate this report, then distribute it through Slack to keep the management team updated.
