# Overview

Agenty is a powerful scraping and automation tool that enables users to extract and transform data from web pages or documents. Using the Agenty API with Pipedream, you can automate the ingestion of this data, orchestrate its flow to other applications, and build complex workflows. Whether you're aggregating content, monitoring prices, or extracting data for analysis, the Agenty API facilitates these tasks by providing structured data as an output, which you can then process with Pipedream's serverless platform.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Aggregation Workflow**: Deploy a Pipedream workflow that triggers daily, using Agenty to scrape the latest articles or posts from specified news sources or blogs. Transform and filter this content with Pipedream's built-in code steps, and then push it to a CMS like WordPress or a database for content curation and publishing.

- **Price Monitoring System**: Create a workflow that regularly checks product prices on e-commerce sites using Agenty. Compare the scraped pricing data with your internal pricing database using Pipedream's SQL Service to find discrepancies or opportunities. Alert the sales team via email, Slack, or SMS through Twilio when significant price changes are detected.

- **Lead Generation Engine**: Use Agenty to extract data from online directories or professional networking sites. Process and enrich this data with Pipedream, adding additional information from services like Clearbit or FullContact. Then, automatically feed the enriched leads into a CRM platform like Salesforce or HubSpot, keeping your sales funnel filled with fresh prospects.
