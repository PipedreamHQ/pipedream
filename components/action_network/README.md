# Action Network

With the Action Network API, you can build applications that help people take action on the issues they care about. Here are some examples of what you can build:

- A petition app that lets people sign petitions and share them with their friends
- A campaigning app that lets people donate to candidates and Causes, and track their progress
- An event app that lets people find and RSVP to events near them
- A groups app that lets people find and join groups working on issues they care about
