# Overview

Lnk.Bio is a simple tool for creating micro landing pages that house all of your links in one place, often used for social media profiles like Instagram. With the Lnk.Bio API on Pipedream, you can automate the management of these links, pulling link data into other apps, or triggering actions based on link activity. Imagine updating links dynamically based on inventory levels from an e-commerce platform, or sending notifications when new links are added.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Link Updates Based on Product Inventory**  
  Use the Lnk.Bio API to check product inventory levels from a Shopify store and automatically update Lnk.Bio links to show "Out of Stock" or redirect to alternative products when inventory runs low.

- **Sync New Lnk.Bio Links to a Google Sheet**  
  Every time a new link is added to your Lnk.Bio page, trigger a Pipedream workflow that adds the link details to a Google Sheet. This could be useful for tracking and analytics purposes, ensuring you keep a live database of all active links.

- **Send Notifications on Link Engagement**  
  Monitor your Lnk.Bio link activity and use Pipedream to send a Slack message or an email via SendGrid when a link receives a certain number of clicks, allowing you to gauge the effectiveness of your social media campaigns in real-time.
