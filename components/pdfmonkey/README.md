# Overview

The PDFMonkey API on Pipedream allows you to automate the creation of PDF documents from dynamic data sources. You can generate invoices, reports, tickets, or any customized document based on templates you define. With Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform, you can trigger PDF generation from a multitude of events, such as form submissions, scheduled times, or changes in a database, and then perform actions like sending these PDFs via email, storing them in cloud storage, or updating records in a CRM.

# Example Use Cases

- **Invoice Generation Workflow**: Automate the creation of invoices by triggering a workflow on Pipedream whenever a new order is placed in an eCommerce platform like Shopify. The workflow can generate a PDF invoice using PDFMonkey, and then send it to the customer through an email service like SendGrid, all without manual intervention.

- **Monthly Reports Automation**: Set up a scheduled workflow in Pipedream to generate monthly performance reports. Connect to a data source like Google Sheets or a SQL database to retrieve the data, use PDFMonkey to create a polished PDF report, and then distribute it to stakeholders through Dropbox or email, ensuring consistent and timely reporting.

- **Event Ticketing System**: Whenever a user registers for an event through a platform like Eventbrite, trigger a workflow on Pipedream that uses PDFMonkey to generate a personalized event ticket. The ticket can then be sent automatically to the registrant via an email delivery service, or stored in a database for later retrieval.
