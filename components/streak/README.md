# Overview

The Streak API taps into the core of Streakâ€™s CRM functionality within Gmail, allowing users to automate interactions with pipeline data, such as leads, contacts, and sales opportunities. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to craft serverless workflows that react to events in Streak and connect with countless other services to streamline CRM tasks, sync data across platforms, or trigger communications based on pipeline changes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Lead Follow-Up Emails**: Trigger an automated email sequence when a new lead is added to a Streak pipeline, using Gmail or a third-party email service. Tailor follow-up content based on lead data from Streak to create a personalized touch without manual effort.

- **Pipeline Change Notifications**: Send real-time alerts via Slack or another messaging platform when a deal moves to a new stage in your Streak pipeline. Keep the team instantly informed about progress without them having to constantly check their CRM.

- **Data Synchronization with Google Sheets**: Automatically export new and updated pipeline data to a Google Sheet for reporting and analysis. Use this to keep backup records, generate custom reports, or feed data into other analytics tools for deeper insights.
