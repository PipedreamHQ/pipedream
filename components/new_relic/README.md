# Overview

The New Relic API offers powerful capabilities for monitoring, alerting, and analyzing the performance of your web applications and infrastructure. By using the API within Pipedream, you can automate and orchestrate a vast array of operations that revolve around your application's health and data insights. This can range from triggering workflows based on New Relic alerts, to syncing performance data with other tools, or even automating responses to specific incidents.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Incident Response**: When New Relic detects an anomaly or a performance issue, it can trigger a Pipedream workflow that automatically posts a message to a Slack channel, alerting the relevant team. The workflow could also create a ticket in Jira, ensuring that the incident is tracked and managed properly.

- **Performance Metrics to Data Warehouse**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that periodically fetches performance metrics from New Relic and inserts this data into a Google BigQuery data warehouse. This allows for advanced analysis alongside other business metrics, giving a more comprehensive view of how application performance impacts the overall business.

- **Dynamic Configuration Updates**: If New Relic reports that a service is experiencing high traffic, a Pipedream workflow can interact with other APIs, such as a feature flagging service like LaunchDarkly, to dynamically adjust application features or throttle user access to maintain service stability.
