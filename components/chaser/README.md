# Overview

The Chaser API empowers users to automate their accounts receivable process efficiently. By integrating with Pipedream, you can create seamless automation workflows for invoice chasing, payment reminders, and coordinating communication with customers. This API can streamline your credit control processes, saving your business time and improving cash flow.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Payment Reminder System**: Set up a workflow that triggers an automatic reminder email to customers whose invoices are due or overdue. This can be scheduled at regular intervals and can stop once payment is confirmed, ensuring timely follow-ups and maintaining customer relations without manual effort.

- **Invoice Status Tracking**: Connect Chaser with your accounting software (like QuickBooks or Xero) on Pipedream to track the status of invoices. Whenever an invoice is marked as "sent" in your accounting software, automatically create or update a chase in Chaser to begin the follow-up process.

- **Consolidated Communication Logs**: Integrate Chaser with a CRM platform (such as Salesforce) to log all communication with customers regarding payments. After every automated chase, the workflow can append details of the interaction to the customer's record in the CRM, ensuring a single source of truth for all team members.
