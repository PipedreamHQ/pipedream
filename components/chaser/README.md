# Overview

The Chaser API enables users to automate their accounts receivable process efficiently, making it possible to manage and follow up on invoices programmatically. By integrating Chaser with Pipedream, users can automate invoice reminders, synchronize financial data with other business applications, and generate detailed accounts receivable reports. These capabilities help businesses improve their cash flow and minimize the time spent on manual follow-ups.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Reminders**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream that triggers weekly, based on the payment due date of invoices. Use the Chaser API to send customized reminder emails to clients whose payments are overdue. This reduces the manual effort required in managing follow-ups and helps maintain consistent cash flow.

- **Sync Invoices with Accounting Software**: Create a workflow that triggers whenever a new invoice is added in Chaser. Use this trigger to automatically copy the invoice details to your accounting software (like QuickBooks or Xero), ensuring that your financial records are always up-to-date without manual data entry.

- **Generate and Send Financial Reports**: Implement a monthly workflow on Pipedream that uses the Chaser API to gather all receivables data and compile it into a comprehensive financial report. This report can then be automatically emailed to stakeholders using an email service like SendGrid or directly through SMTP steps available in Pipedream. This automation ensures that all pertinent parties are regularly updated with the latest financial statuses without any manual intervention.
