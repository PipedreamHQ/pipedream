# Overview

The DNSFilter API enables you to automate interactions with your DNSFilter account, offering capabilities like managing filtered domains, accessing reports, updating settings, and more. Within Pipedream, you can wield this API for seamless and serverless integrations, crafting workflows that trigger on specified conditions, process DNSFilter data, and interact with other apps and services, all without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Domain Management**: Sync a list of blocked or allowed domains from a corporate database to DNSFilter, ensuring real-time updates of filtering rules across your network.

- **Security Alerts Integration**: Create a workflow that listens for threat alerts from DNSFilter. Use this to trigger notifications in messaging platforms like Slack, or log the incidents in a SIEM system like Splunk for further analysis.

- **Scheduled Reporting**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to generate and retrieve DNSFilter reports on a schedule. These can be sent to Google Sheets for data analysis or emailed to stakeholders for regular updates on network activity.
