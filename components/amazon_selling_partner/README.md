# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Amazon Orders to Google Sheets for Real-Time Analytics**: Automate the process of extracting order data from Amazon and pushing it to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. Use this workflow to maintain an up-to-date log of all transactions, which can be used for real-time sales analysis and inventory management.

- **Automated Inventory Management with Slack Notifications**: Set up a workflow where inventory levels from Amazon are monitored and updates are sent to Slack. This enables quick team notifications when stock levels are low, ensuring that inventory can be replenished in a timely manner without manual monitoring.

- **Dynamic Pricing Adjustments Based on Competitor's Pricing**: Create an automation that monitors competitor pricing and adjusts your Amazon product prices accordingly. This strategy helps maintain competitive pricing automatically and can potentially increase sales without constant manual oversight.
