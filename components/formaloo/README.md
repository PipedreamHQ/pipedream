# Overview

The Formaloo API lets you interact with your forms and data on Formaloo. You can create new forms, fetch responses, analyze submissions, and more, right within Pipedream. Pipedream's serverless platform facilitates the automation of these tasks, enabling you to integrate Formaloo with hundreds of other services to streamline workflows, analyze data, and synchronize across platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Response Collection**: Use Pipedream to trigger a workflow every time a new form submission is received on Formaloo. Capture the data, process it, and store it in a database like PostgreSQL or send it to Google Sheets for further analysis.

- **Dynamic Form Creation**: With the Formaloo API on Pipedream, create workflows that dynamically generate new forms based on events from other apps, such as Trello or Asana. When a new project is created in your project management tool, trigger a workflow that creates a corresponding feedback form in Formaloo.

- **Form Submission Notifications**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that sends a notification through email, Slack, or Discord whenever a form is submitted. This can keep your team instantly informed about new entries, customer feedback, or survey responses, ensuring timely responses and engagement.
