# Overview

The TrackingTime API enables the automation of time tracking, task management, and reporting processes. In Pipedream, you can use this API to create powerful workflows that connect TrackingTime with other apps to streamline productivity, enhance project management, and generate insights on time allocation. Automate tasks based on project activities, sync time entries with calendars, or trigger notifications based on tracked time data.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automatically Log Time for Scheduled Meetings**: Sync your TrackingTime projects with Google Calendar events. Whenever a new event starts, trigger a workflow that logs time in TrackingTime for the duration of the event, ensuring accurate time tracking for meetings.

- **Generate Weekly Time Reports**: Set up a weekly scheduled workflow that retrieves time tracking data from TrackingTime and compiles it into a report. This report can then be sent via email using a service like SendGrid, keeping stakeholders updated on time investment and project progress.

- **Project Management Integration**: When a task is marked as completed in a project management tool like Trello, trigger a workflow that automatically stops the corresponding time entry in TrackingTime. This keeps your time records in sync with project milestones and deliverables.
