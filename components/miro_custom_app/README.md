# Overview

The Miro Developer App API lets you extend the functionality of Miro, an online collaborative whiteboarding platform. On Pipedream, you can automate interactions with Miro boards, such as creating or updating content, and extracting data for reporting or integration purposes. This can streamline collaboration and project management by automating repetitive tasks and connecting Miro with other tools and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Meeting Prep**: Set up a workflow that creates a new board in Miro with predefined templates before each scheduled meeting in Google Calendar. This can ensure that every meeting starts with the necessary structure and materials.

- **Real-time Collaboration Sync**: Whenever a team member adds a sticky note to a Miro board, trigger a workflow that posts the content to a Slack channel. This keeps the entire team updated on brainstorming sessions without switching contexts.

- **Task Tracking Integration**: Combine the power of Miro and Trello by automating the creation of Trello cards for each new frame added to a Miro board. This helps in turning brainstorming sessions into actionable tasks seamlessly.
