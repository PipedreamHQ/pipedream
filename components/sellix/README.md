# Overview

The Sellix API allows developers to automate tasks and integrate their digital storefront with other services. Sellix provides e-commerce solutions that focus on selling digital products, subscriptions, and services. Using the Sellix API on Pipedream, businesses can automate order processing, customer management, and real-time notifications, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and customer service.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Order Fulfillment**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream that listens for new orders on Sellix. When a new order is detected, automatically fulfill the order by sending product keys or download links to the customer's email. This workflow can integrate with SendGrid or another email service on Pipedream to handle email dispatch.

- **Real-Time Inventory Updates**: Connect Sellix to a Google Sheets document via Pipedream. Whenever a sale is made, a Pipedream workflow can update the inventory count in a Google Sheet in real-time. This keeps track of stock levels without manual intervention, ensuring that the storefront reflects the current inventory status accurately.

- **Customer Support Automation**: Implement a workflow where Pipedream connects Sellix with a CRM app like Salesforce. Every time a purchase occurs, or a customer issues a refund request on Sellix, the relevant customer data and order information can be logged automatically in Salesforce. This helps in providing timely support and maintaining detailed customer records for future reference.
