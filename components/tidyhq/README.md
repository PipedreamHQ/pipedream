# Overview

TidyHQ is a club and membership management tool that helps organizations streamline their operations using a centralized platform. Via the TidyHQ API on Pipedream, you can automate tasks, sync data across various platforms, and enhance member engagement. This API facilitates direct interactions with member data, event management, task scheduling, and communications, enabling users to automate administrative tasks, thereby saving time and reducing errors.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automating Membership Renewal Notifications**: Use the TidyHQ API to monitor membership expiry dates and automatically send renewal reminders via email or SMS. This workflow can connect with the Twilio API on Pipedream to manage SMS sending and the SendGrid API for emails, ensuring members receive timely notifications.

- **Syncing Event Attendees to a Google Sheet**: When a new event is created in TidyHQ, automate the addition of event details and attendee lists to a Google Sheet. This is particularly useful for real-time sharing and collaboration on event management tasks. It uses TidyHQ API to fetch event data and Google Sheets API on Pipedream to manage spreadsheet operations.

- **Streamlining Meeting Scheduling**: Automate the process of scheduling meetings following new member sign-ups. Once a new membership application is approved, trigger a workflow that schedules an orientation or initial meeting using the Google Calendar API. This can help ensure new members are integrated into the organization smoothly and efficiently.
