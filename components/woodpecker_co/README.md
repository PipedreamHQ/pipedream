# Overview

The Woodpecker.co API lets you automate your email outreach and follow-up processes. With it, you can manage contacts, campaigns, and emails programmatically, creating a seamless bridge between your email campaigns and your data. This API, integrated with Pipedream, unlocks powerful workflows that can save time, personalize communication at scale, and keep your data in sync across various platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Lead Nurturing Workflow**: Trigger a sequence of personalized follow-up emails to new leads captured from your CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. When a new lead is added to your CRM, use Pipedream to automatically add their contact information to a Woodpecker.co campaign, ensuring they receive timely, targeted communication that moves them down the sales funnel.

- **Feedback Collection Automation**: After closing a deal or completing a project, automatically send out a feedback request email using Woodpecker.co. Connect it to a form app like Typeform on Pipedream, so when a client fills out a feedback form, their responses trigger a thank-you email and the data is stored for analysis, helping you to improve services or products continuously.

- **Webinar Attendee Follow-Up**: Enhance engagement with webinar attendees by setting up a post-webinar follow-up sequence. Once Pipedream detects a new attendee registration in your webinar platform, such as Zoom, add the attendee to a dedicated Woodpecker.co campaign that sends out a thank-you email, additional resources, and even sets reminders for future webinars, all aimed at keeping your brand at the top of their mind.
