# Overview

The Reflect API offers a platform for creating automated tests without writing code. It enables users to build workflows that can record and replay web interactions, check the functionality and performance of web applications, and trigger alerts or actions based on test results. With Pipedream, you can harness the Reflect API to integrate automated testing into complex workflows, combining it with various apps and services for a seamless DevOps experience.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Regression Testing**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to trigger Reflect tests after code commits. Connect it with GitHub to listen for `push` events and automatically run relevant tests, ensuring that new changes don't break existing functionality.

- **Scheduled UI Testing**: Create a workflow that triggers Reflect UI tests at regular intervals. You can schedule tests to run nightly, ensuring your application's front-end remains consistent and functional without manual intervention.

- **Alerts and Notifications Based on Test Results**: Configure a Pipedream workflow where Reflect API test results are evaluated, and depending on outcome, it sends notifications. Integrate with Slack to alert your team immediately if a test fails, allowing for rapid response to potential issues.
