# Overview

The FracTEL API enables integration of advanced telecommunications features into applications, allowing for the management of voice and messaging functionalities. This API can be particularly powerful when used on Pipedream, where it can be combined with hundreds of other apps to create robust, automated workflows. These can range from triggering calls based on specific events to automating SMS notifications for critical alerts.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Ticket Voice Alerts**: Automatically initiate a phone call via FracTEL to a support manager when a high-priority support ticket is created in a system like Zendesk. This ensures immediate attention to critical issues without delay.

- **Event-Driven SMS Notifications**: Set up a workflow where FracTEL sends a text message to a list of attendees from a Google Sheets spreadsheet whenever a new event is scheduled in a Google Calendar. This keeps everyone informed and can increase event attendance.

- **Voicemail Transcription and Analysis**: Capture voicemails received on FracTEL, transcribe them using an AI service like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, and analyze the sentiment with Google Cloud Natural Language API. This can help in prioritizing responses based on the urgency and sentiment of the voicemail.
