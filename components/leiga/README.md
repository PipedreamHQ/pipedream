# Overview

The Leiga API unlocks the potential to automate and streamline your graphic design operations. By integrating with Pipedream, you can trigger workflows using events from other apps, manipulate and store data, or even orchestrate complex operations among various services. Whether you're looking to automate image processing, streamline asset management, or create dynamic marketing campaigns, Pipedream's serverless platform lets you build scalable and efficient workflows with the Leiga API.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Image Processing Pipeline**: Use the Leiga API to create a workflow that listens for new images uploaded to a cloud storage platform like Dropbox. Once a new image is detected, the workflow can automatically send it to Leiga for processing, and then store the processed image back in Dropbox or another service like Google Drive.

- **Dynamic Marketing Material Generation**: Combine Leiga with a CRM app like HubSpot in Pipedream. Set up a workflow to generate personalized marketing materials using customer data from HubSpot. When a new lead is added to your CRM, Pipedream can trigger Leiga to produce custom graphics tailored to the lead's interests, significantly enhancing your engagement strategy.

- **Social Media Content Management**: Integrate Leiga API with social media platforms such as Twitter or Instagram via Pipedream. Construct a workflow where design requests posted to a specific Slack channel are automatically picked up, processed through Leiga to create social media-ready images, and then posted to your chosen social media accounts, all without manual intervention.
