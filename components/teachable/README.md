# Overview

The Teachable API opens up possibilities for automating and enhancing online course interactions and management. Using Pipedream, you can weave together workflows that interact with Teachable events, users, and courses. You can automate enrollment processes, synchronize course data with external systems, and engage students with timely notifications. Pipedream's serverless platform lets you create these workflows with minimal setup, leveraging its ability to trigger actions based on Teachable events or on a schedule, and to integrate with hundreds of other apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Enrollment Notifications**: Trigger a workflow whenever a new user enrolls in a Teachable course. Use Pipedream to send a personalized welcome email through SendGrid, thanking them for signing up and providing them with starter resources.

- **Course Progression Monitoring**: Set up a workflow that monitors student progress and triggers when a student completes a course section. The action could be to congratulate them via Twilio SMS and unlock a bonus resource, or to add them to a segmented email campaign in Mailchimp for advanced topics.

- **Synchronize Teachable Data with Google Sheets**: Create a workflow that runs on a schedule to fetch new course sign-ups and completion data. Use this data to update a Google Sheets spreadsheet, giving you a live dashboard of student engagement and course performance.
