# Overview

Pipedream's integration with the Pivotal Tracker API turns your project management into a powerhouse of automation and connectivity. It allows you to orchestrate workflows that can respond to changes in your projects, stories, and tasks in real-time. For instance, you can sync project updates with other tools, extract metrics for reporting, or even streamline notification systems to keep your entire team in the loop effortlessly.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Task Distribution**: When a new story is created in Pivotal Tracker, Pipedream triggers a workflow that automatically assigns tasks to developers based on their current workload or expertise, which is tracked in a separate database or app like Airtable.

- **Slack Project Updates**: Keep your team informed with real-time alerts. Set up a workflow where any status changes in Pivotal Tracker stories push notifications to a dedicated Slack channel, ensuring that everyone is aware of project progress without needing to leave their communication platform.

- **Sprint Report Generation**: At the end of each sprint, Pipedream can collate completed stories and tasks from Pivotal Tracker, format them into a comprehensive report, and then send this report via email or store it in a shared Google Drive folder for stakeholders' review.
