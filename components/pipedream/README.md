# Overview

Pipedream is a robust integration platform that lets you automate workflows using APIs without needing to manage complex infrastructure. This platform supports a wide range of applications, providing built-in connectivity to many apps and the ability to handle custom logic via Node.js code steps. With Pipedream, you can trigger workflows with HTTP requests, schedule them, or link them to app events, transforming and routing data to various services seamlessly.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Collection and Reporting**: Use Pipedream to automate the collection of data from various sources like APIs (weather, social media metrics, etc.), process this data, and send a compiled report to Google Sheets or via email. For instance, you could set up a daily workflow that pulls sales figures from an e-commerce platform and posts a summary in a Slack channel.

- **IoT Event Monitoring and Alerts**: Connect IoT devices to Pipedream via Webhooks or MQTT and set up workflows to monitor data like temperature or motion sensors. When certain thresholds are exceeded, trigger notifications via SMS using Twilio, or log the event in a Google Spreadsheet for further analysis.

- **Social Media Automation**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that listens for new posts on platforms like Twitter or Instagram using their respective APIs. Automatically analyze the content for keywords using a machine learning model hosted on AWS Lambda, then repost the filtered content to other social platforms or notify your team in a Discord channel for manual review.
