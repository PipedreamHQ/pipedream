# Overview

The Papyrs API facilitates the creation and manipulation of rich text documents in your Papyrs intranet. With it, you can automate the handling of text-documents, forms, and pages within your organization's Papyrs account. When combined with Pipedream's capacity to connect to various APIs, the Papyrs API can be a powerful tool for document-driven workflow automation. You can trigger actions in Papyrs based on events from other apps, process Papyrs data for insights, or synchronize Papyrs content with external systems, databases, or file storage solutions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Employee Onboarding Documents**: Create an onboarding page in Papyrs for each new employee automatically when they are added to your HR management system (e.g., BambooHR). Store necessary paperwork and guides relevant to their role, and share them with the new hire.

- **Customer Feedback Compilation**: Collect customer feedback via a form on your website. When a new submission is received, use the Papyrs API to add this feedback to a centralized Papyrs document, making it easy for your team to review and act on.

- **Meeting Notes Archival**: After a meeting ends in your calendar app (e.g., Google Calendar), trigger a Pipedream workflow to create a new page in Papyrs with the meeting's name and date, then append transcribed notes or summaries for future reference.
