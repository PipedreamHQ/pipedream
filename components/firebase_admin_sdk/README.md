With the Firebase Admin SDK API, you can build a variety of different applications and tools. For example, you could build a tool to manage your Firebase project's users, or a tool to monitor your Firebase project's data usage. You could also build an app that helps you manage your Firebase project's settings, or an app that helps you troubleshoot your Firebase project's data.
