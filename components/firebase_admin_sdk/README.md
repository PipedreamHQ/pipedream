# Overview

With the Firebase Admin SDK API, you can build a variety of different
applications and tools. For example, you could build a tool to manage your
Firebase project's users, or a tool to monitor your Firebase project's data
usage. You could also build an app that helps you manage your Firebase
project's settings, or an app that helps you troubleshoot your Firebase
project's data.
