# Overview

Florm API allows you to craft surveys, quizzes, and forms and collect responses through a simple interface. With Pipedream, you can automate workflows by connecting Florm to various apps, triggering actions based on form submissions, and manipulating Florm data to fit your needs. Think of it as a bridge that lets your form responses flow into other systems, triggering emails, database updates, or even complex business logic.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Response Handling**: When a new response is submitted to a Florm form, Pipedream can automatically process that data. For instance, you could create a workflow that adds new leads to a CRM like Salesforce, tags them based on their answers, and sends a personalized email follow-up via SendGrid.

- **Real-Time Notifications**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for new Florm submissions and sends a Slack or Discord message to your team. This way, you can keep everyone in the loop about customer feedback or survey results the moment they come in.

- **Data Aggregation**: Use Pipedream to funnel Florm responses into a Google Sheet for easy tracking and analysis. You can append new responses to a sheet, organize them based on criteria, or even integrate with Google Data Studio for advanced reporting and visualization.
