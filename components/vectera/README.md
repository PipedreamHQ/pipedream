# Overview

The Vectera API enables users to streamline scheduling and video meeting management directly within their own platforms or through integration with other services. With the Vectera API, you can automate the creation of meeting rooms, manage contacts, and handle meeting recordings. Leverage Pipedream's capabilities to trigger workflows from various events, process data, and connect Vectera with other apps to create powerful automations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Meeting Room Creation**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream whenever a new event is scheduled in your calendar app (e.g., Google Calendar). The workflow creates a new Vectera meeting room and sends the details to participants via email or a messaging app like Slack.

- **Contact Synchronization**: Sync contacts between Vectera and a CRM platform like Salesforce. Whenever a new contact is added to Salesforce, a corresponding contact can be automatically created in Vectera, ensuring that meeting invites are always sent to up-to-date email addresses.

- **Meeting Recording Processing**: After a meeting ends, trigger a Pipedream workflow to download the recording from Vectera. The workflow can then upload the recording to a cloud storage service like Google Drive and send a notification with the link to participants or stakeholders.
