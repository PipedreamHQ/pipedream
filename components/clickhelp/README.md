# Overview

The ClickHelp API allows technical writers to automate and interact with the ClickHelp documentation platform programmatically. With this API, Pipedream users can create, update, retrieve, and manage documentation projects, topics, and users within ClickHelp. It opens up opportunities to streamline documentation workflows, integrate with content management systems, and trigger notifications based on documentation changes or reviews.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Documentation Backup**  
  Build a workflow in Pipedream to automatically back up ClickHelp projects to a cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox at regular intervals. This ensures that you always have an up-to-date copy of your documentation, providing an extra layer of data protection.

- **Documentation Review and Approval Process**  
  Create a Pipedream workflow that triggers when a new topic is added or updated in ClickHelp. It can notify stakeholders through Slack or email to review the content. Once reviewed, the workflow can update the topic status in ClickHelp based on the feedback received, streamlining the review process.

- **Syncing Help Content with a CRM**  
  Develop a workflow on Pipedream that synchronizes ClickHelp documentation with a CRM like Salesforce. When new documentation is published or existing documents are updated in ClickHelp, the workflow can update the corresponding records or files in Salesforce, ensuring the sales team has access to the latest help content.
