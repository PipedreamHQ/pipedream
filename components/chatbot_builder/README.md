# Overview

The Chatbot Builder API allows you to create and manage customized chatbots that can interact with users in real-time. Within Pipedream's serverless platform, this API can be harnessed to build powerful workflows that react to messages, automate responses, and integrate with a plethora of other services. With Pipedream, you can set up event-driven processes, making it easy to manage chatbot activities, analyze conversations, and trigger actions in other apps based on chatbot interactions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Automation**: Use the Chatbot Builder API to handle common customer inquiries on your site. When a customer message is recognized, Pipedream can trigger a workflow to fetch relevant account information from a CRM like Salesforce, and then send personalized assistance directly through the chatbot.

- **Survey Distribution and Analysis**: Create a workflow where the chatbot distributes surveys to users. Pipedream can capture survey responses, push this data to a Google Sheet for analysis, and even trigger follow-up emails via SendGrid to thank participants or offer incentives.

- **Real-time Order Updates**: Implement a system where customers can inquire about their order status through the chatbot. Pipedream can listen for these specific queries, pull order details from an e-commerce platform like Shopify, and deliver real-time updates back to the customer through the chatbot.
