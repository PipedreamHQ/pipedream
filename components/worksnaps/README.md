- Timesheet Tracking and Management System: Track employee time and project
  progress in real-time, view reports on employee and team performance,
  generate activity reports and invoices.

  engagement, analyze how individual and team performance is affected by events
  and changes in the environment, and provide feedback and motivation to
  employees.
- Automated Task and Project Management: Create custom workflows that are
  optimized for team performance and client satisfaction, manage team task
  lists and deadlines, organize projects in a shared workspace and assign tasks
  to individual employees.
- Analytics and Insights: Generate interactive insights into team and employee
  performance, track projects and tasks over time, discover patterns in project
