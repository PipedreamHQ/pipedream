# Overview

The Toggl Track API allows developers to build apps that help measure and
visualize employee productivity. Using the API, it is possible to build tools
such as timesheet managers, project-based dashboards, expense analysis, team
management applications, and more.

The Toggl Track API also offers data overviews and integrated reporting, as
well as access to Toggl Track’s easy-to-use user interface. This facilitates
the creation of customized application features that can help businesses save
time and maximize productivity.

Here are a few examples of what you can build using the Toggl Track API:

- Timesheet manager: Create an application that gives users an overview of
  their time tracking data.
- Project-based dashboard: Visualize employee’s performance data on a
  project-by-project basis.
- Expense analysis: Analyze employees' expense data so that businesses can make
  more informed decisions.
- Team management applications: Manage employee workloads more efficiently with
  customized tools.
- Customized reports: Build customized reports based on specific criteria
  related to time tracking data.
- User interface: Access and integrate Toggl Track's intuitive user interface
  into applications.

- The API Reference has been updated to V9 and has been relocated [here](https://developers.track.toggl.com/)
- This current implementation in pipdream only utilizes time entries. Toggl also offers coverage at the workspace level down to the individual task level. The workspace docs located [here](https://developers.track.toggl.com/docs/api/workspaces) provide insight in how to begin creating workspaces and allowing other individuals to be added to those workspaces allowing the tracking of whole teams at a time.
