# Overview

Toggl Track is a time tracking API that lets you start, stop, and manage timers and time entries, as well as manage projects, clients, and tasks associated with time records. With the Toggl Track API on Pipedream, you can automate time tracking activities, synchronize data across platforms, and generate insights from time tracking data to improve productivity and project management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Project Time Tracking Automation:** Automatically start a Toggl timer when you begin working on a GitHub issue. When the issue is closed, stop the timer. This creates a seamless link between your coding activity and time tracking.

- **Client Reporting Workflow:** Generate weekly time reports for clients by aggregating Toggl data and sending it via Gmail. Use the Pipedream workflow to filter time entries by client and project, compile the data, and format it into a nicely structured email.

- **Slack Productivity Bot:** Create a Slack bot that prompts team members to log their time if they haven't started a timer by midday. Use Toggl's API to check for active timers and send reminders through Slack, encouraging timely time entry submissions.
