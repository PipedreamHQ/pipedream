# Overview

The Wicked Reports API offers analytical insights into marketing performance, tracking customer journeys, sales, and ROI over time. On Pipedream, you can harness these insights to trigger actions, feed data into other apps, or customize reporting. By integrating Wicked Reports API, you can automate data collection, react to new marketing data in real-time, and build workflows that connect marketing performance to other business processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Marketing Data with CRM**: Automatically update your CRM records when a new sale or lead is detected in Wicked Reports. This keeps your sales team informed with the latest conversion data.

- **Email Campaign Analysis**: After sending out an email campaign, use the Wicked Reports API to gather campaign performance data and send it to a Google Sheet for easy analysis and visualization.

- **Real-time Alerts for Marketing Performance**: Set up a workflow that monitors key performance indicators from Wicked Reports. When thresholds are crossed (like a sudden drop in ROI or a spike in lead generation), trigger notifications via Slack or email to prompt immediate action.
