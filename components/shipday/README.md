# Overview

The Shipday API lets you manage and automate delivery operations seamlessly. By integrating with Pipedream, you can orchestrate workflows that trigger from various events, sync data between services, and automate notifications or order tracking. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can craft custom workflows that react in real-time to changes in delivery statuses, new order placements, or updates from other integrated services. This flexibility allows businesses to enhance their delivery processes, improve customer communication, and streamline operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Order Dispatch**: When a new order is received in your e-commerce platform (like Shopify), use Shipday's API within Pipedream to automatically create a delivery. This cuts down on manual entry and speeds up the delivery process.

- **Real-time Delivery Status Updates**: Set up a workflow that listens for webhook events from Shipday for delivery status changes. Whenever a delivery status is updated, trigger a Pipedream workflow to send real-time notifications to customers via email or SMS, keeping them informed every step of the way.

- **Synchronize Delivery Data with Google Sheets**: As deliveries are completed, use Pipedream to capture data from Shipday and append it to a Google Sheet. This workflow is useful for generating real-time reports, tracking delivery performance, or maintaining records without manual data entry.
