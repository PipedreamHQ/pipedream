# Example Use Cases

- **User Verification Automation**: Automatically trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a new user signs up on your platform. Use the Paradym API to verify the user's identity, including document validation and biometric checks. If the verification is successful, automatically update the user's status in your database, using the SQL service on Pipedream.

- **Enhanced KYC Process**: In financial services or markets requiring high-security measures, connect the Paradym API with CRM systems like Salesforce or HubSpot on Pipedream. When a new client fills a KYC form, automatically initiate identity verification. Post-verification, update the client's profile in the CRM with verification status and any pertinent notes.

- **Fraud Prevention in E-commerce**: Integrate the Paradym API with e-commerce platforms like Shopify or WooCommerce on Pipedream. Set up a workflow that triggers when a high-value transaction is initiated. Verify the identity of the purchaser to ensure legitimacy and reduce the risk of fraudulent transactions. Update the transaction status based on verification results, and notify your customer service team to take appropriate action if needed.
