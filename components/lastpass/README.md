# Overview

The LastPass Enterprise API lets you automate and manage user access, shared folders, and security settings within your LastPass Enterprise account. With this API integrated in Pipedream, you can create workflows that streamline your password management tasks, enforce security policies, and sync with your organization's user directory. It's a secure way to manage credentials across your company's workforce, without constantly diving into the LastPass dashboard.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated User Provisioning and Deprovisioning**: Configure a workflow that listens for new employee entries in your HR system, like BambooHR or Workday. When a new employee is added, automatically create a LastPass Enterprise user account with pre-defined access. Conversely, when an employee leaves, ensure their LastPass access is revoked to maintain security.

- **Security Compliance Reporting**: Keep track of who has access to what, and when changes occur. Use the LastPass Enterprise API to fetch logs and access reports, then send this data to a Google Sheet or a database like PostgreSQL on Pipedream. This workflow can be scheduled to run at regular intervals, providing up-to-date compliance information.

- **Password Rotation Enforcement**: Pair LastPass with a cron job workflow on Pipedream that triggers a password update action for shared accounts. This workflow could interface with your development tools, like GitHub or AWS, to rotate credentials for service accounts or CI/CD pipelines, aligning with best security practices and minimizing risk.
