# Overview

The Todoist Custom App API on Pipedream enables you to automate your task management by connecting Todoist with a vast array of other applications and services. Capitalize on this to sync tasks across platforms, escalate priority items, or trigger reminders and actions based on activity within Todoist. From sending a Slack message when a task is due to adding tasks via email parsing, the possibilities are extensive for boosting productivity and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Task Completion Notifications**: Automate sending a message to a Slack channel when a task is marked complete in Todoist. Keep your team updated in real-time without manual updates, enhancing team communication and project tracking.

- **Email to Task Conversion**: Use an incoming email to trigger the creation of a Todoist task. Parse important details from the email using Pipedream's built-in code steps and populate them into a new Todoist task, ensuring that action items from emails are captured and tracked efficiently.

- **Daily Task Digest**: Compile and send a daily digest of tasks due that day from Todoist to your preferred communication platform, such as Microsoft Teams. Use Pipedream's scheduled triggers to automate the process, providing a clear overview of the day's priorities every morning.
