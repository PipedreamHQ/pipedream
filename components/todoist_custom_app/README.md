# Overview

Todoist's Custom Apps API allows developers to extend capabilities of the
Todoist platform by creating custom applications that integrate seamlessly with
the Todoist ecosystem.  This allows developers to remove barriers to doing
tasks, automate processes, and make working with Todoist more efficient and
enjoyable.  Here are some examples of what you can build with the Custom Apps
API:

- Automate task management by creating an app that moves tasks from one project
  to the next with preset parameters.
- Create an app that automates task creation for multi-step processes.
- Create an app to better keep track of your team's progress on tasks.
- Automate the flow of data from third-party calendars and services into
  Todoist.
- Create an app that lets you monitor your task completion metrics.
- Create an app that sends notifications from Todoist in different formats to
  different services.
- Automate the entry of task descriptions with natural language processing.
- Create an app to automate reporting on task completion.
- Create an app to allow you to access and modify your Todoist tasks in other
  applications.
- Create an app that allows you to export and import your Todoist data in
  various formats.
