# Overview

The 1msg API enables users to send SMS messages programmatically. On Pipedream, you can leverage this capability within serverless workflows. This is useful for automating notifications, sending verification codes, or integrating SMS messaging into broader communication strategies. By connecting 1msg with other apps on Pipedream, you can orchestrate complex workflows that trigger SMS messages based on various events.

# Example Use Cases

- **E-Commerce Order Confirmation**: After a customer places an order on your e-commerce platform, automatically send them an SMS confirmation using 1msg. This enhances the customer experience with immediate communication.

- **Appointment Reminders**: Sync 1msg with a calendaring app like Google Calendar. Send SMS reminders to clients for upcoming appointments, reducing no-shows and improving service reliability.

- **Real-time Alerts for Developers**: Integrate 1msg with GitHub to send SMS notifications to developers when there's a new commit or pull request on important repositories, helping teams stay informed on code changes.
