# Overview

The SMS Partner API allows you to integrate SMS functionalities within your Pipedream workflows. This API gives you the power to send text messages, check delivery statuses, and manage contacts directly through programmatic means. By leveraging this API on Pipedream, you can automate notifications, streamline communication processes, and build complex messaging workflows that can interact with a plethora of other services available on Pipedream's platform.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support Notifications**: Create a workflow that listens for incoming support tickets via your preferred support platform (like Zendesk). When a new ticket is received, use the SMS Partner API to send a text message to the assigned support agent, ensuring they're promptly informed about the new issue.

- **Order Confirmation and Delivery Updates**: Connect an e-commerce platform like Shopify to your workflow. Trigger the workflow when a new order is placed or when an order's shipping status changes. Utilize the SMS Partner API to send the customer real-time updates via SMS on their order confirmation and delivery status.

- **Survey Distribution and Response Collection**: After a user interacts with your service, trigger a workflow that sends them a text message with a link to a feedback survey using the SMS Partner API. Collect responses with a tool like Google Forms and use Pipedream's processing capabilities to analyze the feedback data and act upon it, such as categorizing feedback or triggering follow-up actions.
