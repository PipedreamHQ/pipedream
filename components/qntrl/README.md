# Overview

The Qntrl API offers a powerful way to manage and automate your organization's workflows and processes directly within Pipedream. With this API, you can create, update, retrieve, and manage cards, orchestrate workflows, and synchronize data across different systems. Harness the power of Pipedream to integrate Qntrl with various apps and services, enabling seamless data flow and enhanced productivity.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Task Assignment**: Use Qntrl's API to create cards for new tasks and automatically assign them to team members based on predefined criteria. Trigger this workflow when a new row is added to a Google Sheets spreadsheet tracking task requests.

- **Workflow Progress Webhooks**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens to Qntrl webhook events to get real-time updates on card statuses. When a card moves to a certain stage, send a notification via Slack to the relevant team or team member.

- **Synchronized CRM Updates**: Whenever a deal progresses in Qntrl, use the API to update the corresponding record in Salesforce. This ensures your CRM reflects the most current status of each deal, maintaining a single source of truth.
