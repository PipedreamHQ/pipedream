# Overview

Apilio is an intelligent automation platform that enables the creation of complex logic for smart home and IoT devices. By leveraging the Apilio API on Pipedream, users can stitch together actions from various services and devices, making contextual decisions based on real-time data. This can involve using variables, conditions, and logicblocks within Apilio to execute actions that would otherwise require manual intervention or complex scripting.

# Example Use Cases

- **Temperature-Controlled Smart Home**: Trigger climate control devices like smart thermostats or fans when Apilio receives temperature data from IoT sensors via HTTP requests. For example, when the living room temperature exceeds 25Â°C, a Pipedream workflow could automatically instruct a smart thermostat to begin cooling the house.

- **Cost-Saving Energy Automation**: Automate your home's electricity usage by connecting Apilio to smart plugs and utility rate APIs. Create a workflow on Pipedream that turns off non-essential devices when electricity prices peak, or when your solar panels aren't producing enough power, optimizing for both cost and energy efficiency.

- **Smart Security Response**: Integrate motion sensors with smart lights and security cameras. When motion is detected in a specific area after dark, Apilio can prompt a Pipedream workflow to turn on the lights, begin recording on a camera, and send a notification to your phone, ensuring enhanced security and peace of mind.
