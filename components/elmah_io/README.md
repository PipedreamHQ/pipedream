# Overview

Elmah.io provides an API that allows developers to integrate their applications with the elmah.io service. This lets developers easily view and manage their application's error logs from one central location. Elmah.io also provides a number of features that are not available through the standard Elmah UI, such as filtering and searching of logs, custom dashboards, and integrations with a number of third-party services.
