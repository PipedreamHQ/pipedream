# Overview

The Iterate API, part of the Planview suite, is tailored for sophisticated task and project management, providing endpoints to manipulate boards, cards, and work items in LeanKit. Leveraging the Iterate API on Pipedream unlocks the potential for creating streamlined, serverless automations that can trigger actions across various platforms, react to changes in project status, and synchronize data between tools, all in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Project Status Notifications**: Send a Slack message when a card reaches a specific column on a LeanKit board, keeping your team instantly informed about project progress. This workflow can reduce project status meetings and ensure everyone is aligned.

- **Task Synchronization with External Systems**: Create or update tasks in external systems like Jira or Asana whenever a new card is created or modified in LeanKit. This keeps your project management synchronized across platforms, providing a consolidated view of all tasks.

- **Time Tracking Integration**: Start a timer in a time tracking tool like Toggl or Harvest when a card is moved to an 'In Progress' column on LeanKit. This workflow can automate time tracking and provide insights into the time spent on different project phases.
