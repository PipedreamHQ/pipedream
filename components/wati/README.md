# Overview

The WATI API allows you to power up your customer engagement by leveraging WhatsApp messaging. With Pipedream's capabilities, you can create serverless workflows that integrate WATI to automate personalized notifications, process inbound messages, and manage contacts. This can help scale your customer service, marketing campaigns, and streamline communications with WhatsApp's wide user base.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Automation**: Automate responses to common queries received on WhatsApp by using WATI with Pipedream's built-in code steps or pre-built actions. Tag and route complex issues to human agents or update your CRM with the conversation context.

- **Appointment Reminders**: Combine WATI with Google Calendar on Pipedream to send automated WhatsApp reminders for appointments. Trigger the workflow when a new event is added or an existing one is nearing its start time, reducing no-shows and enhancing customer experience.

- **Order Updates and Feedback Collection**: Use WATI with a Shopify trigger in Pipedream to notify customers of their order status. Follow up with a satisfaction survey through WhatsApp after order delivery, collecting feedback directly into a Google Sheet or your preferred analytics tool.
