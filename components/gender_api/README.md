# Overview

The Gender API is a simple, free API that allows you to determine the gender of
a first name. This is perfect for any application or website where you need to
know the gender of a person's name, such as for personalized content, targetted
advertising, or for sorting results.

Here are some examples of what you can build with the Gender API:

- A name directory that sorts names by gender
- A website that generates personalized content based on the user's gender
- A social networking site that groups users by gender
- An advertising platform that target ads based on gender
- A sorting tool that sorts names or results by gender
