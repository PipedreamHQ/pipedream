# Overview

The Benzinga API provides access to a suite of financial market data including stock quotes, news, and analysis that could be potent for traders, financial analysts, and apps needing real-time information. With Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform, you can build dynamic automations around this data. You might set up workflows that react to market changes, enrich CRM leads with financial insights, or automate news alerts for specific stock movements.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated News Digest for Portfolio Stocks**: Use Benzinga to fetch the latest news for a list of stocks in your portfolio and compile a daily digest email, automating this with Pipedream's built-in email service. Investors stay informed without manual news tracking.

- **Dynamic Financial Data Enrichment for CRM**: Connect Benzinga API with a CRM platform like Salesforce. Automatically update contact records with the latest financial data for companies associated with each lead, giving sales teams an edge with up-to-date information.
