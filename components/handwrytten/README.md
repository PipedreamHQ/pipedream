# Overview

The Handwrytten API allows you to automate the sending of handwritten notes to clients, customers, or friends. Integrating this API within Pipedream workflows enables you to create personalized outreach at scale, triggered by various business events such as customer signups, purchases, or feedback. It's an innovative way to add a human touch to your communication strategy through technology.

# Example Workflows

- **Customer Appreciation Notes**: After a customer makes a purchase, trigger a Pipedream workflow that uses the Handwrytten API to send a personalized thank you note. This can be paired with an e-commerce platform like Shopify to listen for new orders.

- **Birthday Wishes Automation**: Connect Handwrytten to a CRM like HubSpot through Pipedream. Whenever a contact's birthday is approaching, the workflow automatically generates and sends a handwritten birthday card, improving customer relations and personalization.

- **Event Follow-Up Messages**: After an event, use a workflow that integrates Handwrytten with event management apps like Eventbrite. Send out custom handwritten notes to attendees, thanking them for their participation and inviting them to future events.
