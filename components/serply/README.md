# Overview

The Serply API offers a way to automate SEO tasks by providing data about search engine results pages (SERPs). It enables you to retrieve search results, rankings, and related keywords, which can be essential for SEO analysis and content strategy. On Pipedream, you can leverage Serply to create powerful workflows that trigger on various events, process SERP data, and integrate with other services for a seamless automation experience.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Trend Monitoring**: Using Serply with Pipedream, you can monitor specific keywords for trends and changes in search engine results. Set up a scheduled workflow that fetches daily SERP data for targeted keywords and sends a summary report via email or Slack, keeping your content team in the loop.

- **Competitor SERP Position Tracking**: Create a workflow where Serply checks the SERP positions of your competitor's domains for key search terms. With this data, trigger actions like updating a Google Sheet for historical tracking or generating alerts if significant changes are detected.

- **Keyword Research and Expansion**: Pair Serply with a Pipedream workflow that analyzes your website's content to find new keyword opportunities. Use Serply to get suggestions based on current high-performing keywords and automatically add them to a content planning tool like Trello or Asana for review.
