# Overview

Klaxoon offers interactive tools for enhanced team collaboration and engagement. The Klaxoon API enables programmatic interactions, allowing you to create, manage, and track Klaxoon activities like quizzes, surveys, and brainstorming sessions. When integrated into Pipedream workflows, you can automate interactions with Klaxoon, sync data with other services, and tailor collaboration activities to your team's needs.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Feedback Collection**: Trigger a Klaxoon survey after a meeting event in Google Calendar. Use Pipedream to capture survey responses and automatically store them in a Google Sheet for analysis.

- **Dynamic Activity Creation**: Generate Klaxoon brainstorming sessions based on new Trello cards. When a card is added to a specific Trello board, a Pipedream workflow can create a corresponding Klaxoon activity, inviting relevant team members.

- **Real-time Notifications**: Send Slack notifications when a Klaxoon quiz is completed. Pipedream can listen for Klaxoon quiz submissions and post summaries or results to a designated Slack channel.
