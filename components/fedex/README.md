# Overview

The FedEx API provides a direct line to FedEx's shipping, tracking, and rate services, allowing you to automate the logistics within your business processes. Whether you're automating notifications based on shipment statuses, streamlining the creation of shipping labels, or integrating real-time shipping rates into your checkout process, this API offers a wealth of possibilities to enhance efficiency and customer satisfaction.

# Example Use Cases

- **Shipping Label Generation on Order Placement**: Automate the creation of shipping labels immediately after a customer places an order. When a new order is received in your eCommerce platform (like Shopify), Pipedream can trigger a workflow that utilizes the FedEx API to generate a shipping label and then email it to the customer or store it in a cloud storage service for easy access.

- **Real-time Shipment Tracking for Customer Support**: Build a system that provides real-time tracking updates to your support team. Link FedEx API with a CRM like Zendesk on Pipedream, so whenever a customer inquires about their order, the support team can instantly fetch the latest tracking information to provide timely and accurate updates.

- **Dynamic Shipping Rates at Checkout**: Integrate dynamic shipping rates into your website's checkout process. By connecting the FedEx API with your website backend through Pipedream, you can automatically calculate and display real-time shipping costs based on the customer's location and order size, ensuring transparency and preventing checkout abandonment.
