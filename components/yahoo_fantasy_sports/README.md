# Example Use Cases

**Fantasy Team Performance Tracker**
Automatically collect your fantasy team's performance data after each game. Aggregate and store this data in Google Sheets using Pipedream's Google Sheets integration. Analyze trends over time, making data-driven decisions to optimize your roster.

**Real-time Injury Alerts**
Set up a Pipedream workflow that monitors player statuses in real-time and sends a push notification via Twilio or Slack when a player on your fantasy team is listed as injured. This enables quick roster adjustments to avoid points loss.

**Automated Trade Proposals**
Create a workflow where Pipedream assesses player stats and performance metrics, then automatically generates and sends out trade proposals to other managers in your league via Gmail when it identifies a beneficial trade opportunity.
