# Overview

The MailGenius API helps examine your emails to ensure they don't get caught by spam filters. By calling this API through Pipedream, you can automate the process of testing and optimizing your email deliverability. This is crucial for email marketing campaigns, transactional emails, and any application where email delivery success is a must. With Pipedreamâ€™s capability to integrate various services, you can trigger workflows based on these insights to enhance your email strategies.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Email Optimization Workflow**: After a marketing team submits their email content via a Google Form, use Pipedream to send this content to the MailGenius API. Analyze the results, and if certain spam triggers are identified, automatically format the email content to reduce spam flags and resend it to the team for review.

- **Periodic Email Health Check**: Set up a recurring Pipedream workflow that sends test emails through the MailGenius API from your company's main email domains. Collect these insights and automatically generate reports using Google Sheets or send them via Slack to your IT or marketing team, ensuring ongoing optimization.

- **Transactional Email Trigger from E-commerce Platform**: Whenever a new order is placed on an e-commerce platform like Shopify, use Pipedream to trigger an email through your SMTP server. Before sending, pass the email content through the MailGenius API to check for any potential deliverability issues. Adjust if necessary and ensure high deliverability rates for critical transaction emails.
