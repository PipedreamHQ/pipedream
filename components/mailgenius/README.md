# Overview

The MailGenius API provides tools to analyze and optimize email deliverability. By using this API, you can perform detailed inspections on your email messages to identify potential issues that could prevent them from reaching recipients' inboxes. These diagnostics cover areas like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC settings, plus content analysis for spam triggers. Integrating MailGenius with Pipedream allows you to automate email audits, integrate results with other apps, and optimize communication strategies dynamically based on the insights.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Email Audit before Campaign Launch**: Before sending a large email campaign via a platform like SendGrid or Mailchimp, automatically send a test email through the MailGenius API on Pipedream. Analyze the report to ensure all settings are correct and the content is free of spam triggers, adjusting the campaign based on the feedback to maximize deliverability.

- **Real-time Alerting for Email Health Issues**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream that triggers every time you send an email through your regular provider, like Gmail or Outlook. Have MailGenius analyze the email, and if issues are detected (like failing SPF or DKIM), automatically send alerts to your team via Slack or email, prompting immediate corrective actions.

- **Scheduled Deliverability Reports for Compliance**: Create a monthly scheduled workflow on Pipedream that sends a batch of emails through the MailGenius API for deliverability testing. Collect these insights and compile them into a comprehensive report using Google Sheets or Data Studio. Share this report with your compliance and marketing teams to ensure ongoing adherence to best practices and regulations.
