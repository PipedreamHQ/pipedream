# Overview

Karbon is a work management platform designed for accounting firms, centralizing team communication, workflows, and client interactions. With Karbon's API, you can automate routine operations, sync data across multiple systems, and create custom monitoring solutions tailored for your firm's workflow. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can harness the power of Karbon's API to create dynamic, serverless workflows that connect Karbon with other apps to streamline your accounting practices.

# Example Use Cases

- **Task Automation from Email Requests**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow when an email is received in a specific mailbox. The workflow can parse the email for details, create a new task in Karbon, and assign it to the relevant team member. This workflow simplifies task creation, ensuring that client requests are promptly converted into actionable items.

- **Contact Sync with CRM**: Maintain synchronized contact information between Karbon and a CRM like Salesforce. Whenever a contact is updated in Karbon, the workflow triggers, updating the corresponding entry in Salesforce. This ensures that all team members have access to the most up-to-date client information across all platforms.

- **Daily Workload Digest**: Generate a daily digest of tasks and priorities for each team member using the Karbon API. The workflow aggregates the day's tasks from Karbon, formats them into a readable report, and sends it via Slack or email. This helps team members start their day with a clear picture of their priorities.
