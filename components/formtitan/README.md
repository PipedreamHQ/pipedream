# Overview

The FormTitan API enables interaction with FormTitan's form-building and lead-capture capabilities programmatically. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to automate form data processing, synchronize data across various platforms, and trigger actions based on form submissions. This can streamline complex workflow scenarios, such as lead nurturing, survey data analysis, and customer feedback management, without the need to manually intervene.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Lead Capture to CRM**: Upon receiving a new form submission in FormTitan, trigger a Pipedream workflow to parse the submission and create a new lead in your CRM, like Salesforce or HubSpot. This ensures that your sales team always has the latest leads to work with, without any manual entry.

- **Dynamic Survey Analysis**: When a new survey is completed via FormTitan, use Pipedream to send the data to Google Sheets for storage. Then, trigger additional workflows that utilize Google Data Studio for real-time survey analysis, helping you to quickly glean insights and make data-driven decisions.

- **Customer Feedback Loop**: Create a Pipedream workflow that listens for new feedback submissions via FormTitan. Once a submission is detected, automatically create a ticket in a customer service platform such as Zendesk, and send a personalized thank you email from SendGrid to the customer, acknowledging their input and closing the feedback loop efficiently.
