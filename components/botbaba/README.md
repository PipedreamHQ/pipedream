# Overview

Botbaba is a powerful chatbot platform that enables the creation of interactive chatbots for various purposes, from customer support to lead generation. With the Botbaba API, you can extend the capabilities of your bots by integrating them with a myriad of services and automations via Pipedream. This connection allows you to trigger workflows from chatbot interactions, synchronize data with CRMs, send notifications, process orders, and more, effectively turning chat conversations into actionable business insights and tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Ticket Creation**: When a user interacts with your Botbaba chatbot and requests assistance, you can set up a Pipedream workflow to automatically create a ticket in a customer support platform like Zendesk. This ensures that no customer query goes unnoticed and helps your support team track and manage requests efficiently.

- **Lead Qualification and CRM Integration**: Upon capturing a lead through Botbaba, use Pipedream to qualify this lead based on predefined criteria. If the lead is qualified, automatically add their details to a CRM like Salesforce, and even assign them to the appropriate sales rep, streamlining the lead management process.

- **E-commerce Order Processing**: For e-commerce chatbots built with Botbaba, integrate a Pipedream workflow that processes orders right from the chat. Connect with payment gateways, update inventory systems like Shopify, and send order confirmations to customers, all in real-time, creating a seamless buying experience.
