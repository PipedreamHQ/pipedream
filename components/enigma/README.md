# Overview

The Enigma API offers access to a vast repository of global public data, which can be harnessed to enrich business intelligence, enhance analytics, and automate due diligence processes. By tapping into Enigma's curated datasets on Pipedream, you can seamlessly integrate real-time insights into your applications or workflows, perform comprehensive data analysis, and cross-reference multiple sources to uncover critical information on businesses, markets, and economies.

# Example Use Cases

- **Risk Assessment Automation**: Configure a Pipedream workflow to periodically pull company data from Enigma and assess the risk profile of potential clients or partners. This data can be cross-referenced with your internal risk parameters and automatically notify the compliance team if red flags are detected.

- **Market Research and Analysis**: Set up a Pipedream pipeline that fetches industry-related datasets from Enigma on a scheduled basis. Integrate this data with a BI tool like Tableau (also available on Pipedream) to create dynamic, data-driven market analysis dashboards that update in real time.

- **Enhanced Due Diligence Process**: Create a Pipedream workflow that uses Enigma to perform background checks on companies. The workflow can populate CRM systems like Salesforce with enriched company data, providing sales teams with up-to-date intelligence for more informed engagement strategies.
