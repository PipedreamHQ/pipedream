# Overview

Linkish is a versatile API that enhances the way you handle web links. It allows you to organize, preview, and optimize web links with features such as URL shortening, web page metadata retrieval, and link previews with screenshots. With Pipedream, you can create powerful automations by connecting Linkish to other services to streamline content sharing, web research, and digital marketing workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Sharing Automation**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever you publish a new blog post or article. Use Linkish to shorten the URL and fetch metadata, then automatically distribute the link with a preview and description to multiple social media platforms using apps like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.

- **Digital Marketing Campaign Tracking**: Set up a workflow that creates shortened links with Linkish for different marketing campaigns. Integrate with Google Sheets to log each unique link along with campaign details. Use Pipedream to track link clicks by connecting to analytics services and update the corresponding Google Sheets rows with real-time performance data.

- **Research & Data Collection**: Organize a workflow where, upon adding a new URL to a designated project management tool like Trello or Asana, Pipedream triggers Linkish to retrieve the metadata and screenshot of the page. Store the collected data in a centralized database or spreadsheet for a visual and structured research library.
