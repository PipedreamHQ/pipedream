# Overview

The Gatekeeper API empowers users to streamline vendor and contract management through its robust suite of features on Pipedream. With this API, you can automate processes like vendor approvals, contract renewals, and compliance checks. By integrating Gatekeeper with other apps on Pipedream, you get the power to create custom, automated workflows that can save time, reduce human error, and ensure timely actions on vendor-related activities.

# Example Use Cases

- **Vendor Onboarding Automation**: Automate the vendor onboarding process by using the Gatekeeper API to create new vendor records when a form is submitted through Google Forms. Set up a workflow that triggers upon form submission, creates the vendor in Gatekeeper, and sends a welcome email to the vendor using SendGrid.

- **Contract Renewal Reminders**: Use the Gatekeeper API to monitor contract end dates and set up a Pipedream workflow that sends Slack notifications to the responsible team members 30 days before a contract is due to expire. This ensures that renewals are handled proactively, without missing any critical deadlines.

- **Compliance Audit Trails**: Build a workflow that leverages the Gatekeeper API to periodically fetch reports on vendor compliance status. Integrate this with a data visualization tool like Google Data Studio to represent compliance levels across vendors, making it easier to identify areas of risk and take corrective action.
