# Overview

Eden AI provides a simple API for integrating a variety of AI services from different providers. On Pipedream, you can leverage Eden AI to automate tasks that involve natural language processing, computer vision, and other AI capabilities. By connecting Eden AI with other apps, you can create powerful workflows for data enrichment, content moderation, or sentiment analysis without extensive AI expertise.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Moderation**: Use Eden AI to analyze user-generated content in real-time. When a new post is submitted to a platform like Reddit, trigger a Pipedream workflow that uses Eden AI to check for inappropriate content. If such content is detected, automatically flag the post and notify moderators.

- **Sentiment Analysis for Customer Feedback**: Collect customer feedback via a form submission app like Typeform. When a new submission comes in, a Pipedream workflow can send the feedback to Eden AI for sentiment analysis. Based on the results, categorize the feedback as positive, negative, or neutral, and route it to the appropriate team or CRM like Salesforce.

- **Image Recognition for Social Media**: With Eden AI, you can set up a workflow on Pipedream that monitors social media platforms like Twitter for brand mentions with images. When a new mention is found, analyze the image for logos or products using Eden AI's image recognition. Use this data to track brand presence or to engage with users posting about your brand.
