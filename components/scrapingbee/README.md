# Overview

The ScrapingBee API lets you extract data from web pages programmatically. It handles headless browsers and rotating proxies, so you can focus on data extraction without worrying about common web scraping issues like getting blocked. On Pipedream, you can tap into ScrapingBee's capability to create serverless workflows that scrape web data and connect them with numerous services for processing, storing, or triggering actions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Aggregation**: Build a workflow that uses ScrapingBee to scrape news articles or blog posts from various sites daily. Combine it with Pipedream's built-in cron scheduler to automate the process. The extracted data can be sent to apps like Google Sheets for organization and analysis, or used to update content on your website via CMS API.

- **E-commerce Price Monitoring**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that employs ScrapingBee to regularly check product prices on competitor websites. Use this data to adjust your pricing strategy dynamically. You could connect this workflow to Slack or email, to notify your team whenever there's a significant price change detected.

- **SEO Backlink Verification**: Leverage ScrapingBee with Pipedream to verify the presence of backlinks on external websites. This can be part of a broader SEO monitoring strategy, ensuring that your backlink profile remains strong. For found backlinks, update a database through a service like Airtable or send a summary report to a communication platform such as Discord to keep the SEO team informed.
