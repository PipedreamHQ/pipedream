# Overview

The Coinranking API provides real-time access to cryptocurrency data such as prices, market caps, and coin information. This powerful data stream, when harnessed through Pipedream, can automate tasks, generate alerts, and integrate with a plethora of other apps to analyze trends, sync data across platforms, or kick off workflows based on crypto market movements. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can build complex automations without managing infrastructure, allowing you to focus on strategy and analysis.

# Example Use Cases

- **Price Alert System**: Create a Pipedream workflow that monitors cryptocurrency prices using Coinranking API. Trigger actions, like sending an email via SendGrid or a direct message on Slack, when your target crypto hits a certain price, ensuring you never miss an investment opportunity.

- **Portfolio Tracker**: Build a serverless function on Pipedream that periodically checks your cryptocurrency portfolio's value by fetching current prices from the Coinranking API. You could log this data to a Google Sheet to track historical performance or use a chart API to visualize your portfolio growth over time.

- **Automated Trading**: Leverage Pipedream's capabilities with the Coinranking API to implement a simple trading bot. Set criteria for buying or selling cryptocurrencies and use integrations with exchange APIs to execute trades automatically when certain conditions, like specific price points or trends, are met.
