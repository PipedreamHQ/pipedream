# Overview

Quipu is an API designed to simplify invoicing and accounting for freelancers and small businesses. By integrating Quipu with Pipedream, you unlock the potential of automating financial tasks, syncing data across platforms, and streamlining invoicing operations. Pipedream's serverless platform provides the flexibility to connect Quipu with a myriad of other apps and services, enabling you to craft custom workflows that fit your exact business needs. Whether it's triggering actions based on invoice statuses, syncing contacts between platforms, or generating financial reports, Quipu's API and Pipedream's orchestration can together build a robust financial automation system.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Creation and Delivery**: When a new sale is registered in your e-commerce platform (like Shopify), Pipedream triggers a Quipu workflow that generates an invoice and sends it to the customer. This ensures timely billing without manual intervention.

- **Expense Tracking and Reporting**: Capture expenses from a company credit card or a platform like Expensify into Quipu. Set up a Pipedream workflow to automatically add these transactions as expenses in Quipu, categorize them, and generate monthly expense reports for easy reconciliation.

- **Sync Contacts Between CRM and Quipu**: Whenever a new contact is added to your CRM (like Salesforce), a Pipedream workflow is triggered to create or update the contact details in Quipu. This keeps your invoicing system in sync with your customer relationship management, saving time and reducing errors.
