# Overview
AltTextify offers an AI-powered API that automatically generates alternative text (alt text) for images—playing a critical role in improving website accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).

# Example Use Cases
- **Effortless Alt Text for E-commerce Products**: Streamline your product content strategy with AltTextify. When a new image is uploaded to a Dropbox folder, Pipedream triggers a workflow that sends the image to AltTextify. The generated, SEO-friendly alt text is then automatically applied to the product in Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento or any other e-commerce platform—no manual tagging required.

- **Smarter Blog Accessibility with Every Draft**: Ensure your blog posts are not just compelling—but compliant. As soon as a draft is created in WordPress, Pipedream can route embedded images to AltTextify. Within seconds, alt text is returned and added to the post, enhancing accessibility and aligning with ADA and WCAG standards before publication.

- **AI-Assisted CMS Migration**: Migrating content from an old CMS (e.g., Joomla) to a new one (like WordPress or Strapi)? During migration, use Pipedream to detect missing or outdated image alt text. Send image URLs to AltTextify for automated generation and update metadata before importing—ensuring accessibility and SEO hygiene from day one.

- **Alt Text Auditing & Enrichment**: Review and enrich existing image alt text across a large media library.Use Pipedream to crawl your existing CMS or S3 bucket, compare stored alt text, and pass low-quality or empty alt attributes to AltTextify for enhancement. Ideal for large publishers or digital libraries.

- **Automated SEO optimizations for Static Sites**: Give your GitHub Pages site an organic search edge. On every new commit, Pipedream detects image changes, routes them through AltTextify, and injects relevant, keyword-optimized alt text into your HTML or Markdown. It's a hands-free upgrade to your site's SEO and accessibility—baked right into your development workflow.
