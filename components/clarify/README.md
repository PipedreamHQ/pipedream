# Overview

The Clarify API specializes in making data from business apps accessible and actionable. It extracts data from various sources like emails, documents, and other apps, then organizes this data to be easily integrated into business workflows. With Clarify and Pipedream, you can automate data extraction and processing tasks, streamlining the way businesses handle information across multiple platforms. This integration can significantly enhance productivity by automating repetitive tasks, providing timely insights, and connecting data seamlessly across apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Extraction from Incoming Emails**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream where incoming emails (via Gmail or another email service supported by Pipedream) trigger a function that uses the Clarify API to extract relevant data from attachments or the email body. This data can then be automatically sent to a CRM like Salesforce or a database for further processing.

- **Document Processing for HR Onboarding**: Automate the extraction of data from documents uploaded by new employees during the onboarding process. Use the Clarify API to parse resumes, tax forms, or identification documents, and input this data directly into HR management systems like BambooHR or Workday, reducing manual data entry and speeding up the onboarding process.

- **Real-Time Customer Data Aggregation**: Trigger a workflow when a new transaction occurs on platforms like Shopify or Stripe. Use the Clarify API to extract transaction details and customer information, then aggregate this data in a customer relationship management tool or a custom dashboard. This approach helps in maintaining up-to-date customer profiles, aiding in personalized marketing and customer service.
