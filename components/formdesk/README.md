# Overview

Formdesk is a versatile tool that lets you create online forms, surveys, and quizzes. With the Formdesk API on Pipedream, you can automate data collection, analysis, and integration. Whether you're syncing form submissions to a database, triggering emails based on responses, or connecting Formdesk to other apps for seamless data flow, Pipedream’s serverless platform empowers you to build powerful, customized workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Survey Response Collector**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow with each new Formdesk submission. Collect responses, analyze them in real-time, and automatically store them in a Google Sheets document for easy sharing and collaboration.

- **Conditional Email Notifications**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that evaluates submissions for specific criteria—like a low satisfaction score—and sends a tailored email via SendGrid to address issues proactively, enhancing customer follow-ups.

- **Integrated CRM Updates**: When a new form submission comes through Formdesk, use a Pipedream workflow to parse the data and update contacts or leads in Salesforce, ensuring your sales team always has the latest information at their fingertips.
