# Overview

The Telnyx API offers a suite of telecommunication features enabling developers to manage voice, SMS, and other real-time communications. With Telnyx, you can programmatically send and receive text messages, handle voice calls, and control other telephony services using their robust API. Leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, this API can be hooked into workflows to automate complex tasks, react to incoming messages or calls, and integrate with countless other services for analytics, customer support, and more.

# Example Use Cases

- **SMS Customer Support**: Automate responses to customer inquiries via SMS by integrating Telnyx with a customer support app like Zendesk. When an SMS is received, trigger a Pipedream workflow to create or update a ticket in Zendesk, ensuring customer issues are tracked and resolved efficiently.

- **Voice Call Analytics**: Capture call data from Telnyx for analysis. Each time a call is made or received, use Pipedream to log details into a Google Sheets spreadsheet or a database for real-time analytics, helping you to understand call volume, duration, and geographic distribution of your users.

- **Automated Notifications System**: Create a system that sends out SMS or voice call notifications through Telnyx based on triggers from a project management tool like Trello. Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for specific status updates or tagged tasks in Trello, and then automatically sends out alerts to relevant stakeholders, keeping everyone informed with the latest project updates.
