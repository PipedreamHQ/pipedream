# Overview

GoDial turns your phone into a call center, enabling businesses to manage calls and contacts efficiently. The API provides programmatic access to this functionality, allowing you to trigger calls, manage contacts, and automate call logging. With Pipedream, you can harness GoDial's capabilities to create workflows that connect call activities with CRM platforms, customer support tickets, and notification systems, streamlining communication processes within your business.

# Example Use Cases

- **CRM Integration for Customer Follow-Up**: Automate the creation of follow-up tasks in a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot when a call ends in GoDial. Using Pipedream, you can capture call details, check the call outcome, and create a task in the CRM for sales agents to execute tailored follow-up actions based on the call's result.

- **Support Ticket Creation**: Instantly generate support tickets in tools like Zendesk or Jira when a call is identified as a support query in GoDial. Pipedream can take the call data, classify the type of support needed, and open a new ticket with all relevant details, ensuring that customer issues are addressed promptly and efficiently.

- **Real-Time Notifications for Missed Calls**: Set up a workflow that sends real-time alerts via Slack or email when a call is missed in GoDial. With Pipedream, you can monitor missed call events, filter based on importance or client, and dispatch notifications to the responsible team members to enable quick call-backs and minimize customer wait times.
