# Example Use Cases

- **Sync LiveChat Conversations to Google Sheets**: Automatically archive every conversation from LiveChat into a Google Sheets document. This workflow can help with record-keeping, data analysis, and reporting, ensuring that every interaction is logged and can be reviewed or mined for insights at a later time.

- **Customer Support Ticket Creation**: Create a workflow that listens for specific keywords or phrases in a LiveChat conversation and uses this to trigger the creation of a support ticket in a system like Jira or Zendesk. This can help streamline the process of escalating issues and ensuring that customer inquiries don't go unnoticed.

- **CRM Integration**: Sync LiveChat conversations and customer data with a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. You can set up a workflow where new chats automatically create or update customer profiles, keeping your customer information current and making sure that your team has access to the most relevant data during their conversations.
