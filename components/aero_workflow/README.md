# Overview

You can use the Aero Workflow API to build from simpleETL processes to
multi-step workflows that encompass a variety of microservices. The following
are examples of what you can build using the Aero Workflow API:

- A process that ingests data from a remote data source, transforms it, and
  then stores it in a database.
- A workflow that aggregates data from multiple data sources, runs some
  analysis on it, and then produces a report.
- A process that monitors a data source for new data, ingests it, and then
  sends it to a message queue for processing by other elements of your system.
