# Overview

The Aero Workflow API enables the automation of task management and workflow optimization for professional service firms. Using Pipedream, you can harness this API to create powerful automations that streamline the tasks and procedures within your business. This can significantly reduce manual input, error rates, and increase overall efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Client Onboarding**: Trigger a workflow in Aero Workflow whenever a new client is added in your CRM, like Salesforce. The workflow can automatically create a series of tasks tailored to onboarding that particular client, such as sending welcome emails, setting up accounts, and scheduling initial meetings.

- **Project Management Enhancement**: Connect Aero Workflow with project management tools like Trello or Asana. When a certain phase of a project is completed, a trigger can initiate a series of follow-up tasks in Aero Workflow, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks and keeping all team members aligned and aware of next steps.

- **Invoice and Payment Processing**: Integrate Aero Workflow with accounting software like QuickBooks. When work is marked as completed in Aero Workflow, the API can trigger an invoice creation in QuickBooks, and upon payment receipt, a corresponding task in Aero Workflow can be marked as settled, keeping finances and task statuses in sync.
