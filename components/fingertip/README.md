# Overview

The Fingertip API allows users to access features from the Fingertip decision-making platform, making it simpler to manage decisions, plans, and tasks in a structured manner. With this API integrated into Pipedream, you can automate workflows to sync decision data across various platforms, trigger actions based on decision outcomes, and streamline communication and project tracking processes. The APIâ€™s capabilities enable users to programmatically interact with decision logs, status updates, and action items, enhancing team collaboration and productivity.

# Example Use Cases

- **Decision Notification System**: Create a workflow where any new decision made within the Fingertip platform triggers an immediate notification on Slack. This keeps the whole team instantly informed and can prompt quick feedback or necessary actions.

- **Project Management Sync**: Automate a workflow to sync decisions and tasks from Fingertip to a Trello board. Each decision or updated task status in Fingertip can generate a corresponding Trello card, ensuring project management tools stay updated with the latest developments without manual data entry.

- **Meeting Summaries with Email Integration**: After every major decision session recorded in Fingertip, set up a workflow that compiles the decisions made, the rationale, and any assigned tasks, then emails this summary to all stakeholders. Use SendGrid or a similar email service on Pipedream for efficient implementation.
