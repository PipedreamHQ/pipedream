# Overview

The Wise API enables seamless integration of international bank transfers into applications, offering real-time currency exchange rates, multi-currency account management, and compliance checks. With Pipedream, you can leverage Wise to automate financial workflows, sync transaction data with accounting software, and trigger actions based on payment events, all while maintaining security and reducing the manual overhead often involved in international finances.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Payments**: Set up a workflow where invoices from your accounting platform (like QuickBooks) trigger international payments through Wise. When an invoice is marked as due, Pipedream can automatically initiate a payment in the required currency, streamlining your accounts payable process.

- **Real-time Currency Exchange Alerts**: Create a Pipedream workflow that monitors currency exchange rates between your preferred currency pairs on Wise. When the exchange rate hits a specified threshold, the workflow could notify you via email or a messaging app like Slack, enabling timely financial decisions.

- **Synchronized Financial Reporting**: Integrate Wise with a data visualization tool like Google Data Studio. Each time a new transaction occurs, Pipedream can extract the transaction details and feed them into a live report, giving you up-to-date insight into your financial status across different currencies and countries.
