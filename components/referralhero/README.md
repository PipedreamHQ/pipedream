# Overview

The ReferralHero API allows you to build custom referral marketing campaigns, manage participants, and track referral performance directly from Pipedream. You can automate participant registration, reward distribution, and integrate with other services for enhanced functionality like email marketing, CRM updates, or analytics. By leveraging Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform, you can create workflows that react to events in ReferralHero, enrich referral data, or synchronize it with other apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Referrals to Google Sheets**: When a new referral signs up, automatically add their details to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This workflow can help maintain an up-to-date list for tracking and further analysis.

- **Send Welcome Emails via SendGrid**: Automatically send personalized welcome emails using SendGrid to new participants who join your referral program. This can improve engagement and provide immediate confirmation upon registration.

- **Update CRM with Referral Status**: On a successful referral, trigger a workflow to update the referrer's status in a CRM like Salesforce. This ensures your sales team has the latest information on customer referrals for follow-up.
