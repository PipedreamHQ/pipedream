# Overview

Linqs API provides a gateway to create and manage smart, digital business cards that can be shared effortlessly. With Linqs and Pipedream, you can build automation that streamlines networking and data collection. Automate the creation of digital cards for new employees, sync contact information with CRM platforms, or trigger custom actions when someone scans a cardâ€”options are diverse and tailored for modern, seamless connection-building.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Digital Card Creation for New Employees**: When a new employee is added to your HR system (like BambooHR), trigger a Pipedream workflow that automatically creates a Linqs digital business card for them. The card's details can then be sent to the employee via email using an app like SendGrid, making onboarding smooth and tech-savvy.

- **CRM Integration and Contact Syncing**: Sync scanned Linqs card details to a CRM (such as Salesforce) using Pipedream. Each time a card is scanned, the workflow is triggered, creating or updating the contact's information in your CRM, ensuring your sales team always has up-to-date leads and contact data.

- **Custom Notifications for Card Interactions**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that sends custom notifications via apps like Slack or Twilio whenever someone scans a Linqs card. This workflow could notify a sales rep instantly when a prospective client scans their card, enabling immediate follow-up and enhancing engagement opportunities.
