# Overview

The Newsman API lets you automate and integrate email marketing efforts with ease. You can manage subscribers, send campaigns, and analyze your email marketing performance directly within Pipedream. This API is a gateway to create workflows that engage your audience, segment lists, and track results, combining the power of email marketing with other tools to create rich, automated tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Subscriber Sync Workflow**: Automatically sync new subscribers from your CRM, like Salesforce, to your Newsman subscriber lists. When a new contact is added to Salesforce, Pipedream triggers a workflow that adds the contact to a specified Newsman list, ensuring your audience is always up-to-date.

- **Campaign Trigger Workflow**: Launch a Newsman email campaign based on customer behavior tracked in an e-commerce platform like Shopify. For instance, if a customer makes a purchase, Pipedream can kick off a workflow that sends a thank-you email or a series of follow-up emails via Newsman to keep engagement high.

- **Performance Metrics Workflow**: Collect and analyze your Newsman campaign metrics by sending data to Google Sheets. After an email campaign is sent, use Pipedream to retrieve the campaign performance data from Newsman and log it in a spreadsheet, allowing for easy tracking and visualization of your marketing efforts.
