# Overview

The OnlineCheckWriter API enables the automation of check writing and mailing processes, providing a seamless integration for managing financial transactions digitally. With this API, you can create checks, manage bank accounts, and even organize payees. This functionality is particularly useful when combined with Pipedream's capabilities, which allow you to trigger workflows from a variety of events, and integrate with numerous other apps to create comprehensive financial management solutions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing and Check Mailing**: When a client invoice is marked as "Paid" in an accounting app like QuickBooks, trigger a Pipedream workflow that automatically generates and mails a check using OnlineCheckWriter. This reduces manual effort and ensures timely payments.

- **Subscription Fee Collection**: Set up a workflow where, on a recurring basis, subscription fees are collected via payment gateways like Stripe. Upon successful payment confirmation, use OnlineCheckWriter to issue a receipt or check that acknowledges the payment, enhancing record-keeping and customer trust.

- **Financial Reconciliation Notifications**: Create a workflow that monitors transactions in OnlineCheckWriter. When discrepancies are detected between logged transactions and bank statements (pulled from a banking API like Plaid), automatically send alert notifications to finance teams via communication platforms like Slack or email for immediate review and action.
