# Overview

The Woovi API provides capabilities to interact with Woovi's video streaming services. In Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate workflows related to video content management, distribution, and analytics. Custom integrations can help you streamline operations, such as automating video uploads, syncing metadata, or triggering actions based on viewer data.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Video Uploads**: Build a workflow where videos are automatically uploaded to Woovi from a cloud storage provider like Dropbox or Google Drive. Once a new video is detected in a specified folder, Pipedream can handle the upload to Woovi, saving you time and minimizing manual intervention.

- **Content Metadata Sync**: Maintain consistent metadata across platforms by creating a workflow that syncs metadata from your CMS to Woovi. Whenever content is updated in your CMS, Pipedream can trigger an update to ensure that video titles, descriptions, and tags are mirrored on Woovi.

- **Viewer Analytics Trigger**: Use Pipedream to set up a workflow that listens for new viewer analytics from Woovi and triggers actions based on that data. For example, if a video reaches a certain view count, you could automatically send an email alert or post a congratulatory message on social media.
