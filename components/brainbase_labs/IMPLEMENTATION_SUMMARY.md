## Authentication

**Type**: API Key Authentication

- **Header**: `x-api-key`
- **Base URL**: `https://brainbase-monorepo-api.onrender.com`

## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Prop Definitions**: All actions use dynamic prop definitions that fetch available options from the API (workers, flows, deployments, etc.)

2. **Consistent Error Handling**: All HTTP methods use the centralized `_makeRequest` method with proper error handling

3. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each action includes:

   - Clear description
   - Input parameter definitions
   - Type validation
   - Optional/required field specifications

4. **RESTful API Methods**: Implements GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE methods

5. **Pagination Support**: Voice deployment logs support pagination with page and limit parameters

## Testing Results

All tests passed successfully:

- ✅ App structure validation
- ✅ Method existence checks (34 methods)
- ✅ URL construction
- ✅ Headers construction
- ✅ Action file existence (26 actions)
- ✅ Action structure validation

const worker = await steps.create_worker.$return_value;

// 2. Create Flow
const flow = await steps.create_flow.$return_value;

// 3. Create Voice Deployment
const deployment = await steps.create_voice_deployment.$return_value;

await steps.make_batch_calls.$return_value;
```

## Next Steps

To use this component in production:

1. **Register with Pipedream**: Submit the component to Pipedream's registry
2. **Add API Key**: Configure authentication in Pipedream with your Brainbase API key
3. **Test with Real API**: Run actions against the actual Brainbase API
4. **Create Workflows**: Build automated workflows using the available actions
