# Brainbase

Brainbase is a platform for building and deploying AI voice agents. Create intelligent workers that can handle phone calls, automate customer interactions, and integrate with your existing communication infrastructure.

## What You Can Do

With the Brainbase integration on Pipedream, you can:

- **Automate Voice Agent Deployments** - Programmatically create and configure AI voice agents that can make or receive phone calls
- **Monitor Call Activity** - Track voice deployment logs, analyze sentiment, and retrieve call records for quality assurance
- **Manage Phone Numbers** - Register and configure phone numbers for your voice agents through Twilio integration
- **Build Dynamic Workflows** - Create AI workers with custom flows that adapt based on triggers from other apps in your Pipedream workflows
- **Scale Communications** - Make batch calls to multiple recipients with personalized AI interactions

## Use Cases

### Customer Support Automation

Automatically deploy voice agents when support tickets are created in Zendesk or when specific keywords are detected in emails. Route calls based on customer data and log interactions back to your CRM.

### Appointment Reminders

Trigger AI voice calls to remind customers of upcoming appointments when calendar events approach. Collect confirmations and automatically update your scheduling system.

### Lead Qualification

Deploy voice agents to call leads from your sales pipeline, ask qualification questions, and route hot leads to human sales reps based on responses and sentiment analysis.

### Outbound Notifications

Send voice notifications for order updates, delivery alerts, or account changes by triggering calls when status changes occur in your e-commerce or SaaS platform.
