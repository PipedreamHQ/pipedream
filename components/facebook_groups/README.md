# Getting Started
You need to install the Pipedream app in your Facebook Group in order to make any API calls, or use any prebuilt triggers or actions. To install Pipedream, navigate to the group where you're an administrator, and in the left sidebar, under **Settings** > **Group Settings**, you'll find **Manage Advanced Settings**. Click the Edit button under **Apps**.
