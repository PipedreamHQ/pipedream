# Overview

InsertChat API lets you seamlessly integrate a robust chat solution into your applications, enabling real-time communication among users. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to create dynamic, serverless workflows that trigger actions in other apps based on chat events, automate responses, and synchronize chat data with other services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Automation**: Automatically initiate a chat session in InsertChat when a customer submits a support ticket via a platform like Zendesk. Use Pipedream to watch for new Zendesk tickets, trigger an InsertChat session, and notify the support team.

- **Feedback Collection**: After a webinar, automatically send participants a chat message via InsertChat asking for feedback. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers at the end of a webinar hosted on platforms like Zoom, connects with InsertChat, and sends a pre-defined message soliciting feedback.

- **Real-time Notifications for E-commerce**: Send real-time chat notifications to customers about their order status changes using InsertChat. Build a Pipedream workflow that listens to webhook events from an e-commerce platform like Shopify whenever an order status is updated, and then use InsertChat to inform the customer.
