# Overview

The Liondesk API enables you to automate and integrate your CRM tasks, streamlining your customer relationship workflows. With this API on Pipedream, you can craft workflows that trigger actions based on events, manage contacts, send messages, and much more. Pipedream's serverless platform simplifies the process, allowing you to connect Liondesk with 3,000+ other apps to automate complex tasks without writing extensive code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Contacts to Google Sheets**: When a new contact is added to Liondesk, automatically add their details to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This is perfect for backing up contacts or for further data analysis and sharing with team members who prefer to work within Google Sheets.

- **Distribute Leads to Slack Channels**: Distribute incoming Liondesk leads to specific Slack channels. For instance, based on the lead's interest, a workflow can auto-post their info to a "Homes for Sale" or "Rentals" Slack channel, ensuring the right team follows up promptly.

- **Automate Email Follow-Ups**: Set up a workflow that auto-sends personalized follow-up emails via Liondesk when a contact reaches a certain stage in your pipeline or after a set period without engagement. This helps maintain consistent communication without manual intervention.
