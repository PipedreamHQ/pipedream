# Overview

The Zoho Meeting API lets you automate various aspects of managing online meetings and webinars. You can create, update, or cancel sessions, list all your meetings, fetch details of specific meetings, and more. Integrating the Zoho Meeting API with Pipedream enables you to connect your meeting management flow with other apps and services, streamlining your workflow and automating repetitive tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Meeting Creation and Notifications**: Create meetings automatically in Zoho Meeting based on triggers from other apps, such as new event bookings in Calendly. Then use Pipedream to send custom email invites or Slack messages to the participants with the meeting details.

- **Sync Meetings with Google Calendar**: Whenever a new meeting is scheduled in Zoho Meeting, use Pipedream to create a corresponding event in Google Calendar, and vice versa, ensuring your schedule is always up-to-date across platforms.

- **Meeting Insights with Data Processing**: After a meeting ends, use Pipedream to fetch the meeting details and attendance report from Zoho Meeting. Process this data to gain insights or update CRM records in Salesforce, and finally, store the processed data in a Google Sheets document for record-keeping and further analysis.
