# Overview

The Bash API in Pipedream allows you to run Bash scripts within the Pipedream serverless execution environment, enabling you to perform tasks on the fly without provisioning your own servers. You can integrate Bash scripts with various APIs, services, and Pipedream's built-in triggers and actions to automate workflows. It's great for quick data processing, file operations, and leveraging command-line tools directly within your workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Scheduled System Cleanup**: Automate the cleanup of temporary files on a scheduled basis using cron triggers within Pipedream. You can write a Bash script that finds and removes files older than a certain threshold.

- **Process Webhook Data**: When a webhook is received, use a Bash script to process the data. For instance, if you receive JSON data, you could parse it using `jq` and transform it before sending it to another service like Google Sheets.

- **Image Processing Workflow**: After an image is uploaded to an S3 bucket, trigger a Pipedream workflow that uses a Bash script to manipulate the image using command-line tools like ImageMagick, then upload the processed image back to S3 or another storage service.
