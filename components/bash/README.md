# Overview

The Bash API on Pipedream enables you to run Bash scripts directly within your workflows, offering a powerful way to automate tasks that require shell scripting or command-line tools. By leveraging Bash, you can manipulate data, manage system tasks, and integrate with various system-level applications, all within the context of a serverless platform. This capability is particularly useful for tasks like file manipulation, system reporting, and executing complex workflows that combine multiple command-line tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **System Cleanup and File Management**: Automate the cleanup of temporary files or logs and manage file backups. You can set up a workflow that triggers on a schedule (e.g., daily or weekly) to delete old logs and backup important data to a cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox.

- **Data Processing and Manipulation**: Use Bash to perform text processing tasks such as parsing, cutting, sorting, and unique filtering of data files. For instance, you might download data from an API, process the data using Bash scripts, and then upload the results to a database or send it via email.

- **Health Check and Monitoring**: Implement system health checks and send notifications based on the output. A Pipedream workflow could periodically run diagnostic commands (like `ping` or `curl`) to check the status of a website or API, parse the output, and send alerts (via Slack or email) if something goes wrong.
