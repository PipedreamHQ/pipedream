# Overview

The Bash API on Pipedream allows users to execute Bash scripts directly within Pipedream workflows. This integration opens up a plethora of automation possibilities, particularly for tasks related to system administration, file manipulation, and data processing. With Bash, you can implement complex logic that might be cumbersome in other languages, directly interact with the system, and use typical Unix command-line tools. By combining Bash with other Pipedream supported apps, users can create powerful, automated workflows that respond to various triggers and handle data across platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **System Health Checks and Notifications**: Automate system health checks by writing a Bash script that examines server metrics like CPU usage, disk space, and memory usage. Integrate with Slack API on Pipedream to send real-time alerts if certain thresholds are exceeded, ensuring timely response to potential system issues.

- **File Cleanup and Backup Automation**: Use Bash to automate the cleanup of old files in a directory and back up the remaining files to cloud storage. For instance, you can schedule a weekly task that removes files older than 30 days from a specific directory and then uploads a compressed archive of that directory to Google Drive using the Google Drive API.

- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Create a data processing pipeline where Bash scripts perform initial data manipulation tasks such as formatting and filtering on a dataset. Subsequently, pass the processed data to a Python script for more complex analysis or visualization, combining the simplicity of Bash for initial steps with the power of Python for in-depth processing.
