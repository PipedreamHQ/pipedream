# Overview

The Bash API on Pipedream allows you to leverage the full power of Bash scripting within your serverless workflows. You can execute any Bash script as part of a workflow, which means you can perform tasks like file manipulation, system administration, or any other activity that you could script on a Linux terminal. This integration is exceptionally powerful when combined with other apps on Pipedream, where Bash scripts can act as the glue or the transformation layer between various services' outputs and inputs.

# Example Use Cases

- **System Status Check and Notification**: Automatically run a Bash script to monitor the health status of your server (e.g., checking CPU usage, memory consumption). You can then use Pipedreamâ€™s Email API to send system health reports daily or trigger alerts when certain thresholds are exceeded.

- **Automated File Management**: Use a Bash script to organize files in a server directory based on file type, size, or modification date. This workflow can be tied to Dropbox or Google Drive on Pipedream to then sync these files to the cloud, providing a seamless backup solution.

- **Data Processing and Analysis**: Execute a Bash script to process and analyze log files or other data sources. The script could extract specific data points or patterns and feed them into a Pipedream workflow that leverages the Google Sheets API to populate a spreadsheet for easy visualization and further analysis.
