# Overview

Copper CRM's API unlocks the potential to streamline customer relationship management through automation and integration. On Pipedream, this means you can leverage event-driven workflows to sync contacts, manage deals, and automate tasks. Think of it as connecting Copper's insights directly to other apps or databases, triggering events in real-time based on CRM updates or capturing fresh leads instantaneously.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Entry Automation**: Automatically add new leads captured from a Google Form into Copper as contacts. Use Pipedream to listen for form submissions, then create or update contacts in Copper accordingly. This removes manual data entry and ensures your CRM is always up-to-date with the latest leads.

- **Deal Won Notification**: Set up a notification system that alerts your team via Slack whenever a deal is marked as won in Copper. This workflow would use Pipedream to monitor changes in deal status and post a celebratory message to a designated Slack channel, keeping everyone in the loop and fostering a culture of success.

- **Support Ticket Integration**: Integrate Copper with a helpdesk tool like Zendesk. When a support ticket is resolved, use Pipedream to check the customer's details in Copper and update the opportunity or contact record with the latest interaction details. This ensures your sales team has context on any support issues that have been addressed, potentially aiding in future sales or retention efforts.
