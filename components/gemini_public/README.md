# Overview

The Gemini Public API provides a gateway to interact with Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange platform, allowing users to access market data, such as current prices, volume, and order book information. Through Pipedream, developers can harness this data to build powerful, serverless workflows that react to market changes, automate trading analysis, and integrate cryptocurrency data into external applications or services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Crypto Market Alerts**: Build a workflow that monitors cryptocurrency prices on Gemini. When a specific asset hits a target price, trigger an alert via email or SMS using integrations like SendGrid or Twilio. This can help users act quickly on price movements.

- **Portfolio Valuation Scheduler**: Create a daily or hourly scheduled workflow on Pipedream that fetches your portfolio balances from Gemini, calculates the current valuation based on live market data, and logs this information to a Google Sheet for tracking and historical analysis.

- **Real-Time Trading Dashboard**: Pipe Gemini market data into a real-time dashboard using a service like Geckoboard or Klipfolio. Set up a Pipedream workflow that pushes current price and volume information at regular intervals, to keep the dashboard updated with the latest market conditions.
