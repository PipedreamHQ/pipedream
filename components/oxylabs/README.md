# Overview

The Oxylabs API provides robust tools for web data extraction, enabling you to gather vast amounts of data efficiently from various sources across the web. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can harness this power to create automated workflows that trigger on specific events, process the data, and connect to other services. Whether you're monitoring brand sentiment, tracking prices, or conducting market research, integrating Oxylabs with Pipedream can significantly streamline your data collection and analysis tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Brand Monitoring Automation**: Retrieve web data on brand mentions across different sites and social media platforms using the Oxylabs API. Dispatch this data to a sentiment analysis service like Google Cloud Natural Language API, and save the sentiment scores in a Google Sheet for real-time brand sentiment tracking.

- **Price Comparison Engine**: Schedule regular extractions of pricing data from e-commerce websites via the Oxylabs API. Use this data to compare your product prices against competitors. Pipedream can then update a dashboard in a tool like Geckoboard or send a Slack notification if a competitor changes their price.

- **Market Research Workflow**: Collect large-scale data sets from various industry sites using Oxylabs, and feed this data into a Pipedream workflow. Perform data transformation using Pipedream's built-in Node.js code steps, then store the results in a database like PostgreSQL or send it to a BI tool like Tableau for analysis and visualization.
