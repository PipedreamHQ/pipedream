# Overview

Sendlane's API taps into the power of email marketing automation allowing you to manage contacts, lists, campaigns, and more programmatically. With the Sendlane API on Pipedream, you can automate workflows that react to various triggers, such as incoming webhooks or scheduled times, to perform actions within Sendlane or other connected services. You can create complex, multi-step workflows that streamline your email marketing efforts, sync data across platforms, and personalize customer interactions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contact Syncing Between Platforms**: Sync new contacts from a CRM like HubSpot to Sendlane. Whenever a contact is added or updated in HubSpot, a Pipedream workflow triggers and updates or creates the contact in Sendlane, keeping your lists up-to-date automatically.

- **Dynamic Email Campaign Trigger**: Launch an email campaign in Sendlane based on customer behavior tracked in an e-commerce platform like Shopify. For instance, when a customer completes a purchase, Pipedream detects the event and triggers a Sendlane campaign to send a personalized thank you email or a post-purchase follow-up series.

- **Real-Time Analytics Reporting**: Send real-time analytics from Sendlane to a Google Sheet for easy monitoring. Pipedream can listen for campaign events, such as email opens or link clicks, then log this data into a Google Sheet, providing you with up-to-date campaign performance metrics.
