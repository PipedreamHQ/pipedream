# Overview

The Referrizer API lets you automate the engagement and tracking of your referral marketing campaigns. By integrating with Pipedream, you can stitch the Referrizer API into workflows that streamline your marketing efforts, track referrals, manage rewards, and sync customer data across multiple platforms. Pipedream’s serverless execution model allows you to focus on defining the logic without worrying about the infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Referral Sign-ups to CRM**: Automatically add new referral sign-ups from Referrizer to your CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. When a new referral is captured by Referrizer, trigger a workflow in Pipedream to create a new contact or update an existing one in your CRM, ensuring your sales team has the latest leads to follow up on.

- **Send Custom Thank-You Messages**: Craft personalized thank-you emails or SMS to customers who refer new clients through Twilio or SendGrid. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers when a referral is made on Referrizer, fetches the referrer’s contact details, and sends a customized message to thank them for their referral, reinforcing positive customer relationships.

- **Aggregate Referral Data for Analytics**: Collect and analyze referral data in real-time by sending it from Referrizer to Google Sheets or a database like PostgreSQL. Implement a Pipedream workflow that takes each new referral event, extracts relevant data, and appends it to a Google Sheet for easy tracking and analysis, giving you insights into the most effective referral sources.
