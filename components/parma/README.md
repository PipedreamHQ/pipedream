# Overview

The Parma API allows users to automate and enhance operations related to supply chain management, primarily focusing on logistics and inventory optimization. By leveraging machine learning models, the API offers predictions on inventory levels, demand forecasting, and optimal supply routes. This enables organizations to streamline their supply chain processes, reduce costs, and improve overall efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

Connect Parma API with the Shopify app on Pipedream to automatically adjust product stock based on predictive insights from Parma, ensuring optimal inventory levels are maintained without manual intervention.

- **Demand Forecasting Integration**: Integrate Parma APIâ€™s demand forecasting capabilities with a CRM system like Salesforce. By setting up a workflow on Pipedream that triggers daily, you can synchronize forecasted demand data into Salesforce, allowing sales teams to proactively adjust their strategies and operations based on upcoming demand trends.

- **Optimal Route Calculation for Deliveries**: Use Parma API to calculate the most efficient routes for delivery vehicles. This can be combined with Google Maps API on Pipedream to provide real-time routing adjustments to drivers. Set up a workflow that regularly updates routes based on traffic conditions, weather, and real-time incidents, ensuring the fastest delivery times and reducing fuel consumption.
