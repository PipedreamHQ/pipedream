# Overview

Docparser is a tool for extracting data from documents, such as PDFs, Word, and images. With the Docparser API, you can automate the process of capturing data without manual entry, transforming documents into actionable information. It shines in scenarios where structured information needs to be pulled from files that typically require manual data entry, such as invoices, forms, and reports.

# Example Use Cases

- **Invoice Processing Workflow**: Automate invoice data extraction by sending PDF invoices from an email to Docparser via Pipedream. Then, use Pipedream to pass the structured data to an accounting app like QuickBooks for invoice creation and archiving.
- **Employee Onboarding Documents**: Streamline the onboarding process by extracting details from new hire documents. When a document is uploaded to a cloud storage service, trigger a Pipedream workflow that uses Docparser to extract personal information and populate it in an HR management system like BambooHR.
- **Monthly Report Analysis**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to process monthly sales reports. Docparser can extract sales data from reports, which Pipedream then sends to a data visualization tool like Google Sheets or Tableau for tracking trends and generating insights.
