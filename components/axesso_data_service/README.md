# Overview

The Axesso Data Service - Amazon API lets you tap into a wealth of data from Amazon, including product searches, price trends, and reviews. In Pipedream, you can harness this data to drive insights, track products, and create custom notifications or reports. Pipedream’s serverless platform simplifies the process of setting up automated workflows that use the Axesso API to respond to events and perform actions in other apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Product Availability Tracker:** Set up a workflow on Pipedream that triggers daily to check the availability of specific products using the Axesso Data Service - Amazon API. If the product is in stock, automatically send a Slack message or email to notify your team or customers.

- **Price Change Alerts:** Create a Pipedream workflow that monitors price changes for products on Amazon. Use the Axesso API to fetch the latest prices and compare them with the previous day's prices stored in a Pipedream data store. If there’s a significant change, the workflow can post a message to a Discord channel or Twitter to alert followers.

- **Competitive Analysis Dashboard:** Build a Pipedream workflow that collects product data from Amazon on a weekly basis via the Axesso API. Aggregate and analyze this data to gain competitive insights. Then, use Google Sheets to create and update a dashboard that can be shared with your business team.
