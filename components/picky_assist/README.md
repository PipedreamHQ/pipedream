# Overview

Picky Assist bridges your communication channels with smart automation, letting you weave SMS, WhatsApp, and other messaging services into your business workflows. By integrating with Pipedream, you can automate interactions with customers, streamline notifications, or orchestrate multi-platform messaging campaigns. The API enables you to trigger messages based on events, sync conversations to CRMs, or even dispatch alerts from monitoring systems.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Ticket Creation**: When a customer sends a message via WhatsApp, Picky Assist can receive that message and use Pipedream to create a new support ticket in Zendesk or another customer service platform, ensuring no request is left unattended.

- **Real-Time Order Updates**: Connect Picky Assist with an e-commerce platform like Shopify on Pipedream. Automate the process of sending personalized order confirmation and shipping updates via SMS to customers when their order status changes.

- **Event-Triggered Alerts**: Combine Picky Assist with monitoring tools like Datadog. Set up a workflow on Pipedream that triggers an SMS to the on-call team if there's an incident or performance anomaly detected, providing timely response capabilities.
