# Overview

The VIES (VAT Information Exchange System) API lets you validate European VAT numbers. It's a tool for checking the validity of VAT numbers issued by any EU Member State, which is crucial for B2B transactions within the EU to ensure VAT compliance. In Pipedream, you can use the VIES API to automate workflows related to customer verification, invoicing, and compliance checks, streamlining the process of doing business across European borders.

# Example Use Cases

- **VAT Validation for New User Sign-ups**: When a new user signs up on your platform and provides a VAT number, trigger a Pipedream workflow to validate it via the VIES API. If it's valid, continue their onboarding process; if not, flag the account for review.

- **Periodic VAT Number Verification**: Set up a scheduled workflow to periodically check the validity of VAT numbers stored in your customer database. This ensures ongoing compliance and can automatically notify customers if their VAT number becomes invalid.

- **Automated VAT-Compliant Invoicing**: When creating invoices for EU customers, use the VIES API in a Pipedream workflow to validate VAT numbers and calculate the correct VAT amount. Integrate with accounting software like QuickBooks to automate the entire invoicing process.
