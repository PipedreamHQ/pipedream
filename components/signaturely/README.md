# Overview

Signaturely API lets you automate document signing processes within your apps. You can harness this functionality on Pipedream to create, send, and manage legally-binding signatures on documents without manual intervention. Whether you're sending contracts, onboarding new employees, or needing signatures from clients, integrating Signaturely with Pipedream can streamline your workflow, save time, and reduce errors.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Employee Onboarding**: Automatically send onboarding documents when a new employee is added to your HR system. Once the employee details are entered into your HR app, trigger a Pipedream workflow to send the necessary documents via Signaturely for e-signature.

- **Contract Management**: When a new contract is created in your CRM, use this trigger to send the contract through Signaturely for signature. After the contract is signed, Pipedream can update the status in your CRM and store the signed document in a cloud storage service like Google Drive.

- **Client Onboarding**: Initiate a seamless onboarding experience for your clients by sending all necessary paperwork through Signaturely once they sign up through your website. Integrate with form submission tools like Typeform on Pipedream to detect new submissions and trigger the document signing process.
