# Overview

The SharpSpring API offers a gateway to an extensive marketing platform, enabling you to automate your marketing workflows, manage customer relationships, and glean insights from comprehensive analytics. With Pipedream, you can harness this power to create seamless integrations that trigger actions in SharpSpring based on external events or data, sync leads and contacts across platforms, and personalize marketing efforts based on user behavior and preferences.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Scoring Automation**: Automatically adjust lead scores in SharpSpring based on interactions captured from other platforms. For instance, if a lead watches a webinar on Zoom, Pipedream can catch the webinar attendance webhook and update the lead score in SharpSpring, ensuring your sales team prioritizes hot leads.

- **Cross-Platform Contact Sync**: Keep SharpSpring contacts in sync with other CRMs like Salesforce or HubSpot. When a new contact is added to Salesforce, Pipedream can detect the event and create or update that contact in SharpSpring, maintaining consistency across your sales tools.

- **Personalized Email Campaigns Triggered by Behavior**: Trigger personalized email campaigns in SharpSpring based on customer behavior tracked on your website or app. For example, if a user abandons a shopping cart, Pipedream can capture this event, and SharpSpring can send a tailored email to encourage purchase completion.
