# Overview

The Google Directory API enables you to perform administrative operations on users, groups, organizational units, and devices within a Google Workspace domain. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to create automated workflows that manage directory resources, sync information, and streamline admin tasks. Pipedream's serverless platform allows you to trigger these workflows on schedules or events, integrating seamlessly with other apps to enrich and act upon the data.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated User Provisioning**: When a new employee is added to your HR system (e.g., BambooHR), trigger a Pipedream workflow to create a new user in Google Workspace, assign them to the appropriate organizational unit, and enroll them in essential groups for email lists and access permissions.

- **Dynamic Group Membership Updates**: Use a Pipedream workflow to monitor changes in project management tools like Asana or Trello. When a member's project role changes, automatically update their Google Group memberships to reflect their new responsibilities, ensuring they have the right access and communication channels.

- **Directory Sync with External Databases**: Schedule a regular Pipedream workflow that fetches user information from an external database (such as PostgreSQL) and updates user profiles in Google Directory to keep contact details and organizational information in sync across business systems.
