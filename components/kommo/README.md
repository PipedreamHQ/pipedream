# Overview

The Kommo API allows users to manage CRM functionalities programmatically. It's designed for businesses looking to automate their customer relationship tasks, enabling them to manage leads, deals, contacts, and customer interactions directly through the API. On Pipedream, this integration can power workflows that automate routine sales processes, enhance customer data management, and sync with other tools to maintain a cohesive business ecosystem.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Capture and Auto-Assignment Workflow**  
  When a new lead is captured through a website form (using apps like Typeform or Google Forms), the lead's details can be automatically pushed to Kommo. Based on predefined rules (like region or product interest), the lead can then be assigned to the appropriate sales team member in Kommo, ensuring swift and relevant follow-up.

- **Customer Feedback to Support Ticket**  
  After receiving customer feedback via email or a survey tool (like SurveyMonkey), analyze the sentiment using a tool like MonkeyLearn. If the feedback is negative, automatically create a support ticket in Kommo to address the customer's concerns promptly. This workflow helps in maintaining high customer satisfaction levels and quick resolution times.

- **Sales Pipeline Automation**  
  Sync Kommo with a communications tool like Slack. Set up notifications to alert team members in Slack whenever a deal moves to a new stage in the sales pipeline on Kommo. This keeps the team updated in real-time, enhancing communication and efficiency in managing sales progress.
