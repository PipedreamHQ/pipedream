# Overview

The Bugsnag API enables you to interact programmatically with Bugsnag data, letting you manage and access error reports, project settings, and release tracking for your applications. With Pipedream's integration, you can automate workflows that respond to new errors, aggregate error data for analysis, or synchronize error information with other tools in your development stack.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Error Notification to Slack**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever a new error is reported to Bugsnag. The workflow can format the error data and send a notification to a Slack channel, ensuring your team is immediately aware of issues.

- **Error Triage with GitHub Issues**: When Bugsnag captures a critical error, use Pipedream to create a GitHub issue for it. This workflow can include error details and link back to Bugsnag, helping developers start the debugging process right from their issue tracker.

- **Daily Error Summary Email**: Set up a scheduled workflow on Pipedream that fetches the day's errors from Bugsnag, summarizes them, and then sends an email report. This daily digest can help your team stay informed about the app's health without having to check Bugsnag manually.
