# Overview

The Clio API offers a powerful way for law firms and legal professionals to automate and streamline their operations. By integrating with Pipedream, users can create custom workflows that leverage Clio's capabilities such as managing cases, tracking time, billing, and client communications. With Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform, these automations can be triggered by a vast array of events and can connect Clio with other apps and services to enhance productivity and data consistency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Time Tracking Automation**: Automatically log billable hours in Clio when a timer is stopped in a time tracking app like Toggl. This workflow could check for new time entries in Toggl and create corresponding time entries in Clio, ensuring accurate and up-to-date billing records.

- **New Client Onboarding**: Streamline the process of adding new clients to Clio by triggering an automation when a new client form is submitted through a service like Typeform. The workflow can create a new matter in Clio, generate a welcome email via Gmail or SendGrid, and schedule an initial consultation in Google Calendar.

- **Document Management Sync**: Keep all legal documents in sync between Clio and cloud storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive. Whenever a document is uploaded to a specific case folder in the cloud service, the workflow would create a link in the corresponding matter in Clio, keeping case-related documents organized and accessible.
