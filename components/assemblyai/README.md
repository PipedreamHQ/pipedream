# Overview

The AssemblyAI API offers robust capabilities for transcribing audio and video files, analyzing content sentiment, and spotting particular keywords or topics. With Pipedream, you can harness this power to automate workflows that require audio processing and analysis, integrating with other apps to create a seamless data pipeline for audio intelligence.

## Example Use Cases

- **Transcription Triggered from Dropbox Uploads**: When a new audio file is added to Dropbox, use Pipedream to trigger the AssemblyAI API to transcribe it. Then, store the transcription results in a Google Sheet for easy review and collaboration.

- **Podcast Content Analysis**: Analyze podcast episodes uploaded to your server using AssemblyAI for content moderation or sentiment analysis. After processing, send the analytical insights to Slack to notify your content team.

- **Voice Memo to Task**: Convert voice memos into tasks. Once a voice memo is uploaded to a particular cloud storage, Pipedream triggers AssemblyAI to transcribe the memo. Translate the transcription into an actionable task in a tool like Trello or Asana.
