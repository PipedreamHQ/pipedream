# Overview

The ONLYOFFICE DocSpace API offers robust functionalities to manage documents online, allowing users to create, edit, share, and collaborate on text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations directly from web applications. Integrated into Pipedream, this API can automate document workflows, synchronize files across platforms, and enhance collaboration efficiency by connecting with various other apps and services, such as Slack for notifications or Google Drive for storage.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Document Backup to Cloud Storage**: When a new document is created or updated in ONLYOFFICE DocSpace, use Pipedream to automatically back it up to Google Drive. This ensures that all changes are saved in real-time and your documents are secure in a secondary location.

- **Document Approval Workflow**: Set up a workflow where any new document uploaded to ONLYOFFICE DocSpace triggers an approval request sent via email (using an email service like SendGrid). After approval, the documentâ€™s status updates in ONLYOFFICE DocSpace and a notification is sent to a Slack channel informing the team of the approval.

- **Collaboration Alert System**: Whenever a document is commented on or edited in ONLYOFFICE DocSpace, trigger a workflow that sends real-time alerts to a designated Slack channel. This keeps the team informed about updates and enhances collaboration by ensuring that everyone is on the same page.
