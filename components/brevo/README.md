# Overview

The Brevo API offers you the power to automate and integrate a wide range of HR tasks right within Pipedream. Whether you're looking to streamline onboarding processes, manage employee records, or synchronize HR data across various platforms, Brevo's endpoints can be a linchpin in your automation setup. With Pipedream's serverless platform, these API calls can be orchestrated with other services to create robust, automated workflows that save time and eliminate manual work.

## Example Use Cases

- **Employee Onboarding Automation**: When a new employee is added to Brevo, trigger a Pipedream workflow to send a welcome email, create accounts on necessary services like Slack or GitHub, and schedule their first-week meetings automatically.

- **Performance Review Tracker**: Use Brevo API to fetch employee performance data and feed it into a Google Sheet or Airtable base. Trigger alerts via email or Slack when it's time for managers to conduct performance reviews, ensuring timely feedback and employee development.

- **Time-Off Management**: Create a workflow that listens for time-off requests on Brevo. Once a request is received, it can be automatically added to a shared company calendar, and a notification sent to the manager for approval on Slack or via email.
