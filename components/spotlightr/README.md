# Overview

The Spotlightr API provides a platform for users to interact with their Spotlightr video content and analytics programmatically. Using Pipedream, you can automate various tasks such as uploading videos, managing video settings, and retrieving video analytics. This empowers you to integrate video-related workflows into your business processes, enhance content management, and gain insights from video engagement data, all through serverless workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Dynamic Video Content Update for Marketing Campaigns**: Connect Spotlightr with a CRM like HubSpot. Whenever a new lead is added to a specific campaign in HubSpot, trigger a workflow that updates a Spotlightr video's settings or content to tailor it to the campaign, enhancing the viewer's experience.
