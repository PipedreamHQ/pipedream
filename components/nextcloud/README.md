# Overview

Nextcloud's API lets you tap into your self-hosted cloud storage and collaboration platform. With Pipedream, you can automate tasks like file management, user account operations, and accessing calendar and contacts. It's a treasure trove for creating workflows that sync, share, and manage data programmatically between Nextcloud and other apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated File Synchronization:** Create a workflow that monitors a specific folder in Dropbox (or any other cloud storage service) for new files and automatically uploads them to a designated folder in Nextcloud.

- **Contacts Sync Between Platforms:** Whenever a new contact is added to your Google Contacts, have a Pipedream workflow that pushes that contact into your Nextcloud Contacts, keeping your address books in sync across platforms.

- **Calendar Event Alert System:** Set up a Pipedream workflow where, if a new event is added to your Nextcloud Calendar, a message with event details is sent out via Slack to keep your team informed and aligned.
