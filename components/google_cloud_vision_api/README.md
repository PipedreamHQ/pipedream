# Overview

The Google Cloud Vision API allows you to analyze images in the cloud, harnessing Google's machine learning technology. You can detect and classify multiple objects, face and landmark detection, handwriting recognition, and image attributes. Combining this with Pipedream's serverless platform catalyzes the creation of automated workflows to process images, trigger actions, and integrate with other services seamlessly.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Moderation System**: Use Google Cloud Vision API to detect explicit content in images uploaded to a cloud storage service like Dropbox or Google Drive. Once an image is flagged, Pipedream can automate notifications, remove the image, or log the event in a database for review.

- **Label-based Image Organization**: Employ the API to tag images with labels and then use Pipedream to sort and store them in relevant folders in services such as Google Photos or Amazon S3. This can be useful for digital asset management, making it easier to search and retrieve images based on their content.

- **Automated Data Extraction from Scanned Documents**: Leverage the API's OCR capabilities to extract text from scanned documents or images. Pipedream can take this data, format it, and then input it into a spreadsheet on Google Sheets or a record in Airtable, streamlining data entry and archival processes.
