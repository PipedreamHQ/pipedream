# Overview

The Defastra API is a tool designed for automating and integrating your cybersecurity efforts. It offers features such as vulnerability scans, monitoring of dark web activities, and risk assessments. When combined with Pipedreamâ€™s capabilities, you can create powerful, automated workflows to enhance your security posture. You can trigger events in real-time, process data, and connect to numerous other services, all of which help in proactively managing cybersecurity threats.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Vulnerability Alerts**: Set up a workflow that triggers a Defastra vulnerability scan on your assets periodically. Once the scan is complete, automatically parse the results and send alerts with details of any new vulnerabilities via Slack to your security team.

- **Dark Web Monitoring Notifications**: Use the Defastra API to monitor specific keywords or data related to your organization on the dark web. Create a Pipedream workflow that sends notifications through email or a messaging platform like Microsoft Teams whenever your monitoring uncovers potentially malicious activities.

- **Risk Assessment Reports**: Implement a workflow that periodically triggers a risk assessment for your projects or digital assets using Defastra. After the assessment is finished, automatically generate a report and save it to Google Drive, and then notify the relevant stakeholders through a Pipedream-supported communication app like Twilio SMS.
