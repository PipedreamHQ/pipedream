# Overview

The PrintNode API on Pipedream allows you to integrate cloud printing capabilities into workflows. It supports automating print jobs, managing printers, and querying printer status. With Pipedream's ability to connect to 3,000+ apps, you can trigger print jobs from emails, forms, databases, or custom events. The API's functions can be weaved into broader business processes to streamline document handling.

# Example Use Cases

- **Print Shipping Labels on New Orders**: Automatically print shipping labels when new orders come in from an eCommerce platform like Shopify. When an order is placed, Pipedream triggers a workflow that sends the order's shipping label to a designated printer via PrintNode.

- **Print Invoices on Payment Confirmation**: Set up a workflow where invoices are automatically printed when payment is confirmed through payment processors like Stripe or PayPal. Once the payment succeeds, a PDF invoice is generated and sent to PrintNode for printing.

- **Daily Printout of Sales Reports**: Schedule a daily workflow that queries your sales database, generates a report, and prints it using PrintNode. This could be connected to apps like Google Sheets or Airtable where your sales data is updated.
