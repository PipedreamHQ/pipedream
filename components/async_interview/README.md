# Overview

The Async Interview API enables automation around video interview processes. With this API, you can craft workflows on Pipedream that manipulate interview data, initiate new interviews, and respond to events within the Async Interview platform. Pipedream's serverless architecture allows you to connect with hundreds of apps to streamline recruitment workflows, analyze interview data, or enhance the candidate experience with personalized interactions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Candidate Follow-Up**: After an interview is completed, trigger an automated email to the candidate with personalized feedback or next steps using the Gmail app.

- **Interview Data Analysis**: Gather interview responses and feed them into a Google Sheets document for further analysis, allowing HR teams to make data-driven decisions.

- **Scheduling Interviews**: Integrate with a calendar service like Google Calendar to automatically schedule interviews once a candidate passes a certain application stage, and send calendar invites to both interviewers and candidates.
