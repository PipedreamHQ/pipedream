# Overview

The HTML to Image API allows users to convert HTML code and CSS into high-quality images programmatically. This API is perfect for generating snapshots of web content for archiving, sharing, or integrating into documents and presentations. On Pipedream, this capability can be expanded by automating the image creation process and integrating it with other services for comprehensive workflows, such as generating marketing materials, preparing reports, or archiving web content automatically.
