# Overview

The HTML to Image API allows you to convert HTML code into high-quality images programmatically. This API is particularly useful on Pipedream, where you can integrate it into workflows to automate the generation of images from dynamic HTML content. Whether it's generating receipts, certificates, or just rendering webpage snapshots for archiving, this API simplifies the process by handling the HTML to image conversion seamlessly.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Report Generation**: Automate the creation of visual reports by converting HTML templates into PNG or JPEG formats. These reports can then be emailed to stakeholders using the Pipedream's Email by Zapier app integration.

- **Dynamic Content Sharing**: Generate images from HTML content of daily news summaries or content feeds, and auto-post them to social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook using their respective Pipedream app integrations.

- **Customer Engagement**: Enhance customer engagement by automatically generating personalized certificates or coupons as images from HTML, which can then be attached to customer emails or SMS messages through integrations with apps like SendGrid or Twilio on Pipedream.
