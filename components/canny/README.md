# Overview

The Canny API provides programmatic access to Canny's customer feedback management platform. With it, you can automate the collection, analysis, and response to user feedback. This includes creating posts, voting on behalf of users, fetching boards, and managing comments and tags. Such integrations can streamline how you gather insights and act on user suggestions, making sure the voice of the customer is heard and addressed efficiently.

# Example Use Cases

- **Feedback Loop Automation**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream when a new feedback post is created on Canny. This can be further integrated to notify a Slack channel, create a task in a project management tool like Trello, or log the feedback in a Google Sheet for review during product meetings.

- **Customer Support Enhancement**: When a customer support ticket in Zendesk or another service mentions a feature request or bug, automatically check Canny for related posts and link them. If none exist, create a new feedback post in Canny, ensuring the team is aware of customer needs and can prioritize them accordingly.

- **Product Roadmap Planning**: On a schedule, compile votes and comments from Canny and feed them into a BI tool like Google Data Studio or Tableau. Analyze trends to inform product roadmap decisions, ensuring that the most requested features are given priority.
