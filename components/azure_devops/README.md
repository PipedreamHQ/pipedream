# Overview

The Azure DevOps API offers a suite of tools to support the software development lifecycle, from planning and tracking work with Boards, managing code repositories in Repos, automating builds and deployments with Pipelines, to testing and releasing applications. By integrating Azure DevOps with Pipedream, you can automate interactions with your DevOps workflows, trigger actions based on events, and connect with other apps to streamline processes. Pipedream's serverless platform provides the glue to orchestrate these tasks with minimal setup.

## Example Use Cases

- **Auto-Trigger Deployments**: When a new commit is pushed to a specific branch in an Azure DevOps Repo, Pipedream can automatically trigger a Pipeline to deploy the latest code to a staging environment. This ensures that the most recent changes are always tested.

- **Work Item Synchronization**: Sync Azure Boards with an external project management tool like Jira or Asana. Whenever a work item is created or updated in Azure DevOps, Pipedream can create or update a corresponding task in the other tool, keeping cross-functional teams in sync.

- **Release Notifications**: Set up a workflow where Pipedream listens for a successful release event in Azure DevOps and then sends a notification via Slack, email, or SMS. This keeps the team informed about new versions and deployment statuses in real-time.
