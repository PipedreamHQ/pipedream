# Overview

The Blocknative API is a powerful tool for real-time Ethereum blockchain monitoring. It allows developers to track transactions with precision, getting notified of state changes, from mempool to confirmation. By leveraging this with Pipedream's capabilities, you can create automated workflows that respond to events like transaction status updates, address activity, and gas price changes. This can be particularly useful for applications that need to react instantly to on-chain activities, such as trading bots, wallet services, or notification systems.

# Example Use Cases

- **Transaction Status Monitoring**: Set up a workflow that listens for transaction events from Blocknative API and sends updates via Slack or email when a transaction involving a watched Ethereum address is confirmed or fails. This can provide real-time alerts for users tracking their transactions.

- **Smart Contract Interaction Tracker**: Create a workflow to monitor interactions with a specific smart contract. When the Blocknative API detects a new transaction to the contract, use Pipedream to process the data and store transaction details in a Google Sheets document for analysis. This is ideal for developers who want to audit interactions with their deployed contracts.

- **Dynamic Gas Price Adjustment**: Leverage Blocknative API to watch for changes in the Ethereum gas price. Use a Pipedream workflow to automatically adjust the gas price settings in a cryptocurrency trading app, ensuring that your transactions are timely and cost-efficient. Connect this with a database like Airtable to log gas price trends over time.
