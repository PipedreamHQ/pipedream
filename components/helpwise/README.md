# Overview

The Helpwise API empowers you to automate and enhance your shared inbox experience. With it, you can programmatically manage emails, SMS, and other communications within your team's shared inboxes. By leveraging the Helpwise API on Pipedream, you can create efficient workflows that respond to inbound messages, synchronize communications with CRM platforms, organize customer interactions, and streamline various support processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Ticket Labeling and Assignment**: When a new email arrives in Helpwise, use Pipedream to analyze its content and automatically assign it to the appropriate team member based on predefined criteria such as keywords or sender info. Pipedream can also add relevant labels to help categorize and prioritize the support tickets.

- **Synchronized CRM Updates**: After resolving a support issue in Helpwise, trigger a workflow on Pipedream to update the customer's record in your CRM, such as Salesforce or HubSpot. This can include logging the resolution details, updating the status of the ticket, and ensuring that all team members have the latest information.

- **Customer Feedback Collection**: Configure Pipedream to send a follow-up survey via email or SMS to customers whose tickets have been closed in Helpwise. Collect the feedback and aggregate the results in a Google Sheet or a dashboard tool like Tableau for analysis, helping your team to improve service quality.
