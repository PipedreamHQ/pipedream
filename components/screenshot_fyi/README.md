# Overview

The screenshot.fyi API enables users to programmatically capture screenshots of web pages. It's a powerful tool for developers using Pipedream to automate tasks involving visual content verification, archiving web pages, or integrating rich previews into applications. With Pipedreamâ€™s capabilities, you can trigger screenshot captures based on various events, process the images, and integrate them with other services like email, cloud storage, or CMS platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Monitoring and Archiving**: Automatically capture and store screenshots of specified web pages daily. This can be useful for tracking changes, compliance auditing, or archiving purposes. Use Pipedream's cron job feature to schedule daily triggers, capture screenshots using screenshot.fyi, and save them to Google Drive or Dropbox.

- **Visual Change Detection**: Set up a workflow to monitor visual changes on a competitor's homepage. Use screenshot.fyi to take daily or weekly screenshots, compare them with previous captures using an image processing API, and send alerts via Slack or email if significant changes are detected.

- **Automated Reporting for Client Websites**: Create automated workflows for generating visual reports of client websites. Use screenshot.fyi to capture screenshots of key pages, compile them into a PDF, and email the report to clients monthly. This can be particularly useful for web development agencies or marketing firms to show progress or maintain transparency with clients.
