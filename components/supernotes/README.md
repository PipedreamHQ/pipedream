# Overview

The Supernotes API lets you automate your note-taking and knowledge management tasks. With Supernotes, you can create, update, and organize cards, collaborate on notes with teammates, and track changes in your knowledge base. Using Pipedream, you can harness these abilities to create intricate workflows that leverage the capabilities of Supernotes in concert with hundreds of other services, creating a seamless integration for productivity and collaboration.

# Example Use Cases

- **Card Creation Automation**: Automatically create Supernotes cards from emails flagged as important in Gmail. When an email meets certain criteria, Pipedream can capture the content and create a card in Supernotes, ensuring you have a note of all crucial information without manual entry.

- **Daily Digest Compilation**: Build a workflow that gathers all new cards from Supernotes and compiles them into a daily digest. This digest can then be sent to Slack, giving you and your team an overview of the day's notes and updates without having to leave your communication platform.

- **Content Triggered Actions**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for specific keywords or tags in newly created Supernotes cards. When a match is found, trigger an action such as sending a notification to Discord or creating a task in Asana, linking back to the relevant card for quick reference.
