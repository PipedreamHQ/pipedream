On a customer's birthday, use the API to create a custom birthday greeting image and post it to your social media platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter, using their respective Pipedream actions.

- **Event-Triggered Promotional Material**: Leverage Supportivekoala to generate unique promotional images when a specific event occurs, such as a sale or product launch. Set up a workflow that listens for webhook events from your e-commerce platform like Shopify. When the event is triggered, use the Supportivekoala API to create an image with the sale details and distribute it across various marketing channels.
