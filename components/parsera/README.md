# Overview

Parsera API is a robust interface designed for parsing and extracting data from various document formats with high precision. This can be particularly useful in automating data extraction tasks, transforming unstructured data into a structured format, and integrating parsed data into other systems or workflows, enhancing efficiency and reducing manual data handling.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing**: Set up a workflow where invoices received as email attachments are automatically sent to Parsera for parsing. The extracted data (like invoice number, date, totals, and line items) can be then posted to an accounting software like QuickBooks for seamless financial management.

- **Email Attachment Management and Data Extraction**: Create a workflow that monitors your email for specific attachment types. Use Parsera to extract relevant data from these attachments, which could then be automatically added to a Google Sheets spreadsheet for further analysis or record-keeping.

- **Real-Time Document Conversion and Data Extraction for Customer Support**: Implement a system where customer submitted documents (such as forms or applications in PDF) are instantly sent to Parsera via a Pipedream workflow. Extract essential information and update a CRM like Salesforce, providing real-time assistance and record updates without manual data entry.
