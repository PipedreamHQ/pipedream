# Overview

SheetDB is a tool that turns a Google Sheet into a RESTful API, allowing you to read and write data on the fly. With Pipedream, you can easily automate workflows by interfacing with the SheetDB API to perform CRUD operations. By leveraging Pipedream's built-in connectors for various apps, you can integrate SheetDB with other services to streamline data management, reporting, and synchronization tasks across your tech stack.

# Example Use Cases

- **Order Processing Automation**: When a new order comes in via an e-commerce platform like Shopify, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that adds a new row to a Google Sheet through SheetDB. Simultaneously, it can send an email with order details via SendGrid to the fulfillment team, ensuring that they have real-time order information.

- **Lead Capture and Follow-Up**: Capture leads from a marketing form built with Typeform. Whenever a new form entry is submitted, Pipedream can append the lead's details to a Google Sheet using SheetDB. It can then trigger an automated follow-up sequence in Mailchimp to nurture the lead through the sales funnel.

- **Inventory Management**: Keep inventory levels synced across platforms by using Pipedream to monitor stock changes. When an item's stock level is updated in your e-commerce platform, like WooCommerce, Pipedream can reflect these changes in a Google Sheet via SheetDB. This ensures inventory accuracy and can trigger restock notifications if levels fall below a certain threshold.
