# Overview

SheetDB API turns your Google Sheets into a JSON API, enabling you to manage the content within your spreadsheet through RESTful endpoints. With Pipedream, you can harness this capability to build robust automations and workflows that interact with your spreadsheet data dynamically. Whether you're updating rows based on external triggers, syncing data to other platforms, or building a makeshift CRM, SheetDB paired with Pipedream's zero-management execution environment lets you deploy these solutions rapidly.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Management System (CMS)**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever a row is added to your SheetDB-backed Google Sheet, automatically creating a blog post in WordPress. This workflow listens for new entries and uses the WordPress API to publish content, effectively turning your Google Sheet into a simple CMS.

- **Customer Feedback Aggregation**: Connect SheetDB with a customer service platform like Zendesk. When a support ticket is resolved, Pipedream triggers an update to a dedicated Google Sheet through SheetDB, summarizing feedback. This workflow enables easy tracking of customer satisfaction trends over time.

- **Inventory Management Alert System**: Link SheetDB with a messaging app like Slack. Track inventory levels in a Google Sheet and set a Pipedream workflow to monitor stock quantities via SheetDB. Once inventory drops below a threshold, it sends an alert to a Slack channel, prompting a restock action.
