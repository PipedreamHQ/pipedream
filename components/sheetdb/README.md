# Overview

SheetDB turns your Google Sheets into a simple REST API, enabling you to read and write sheet data programmatically. In Pipedream, you can harness this API to create serverless workflows that interact with your sheet data, automating tasks like data collection, inventory tracking, or integrating with other apps. You can set up triggers to initiate workflows from various events and use actions to craft your custom logic, making your Google Sheets an integral part of your automated processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Customer Data from CRM to Google Sheets**: Whenever a new customer is added to your CRM (like Salesforce or HubSpot), initiate a workflow that adds or updates their details in a Google Sheet via SheetDB. This ensures your marketing or sales teams have the latest data without manual entry.

- **Process Orders with Payment Platforms**: Connect SheetDB to a payment platform like Stripe. When a new payment is successful, trigger a workflow to log the transaction details in your Google Sheets, keeping a real-time record of sales and inventory that can be accessed and analyzed by your finance team.

- **Aggregate Survey Responses**: After collecting responses from a survey platform like Typeform, use Pipedream to send the data to Google Sheets through SheetDB. This can be set to happen in real-time, allowing for immediate analysis and reporting on survey data.
