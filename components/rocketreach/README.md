# Overview

The RocketReach API lets you tap into a vast database of professionals to find email addresses, phone numbers, and social media profiles. With it, you can enrich lead data, automate the process of lead generation, and integrate this enriched data into your CRM or marketing automation tools. Pipedream's platform allows you to create serverless workflows using the RocketReach API to trigger events, handle data, and connect with countless other apps to streamline your processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Enrichment Workflow**: Automatically enrich new leads added to your CRM (like Salesforce) by triggering a Pipedream workflow when a new lead is created. The workflow would use the RocketReach API to fetch additional contact information and then update the lead's record in Salesforce with this data.

- **Cold Outreach Automation**: Set up a workflow that listens for new sign-ups on your website via a webhook. For each sign-up, use RocketReach to find additional contact details and then automatically send personalized cold outreach emails using a service like SendGrid or Mailgun.

- **Social Media Lead Generation**: Create a flow that monitors mentions of specific keywords on Twitter using the Twitter Developer App. With each mention, use RocketReach to find the contact details of the Twitter user and then add them to a Google Sheets spreadsheet for lead tracking and further outreach campaigns.
