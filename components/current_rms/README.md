# Overview

Current RMS is a cloud-based rental management system that streamlines operations for AV, broadcast, lighting, and event companies. With its API, you can automate inventory tracking, job and quote management, and client communications. Using Pipedream, you can integrate Current RMS with other apps to automate workflows, trigger actions based on rental status updates, synchronize data across platforms, or push notifications to team members, enhancing efficiency and reducing manual entry.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Invoice Generation and Emailing**: - When a rental order status in Current RMS changes to 'Completed', automatically generate an invoice using the Current RMS API and email it to the customer using the SendGrid app on Pipedream. This workflow ensures timely billing and enhances customer service by reducing the manual processing time.

- **Sync Rental Status with Calendar**: - Connect Current RMS to Google Calendar via Pipedream to automatically create or update calendar events based on rental check-out and check-in dates. This workflow helps teams keep track of equipment availability and rental periods directly from their calendars, improving resource planning and management.

- **Customer Feedback Collection on Rental Return**: - Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when an item is marked as returned in Current RMS to send a personalized feedback request email to the customer using the Mailgun app. This automated process can help gather insights about the rental experience, aiding in service improvement and customer relationship management.
