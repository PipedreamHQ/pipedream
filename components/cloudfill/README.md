# Overview

The CloudFill API specializes in automatic form filling, allowing you to pre-fill web forms with accurate and up-to-date information programmatically. With CloudFill on Pipedream, you can create serverless workflows that trigger form filling operations, handle data extracted from forms, and connect to other apps to streamline complex tasks like data entry, customer onboarding, and lead generation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Onboarding**: On receiving a new customer signup via a CRM like Salesforce, trigger a Pipedream workflow that uses CloudFill to auto-populate registration and onboarding forms with the customer's details. The workflow can then email the pre-filled forms to the customer for review, improving the onboarding experience and reducing manual data entry.

- **Dynamic Lead Generation Forms**: Combine CloudFill with a marketing tool like Mailchimp on Pipedream. When a potential lead downloads a resource or signs up for a webinar, have CloudFill pre-fill a personalized follow-up form based on the information they provided. Then, use Mailchimp to send the form to the lead, increasing engagement with a customized approach.

- **Streamlined Invoice Processing**: In an e-commerce scenario, when a new order is placed and captured by a Pipedream workflow, employ CloudFill to automatically fill out an invoice template with the order details. This invoice can then be sent to an accounting app like QuickBooks for payment processing, ensuring accuracy and saving valuable time.
