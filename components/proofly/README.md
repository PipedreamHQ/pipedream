# Overview

The Proofly API enables you to create, manage, and deploy social proof notifications on your website to boost conversions. It provides various endpoints that allow you to automate the process of updating notifications based on specific triggers or events. Using Pipedream, you can create workflows that integrate with the Proofly API to dynamically control these notifications, respond to analytics, and sync with your marketing or sales tools to optimize user engagement.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Notification Updates Based on User Behavior**: Using Pipedream, you can design a workflow that listens for webhooks from your analytics platform, then triggers Proofly API to update notifications when a user performs a specific action like signing up or completing a purchase.

- **Sync Proofly Campaigns with Email Marketing**: Craft a workflow that ties Proofly notifications with your email campaigns. When a new email subscriber is added to your Mailchimp list, for instance, trigger a Proofly notification on your site to welcome the new subscriber and incentivize further engagement.

- **Aggregate Feedback for A/B Testing**: Assemble a workflow that utilizes Proofly API to switch between different notification designs or messages based on user interaction data piped in from your A/B testing platform. Use this data to determine which notifications are most effective at converting visitors.
