# Overview

The Amazon Polly API lets you convert text into lifelike speech using deep learning. With Polly, you can create applications that talk and build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products. Pipedream's platform enables you to integrate Polly's capabilities into workflows that can automate tasks, like generating audio files from blog posts or alert messages, and piping them to various services or storage solutions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Blog Post to Podcast**: Automatically convert new blog posts to audio. When a new post is published to your CMS (like WordPress), Pipedream can trigger a workflow that sends the text to Amazon Polly, which then returns an audio stream. The audio file is then uploaded to a podcast hosting platform or cloud storage for distribution.

- **Real-time Alerts to Speech Notifications**: Turn alerts from monitoring tools like Datadog into spoken notifications. When an alert is triggered, it's sent to Pipedream, where Polly generates an audio message. This message could be played over a PA system or sent as a voice notification to a team's phones.

- **Language Learning App**: Enhance a language-learning platform by providing users with pronunciation examples. As users submit text, it goes through Pipedream to Polly, which translates the text into spoken words in the chosen language. The audio can then be embedded back into the app for the users to listen to.
