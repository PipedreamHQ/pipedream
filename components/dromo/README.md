# Overview

The Dromo API is a logistics and shipment tracking service that provides real-time data on shipments across carriers. With this API, you can tap into a vast network of shipping information, automate tracking processes, send notifications on shipment updates, and integrate your logistics data with other business systems. On Pipedream, you can create workflows that leverage the Dromo API to connect with various apps, automate shipment tracking updates, and streamline logistics processes.
