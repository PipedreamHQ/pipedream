# Overview

Flutterwave is a payment gateway that enables businesses to process payments from customers across the globe. Through its API, you can automate payment collections, disbursements, and monitor transaction statuses in real-time. On Pipedream, leveraging the Flutterwave API allows you to create powerful serverless workflows that can automate financial operations, integrate with other business tools, and ensure seamless payment processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time Payment Alerts to Slack**: Automate notifications to a Slack channel whenever a payment is received. This keeps your team immediately informed about new transactions, improving response times for customer service and finance updates.

- **Automated Invoice Generation with Google Sheets**: Upon receiving a payment, trigger a workflow that creates an invoice in Google Sheets. This can be particularly useful for keeping financial records up to date without manual data entry.

- **Conditional Email Responses via SendGrid**: Set up a workflow where, depending on the transaction amount or payment status, an email is automatically sent via SendGrid. For instance, for transactions over a specified threshold, send a personalized thank you email, or for failed transactions, send a follow-up email to resolve issues.
