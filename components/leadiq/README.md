# Overview

The LeadIQ API enables seamless integration of LeadIQâ€™s capabilities into various marketing and sales workflows, automating the lead capture and enrichment processes. By harnessing this API on Pipedream, you can automate the extraction of lead data, sync it with CRM systems, and trigger personalized outreach campaigns, all within a serverless environment. This reduces manual tasks, enhances lead quality, and accelerates the sales pipeline.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Leads to Salesforce Automatically**: When a new lead is captured or updated in LeadIQ, automatically push this data to Salesforce. This keeps your CRM up-to-date and ensures that sales teams have immediate access to the latest lead information.

- **Email Campaign Trigger on Lead Capture**: Set up an automated workflow where capturing a new lead via LeadIQ triggers a personalized email campaign via Mailchimp or another email marketing service. This can be used to immediately engage new leads with a welcome message or promotional offers, enhancing conversion rates.

- **Slack Notifications for Sales Teams**: Configure a workflow where any update or new addition to your leads in LeadIQ sends an instant notification to a designated Slack channel. This keeps your sales team informed in real-time, enabling prompt follow-ups that could potentially boost sales conversions.
