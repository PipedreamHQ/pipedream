# Overview

The Concord API provides access to a contract management platform that lets users automate the creation, negotiation, signing, and management of contracts. With the API, you can leverage Concord's features in a programmatic way, allowing for integration with external systems and automation of workflows. Using Pipedream, you can connect Concord's capabilities to a multitude of other services, trigger workflows based on events within Concord, or perform operations in Concord in response to triggers from other apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Contract Creation**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that listens for new deal records in a CRM like Salesforce. When a new deal is confirmed, use the Concord API to automatically generate a contract based on pre-defined templates and send it to the relevant parties for signing.

- **Contract Approval Workflow**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers whenever a contract is updated in Concord. The workflow will check if a contract has reached a certain stage, then notify a Slack channel or a specific approver via email, requesting their review or approval before the next stage.

- **Sync Contracts with Cloud Storage**: Develop a Pipedream workflow that triggers on the completion of a contract's signing process in Concord. The signed contract can be automatically uploaded to a cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox, ensuring that all contracts are securely stored and easily accessible.
