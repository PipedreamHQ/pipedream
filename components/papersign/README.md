# Overview

The Papersign API allows you to automate electronic signature processes, making it easier to manage document signing workflows. With this API, you can create, send, and manage documents for signature, track the status of sent documents, and integrate e-signature workflows directly into your existing business processes via Pipedream. This can significantly reduce the time and effort involved in manual document handling, ensuring faster turnaround times and improved compliance with signing procedures.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Deployment for New Clients**: When a new client is onboarded, automatically generate and send a custom contract for signature. Use data from CRM platforms like Salesforce to populate the contract details, ensuring each document is personalized and accurate. Once signed, the contract can be stored automatically in cloud storage solutions like Google Drive or Dropbox.

- **HR Onboarding Document Handling**: Streamline the HR onboarding process by automatically sending employment agreements and policy documents to new hires. Connect Papersign with an HR management system like BambooHR. When a new employee record is created, trigger the sending of all necessary documents for signature. Completed documents can be automatically uploaded to the employee's record for easy access and compliance.

- **Real Estate Closing Document Workflow**: Automate the sending of real estate closing documents to buyers and sellers. Integrate Papersign with real estate management software. When a property status updates to 'pending close,' automatically send out closing documents to all relevant parties for signature. Upon completion, update the property records and notify agents and clients via email or SMS through integrations with communication tools like Twilio or Sendgrid.
