# Overview

The Papersign API allows users to automate and manage electronic signatures and document workflows seamlessly. With this API, you can create, send, and track documents that require signatures, automate follow-ups, and integrate e-signature processes into your broader business systems. Using Pipedream, these capabilities can be enhanced by connecting Papersign with other apps to streamline operations, from HR onboarding to legal document handling.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Workflow**: Automate the process of sending out contracts once a new client is added to your CRM. When a new client is registered in Salesforce, trigger a workflow in Pipedream that generates a contract in Papersign, sends it to the client for signature, and updates the CRM with the status of the contract.

- **Onboarding Paperwork Automation**: Streamline employee onboarding by triggering document workflows when a new employee is added to your HR system, such as BambooHR. Use Pipedream to automatically send employment forms through Papersign for signature, then store signed documents in a service like Google Drive and update the HR system to reflect completion.

- **Legal Document Approval and Archive**: For legal teams needing to manage document approvals, set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers when a new document is uploaded to a SharePoint folder. The workflow could automatically send the document through Papersign for necessary signatures and, once completed, archive the signed version in a specified secure storage like Box.
