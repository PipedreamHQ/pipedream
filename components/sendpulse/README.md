# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Subscriber Onboarding**: As soon as a user signs up on your platform, trigger a workflow that adds them to a specific mailing list in SendPulse. Then, automatically send a personalized welcome email series to guide them through your product's features.

- **Behavior-Driven Email Campaigns**: Connect SendPulse with your e-commerce platform. When a customer abandons their cart, initiate an automated email via SendPulse that reminds them of their incomplete purchase and offers a discount to incentivize completion.

- **Lead Qualification and Nurturing**: Integrate SendPulse with a form submission tool like Typeform. Upon receiving a new form entry, add the contact to SendPulse and use lead scoring to segment the contact into the appropriate email campaign for nurturing.
