# Overview

The Affinda API offers a suite of powerful tools for document analysis and extraction, enabling you to automate the processing of resumes, invoices, bank statements, and other documents. By parsing detailed information from documents, Affinda can transform unstructured data into structured, actionable insights. With Pipedream, you can integrate Affinda's capabilities into serverless workflows, connecting to hundreds of apps to automate tasks like candidate screening, financial data aggregation, or content management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Resume Screening Automation**: Process incoming resumes by triggering a Pipedream workflow with an email attachment or a new file in a cloud storage service. Use Affinda to analyze the resume data, then enrich and filter the candidates based on skills and experience, automatically populating a Google Sheets spreadsheet or a Trello board for review.

- **Invoice Processing and Reconciliation**: Automatically process invoices received via email or a dedicated folder in Dropbox. The Affinda API extracts invoice data, which you can then use in Pipedream to match against purchase orders in an ERP system like QuickBooks, flag discrepancies, and update the payment status, streamlining the accounts payable process.

- **Bank Statement Analysis for Financial Reporting**: When new bank statements are uploaded to a shared drive, trigger a Pipedream workflow to extract transaction data with Affinda. Analyze spending patterns, categorize transactions, and feed the structured data into financial reporting tools such as Xero or an internal database, aiding in the creation of comprehensive financial reports.
