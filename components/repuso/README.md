# Overview

Repuso is a dynamic tool that aggregates customer reviews from various sources, enabling businesses to monitor and showcase real-time user testimonials on their websites or through other digital channels. By using the Repuso API on Pipedream, developers can automate the collection, management, and display of these reviews, as well as integrate these functionalities with other business applications for enhanced data-driven decision making and improved customer engagement.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Review Collection and Notification**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream where Repuso monitors multiple platforms for new customer reviews. Once a new review is detected, automatically send a notification via Slack or email to the business team. This ensures that the team is promptly informed of customer feedback and can react quickly to both positive and negative reviews.

- **Sync Reviews with CRM**: Automatically sync new reviews collected by Repuso with a CRM system like Salesforce or HubSpot. Each time a new review is fetched, it can be added as a new entry in the CRM, linked to the corresponding customer profile. This integration helps sales and support teams stay informed about customer sentiments and tailor their interactions accordingly.

- **Generate Monthly Review Reports**: Create a monthly workflow on Pipedream that compiles all reviews collected via Repuso, summarizes them, and generates a detailed report using Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. This report could include metrics like overall rating, sentiment analysis, and common themes from customer feedback. The report can then be automatically emailed to stakeholders to inform business strategies and customer service improvements.
