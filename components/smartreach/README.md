# Overview

The SmartReach API integrates with Pipedream to enable automated workflows for email outreach and sales engagement. Within Pipedream, users can harness SmartReach's capabilities to create, update, track, and manage email campaigns, prospects, and templates. This allows for sophisticated outreach strategies that react to events in real-time, such as incoming emails, link clicks, or replied-to messages, and connect these events with other apps to streamline sales and marketing efforts.

# Example Use Cases

- **Syncing New Prospects from CRM to SmartReach**: Automatically add new contacts from a CRM platform like Salesforce to a SmartReach campaign. When a new contact is created in Salesforce, Pipedream triggers a workflow that adds the contact to a specified SmartReach campaign, ensuring no prospect is missed.

- **Automating Follow-Ups Based on Prospect Engagement**: Use Pipedream to monitor prospect engagement with emails sent through SmartReach. If a prospect clicks a link or opens an email multiple times, trigger a follow-up email or task creation in a connected tool like Trello or Asana to engage the hot lead promptly.

- **Maintaining Email List Hygiene**: Keep your SmartReach email lists clean by automating the process of removing bounced emails or unsubscribes. Connect SmartReach to an email verification service like Hunter. When Hunter flags an email as invalid or an unsubscribe is detected, Pipedream can remove the contact from your SmartReach lists.
