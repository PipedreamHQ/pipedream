# Overview

Zonka Feedback API allows for the collection and management of customer feedback data. Through Pipedream, you can automate the process of capturing this feedback, analyze the data for insights, and integrate with other services to act on the information collected. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create complex workflows that trigger actions in other apps, based on feedback received, without writing extensive code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Feedback Analysis and Reporting**: Set up a workflow that triggers whenever new feedback is received via Zonka. Automatically analyze the sentiment of the feedback using a natural language processing service like Google Cloud Natural Language API. Summarize the results and send a weekly report via email with Gmail or SMTP by Pipedream.

- **Real-time Feedback Notification**: Create a workflow that immediately notifies the customer service team on Slack or sends an SMS via Twilio when a customer leaves negative feedback. This enables your team to take swift action, potentially turning a negative experience into a positive one.

- **Feedback-Driven Task Creation**: Construct a workflow that creates a new task in a project management tool like Trello or Asana when specific feedback criteria are met. For example, if feedback mentions a bug or feature request, automatically create a card or task so the product team can prioritize it in their workflow.
