# Overview

On Pipedream, you can leverage the PostgreSQL app to create workflows that automate database operations, synchronize data across platforms, and react to database events in real-time. Think handling new row entries, updating records from webhooks, or even compiling reports on a set schedule. Pipedream's serverless platform provides a powerful way to connect PostgreSQL with a variety of apps, enabling you to create tailored automation that fits your specific needs.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-time Data Sync**: Keep your PostgreSQL database in sync with another data store, like Google Sheets. Each time a new row is added to a PostgreSQL table, a Pipedream workflow can insert the corresponding data into a Google Sheet, ensuring that your team has access to the latest information without manual updates.

- **Automated Backups**: Set up a workflow that triggers on a schedule to perform database backups. The workflow could export data from selected PostgreSQL tables and save them to a cloud storage platform like Dropbox or Google Drive, providing regular and reliable backups without manual intervention.

- **Event-Driven Notifications**: Create a Pipedream workflow that watches for specific changes in your PostgreSQL database, such as a new customer sign-up or reaching a stock threshold. Upon detecting the change, it can send a notification through platforms like Slack or email, keeping relevant stakeholders informed instantly and facilitating timely responses.
