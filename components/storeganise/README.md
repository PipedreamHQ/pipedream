# Overview

The Storeganise API allows for comprehensive management of valet storage operations, enabling users to automate tasks such as customer management, billing, and inventory tracking. By integrating this API with Pipedream, users can create custom workflows that respond to events in Storeganise, orchestrate data flows, and connect with hundreds of other apps to streamline storage operations, enhance customer experiences, and optimize business processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Onboarding**: When a new customer signs up via your platform, use the Storeganise API in Pipedream to create a new customer record, initiate a welcome email sequence through Mailchimp, and schedule an initial pickup through a logistics app like Easyship.

- **Dynamic Billing Updates**: Set up a workflow that listens for updates in storage usage per customer on Storeganise, calculates the updated billing amount, and automatically updates the invoice in accounting software like QuickBooks. This ensures billing is always accurate and reflects real-time storage usage.

- **Inventory Alerts System**: Create a workflow that monitors item counts and triggers alerts via Slack or email when inventory levels fall below a certain threshold. This can help prevent stockouts and ensure timely reordering or allocation adjustments.
