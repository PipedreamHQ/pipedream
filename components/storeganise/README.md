# Overview

The Storeganise API enables automation and integration for businesses in the valet storage domain, offering functionalities to manage customers, orders, items, and billing. With this API, you can streamline storage operations, improve customer interactions, and enhance the reporting capabilities by automating data flow between Storeganise and other platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Onboarding**: - When a new customer signs up via a form on your website (using services like Typeform or Google Forms), trigger a Pipedream workflow that captures the customer data and automatically creates a new customer profile in Storeganise. This can include setting up initial preferences, storage requirements, and preliminary billing details.

- **Inventory Management Sync**: - Set up a workflow where inventory updates in Storeganise are automatically synced to a Google Sheets document. This helps in maintaining an up-to-date view of inventory levels, storage conditions, and item specifics that can be shared easily with team members or used for reporting purposes.

- **Automated Billing and Invoicing**: - Implement a workflow where once a billing period is over, Storeganise triggers an event in Pipedream that calculates the total cost based on stored items and duration, and then uses Stripe to generate and send invoices to customers. This process ensures timely and accurate billing, reducing manual errors and improving financial operations.
