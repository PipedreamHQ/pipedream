# Overview

The Mailbox Power API enables personalized direct mail campaigns by automating the sending of physical mail, gifts, and greeting cards. This can be orchestrated directly from Pipedream's platform, leveraging the ease of serverless workflows. With this API, one can create targeted, personalized mail pieces on the fly, manage contacts, and track sent items, all programmatically. The integration potential on Pipedream also allows for syncing Mailbox Power with CRM systems, triggering mail sends based on customer actions or dates, and analyzing the impact of direct mail campaigns in conjunction with digital marketing tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **CRM Lead Engagement**: When a new lead is added to a CRM like Salesforce, automatically trigger a Mailbox Power workflow to send a personalized welcome postcard. This nurtures the lead with a tangible touchpoint.

- **Customer Birthdays and Anniversaries**: Connect Mailbox Power with a database like Airtable or Google Sheets, where customer birthdays or anniversaries are stored. Set up a Pipedream workflow that sends a personalized card or gift on these special dates to enhance customer loyalty.

- **E-commerce Order Follow-up**: After an order status changes to 'Delivered' in an e-commerce platform like Shopify, use Pipedream to trigger Mailbox Power to mail a thank-you note or a discount offer for future purchases, enriching the post-purchase experience.
