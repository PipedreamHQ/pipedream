# Example Use Cases

- **User Segmentation and Email Campaigns**: Synchronize CleverTap segments to an email marketing service like Mailchimp using Pipedream. When a new segment is created in CleverTap, automatically add these users to Mailchimp and trigger a tailored email campaign.

- **Real-Time User Activity Alerts**: Send instant notifications to Slack when a high-value user performs a specific action in your app. Pipedream can listen for CleverTap webhook events and post messages to a Slack channel, keeping your team updated on critical user engagements.

- **Automated User Onboarding**: Create a workflow where new users added to CleverTap trigger a series of welcome messages via Twilio. Pipedream can capture the event, and use Twilio to send SMS or WhatsApp messages, making the onboarding process smooth and personal.
