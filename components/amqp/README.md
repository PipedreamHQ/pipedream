With the AMQP API, you can build a variety of applications that perform message-oriented middleware tasks, such as reliable messaging, queuing, and publish/subscribe routing. Here are a few examples:

- A system that allows applications to communicate with each other using publish/subscribe topics
- A queuing system that allows applications to put messages into queues and process them later
