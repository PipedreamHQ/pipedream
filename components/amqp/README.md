# Overview

With the AMQP API, you can build a variety of applications that perform
message-oriented middleware tasks, such as reliable messaging, queuing, and
publish/subscribe routing. Here are a few examples:

- A messaging system that allows applications to communicate with each other
  using message queues
- A system that allows applications to communicate with each other using
  publish/subscribe topics
- A queuing system that allows applications to put messages into queues and
  process them later
