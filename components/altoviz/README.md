# Overview

The Altoviz API offers access to a range of data visualization tools that allow users to create, manage, and embed interactive charts and maps into their applications. With Pipedream, you can leverage this functionality to automate the generation of custom visualizations based on various data sources and events. You can trigger workflows using webhooks, schedule them, or even react to emails and messages, and then use the Altoviz API to dynamically create data visualizations that can be shared with your audience or team.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Reporting**: Set up a workflow that triggers at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly) to fetch data from a database or API, such as Google Sheets or SQL, and use the Altoviz API to generate a visualization. This visualization can then be emailed to stakeholders or posted to a team channel in Slack, keeping everyone updated with the latest metrics.

- **Real-time Dashboard Updates**: Create a real-time dashboard by deploying a webhook-triggered Pipedream workflow that listens for data updates from your app. Each time new data comes in, use Altoviz API to refresh the visualization on your dashboard, providing up-to-the-minute insights for users or customers.

- **Integrating User Feedback into Visuals**: Implement a workflow that captures user feedback via a form submission or a support ticket system like Zendesk. Analyze the feedback data, categorize it, and use the Altoviz API to update a public-facing visualization that tracks customer satisfaction or product improvement over time.
