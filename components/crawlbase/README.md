# Overview

The Crawlbase API provides powerful tools for web scraping and data extraction from any webpage. It handles large-scale data collection tasks, bypassing bot protection and CAPTCHAs, and returning structured data. Within Pipedream, you can leverage Crawlbase to automate the harvesting of web data, integrate scraped content with other services, and process it for analysis, reporting, or triggering other workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Aggregation**: Extract content from various online sources and aggregate it for a news digest or market research. You could use Crawlbase to scrape articles, blog posts, or product listings, then send the results to Google Sheets using Pipedream's Google Sheets integration for easy organization and analysis.

- **E-commerce Price Monitoring**: Set up a workflow that regularly scrapes competitor websites for product pricing using Crawlbase. Process the scraped data in Pipedream to find pricing patterns or changes, and automatically adjust your own pricing on Shopify or alert your sales team via Slack if competitors change their prices.

- **SEO Monitoring**: Monitor changes in content and meta tags on your own or competitors' web pages to inform SEO strategies. Crawlbase can capture relevant data points, and Pipedream can forward this information to an SEO tool like Moz or Ahrefs for further analysis, or log it in a data store for tracking over time.
