# Overview

Linear helps streamline software project management, bug tracking, and task coordination. By using the Linear (API key) API with Pipedream, you can automate routine tasks, sync issues across platforms, and trigger custom workflows. Think auto-assignment of tasks based on specific triggers or pushing updates to a Slack channel when an issue's status changes. These automations save time and ensure that your development team stays focused on coding rather than on administrative overhead.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Issues with Google Sheets**: Use Pipedream to monitor new issues in Linear and automatically add them to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This can help with reporting, auditing, and providing a high-level overview of tasks without needing to access Linear directly.

- **Automate Task Assignment Based on Labels**: When a new issue is created in Linear with a specific label (e.g., "urgent"), you can set up a Pipedream workflow to automatically assign it to a designated team member or escalate it by creating a high-priority notification in your team's messaging app, like Slack or Microsoft Teams.

- **Create GitHub Issues from Linear Tasks**: For development teams using both Linear and GitHub, a workflow can be set up to create a new GitHub issue whenever a Linear task reaches a certain stage or is tagged for development. This ensures that your code repository is always in sync with your project management tool.
