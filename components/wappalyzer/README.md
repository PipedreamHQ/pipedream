# Overview

The Wappalyzer API lets you uncover the technology stack of any website. On Pipedream, you can integrate this capability into workflows to automate tech stack detection. Here's what you can do: identify the software used by your competitors, track technology adoption, and get insights into your target market's tech preferences. By leveraging Pipedream's robust platform, you can connect Wappalyzer with other services to create custom workflows that trigger actions based on the tech stack data you collect.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Generation for Web Development Services**: Detect tech stacks of potential leads' websites. If a site uses outdated frameworks, trigger an email through the SendGrid app, offering your services to modernize their web presence.

- **Market Research Automation**: Schedule daily checks on top industry websites, capture their tech stacks, and save the data in a Google Sheets spreadsheet for trend analysis and report generation.

- **Competitor Monitoring Alert System**: Monitor competitor websites for tech stack changes. Use Pipedream's built-in Cron Scheduler to run the workflow weekly, and if new technologies are detected, post a notification in a Slack channel to keep your team informed.
