# Overview

The Droxy API enables the construction of powerful serverless workflows on Pipedream, tapping into Droxy's capability to manage Docker containers. You can automate container lifecycle, pull statistics, and handle dynamic scaling based on real-time data. Pipedream's robust platform supports connecting to countless services which means you can integrate Droxy with other apps to facilitate CI/CD pipelines, application monitoring, or even chatbot notifications for container status updates.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Development Environment Setup**: Create a workflow that listens for GitHub `push` events. When a developer pushes to a specific branch, trigger the workflow to deploy a fresh Docker container with the latest codebase using Droxy, then run integration tests automatically.

- **Dynamic Resource Scaling**: Set up a workflow that monitors resource usage stats from Droxy. If the usage crosses a threshold, the workflow can scale up or down the number of containers accordingly, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

- **Notification System for Container Health**: Build a workflow that periodically checks the health of containers via Droxy API. If a container is down or unhealthy, the workflow triggers an alert and sends a notification through Slack or sends an email via SendGrid, keeping the team updated instantly.
