# Overview

The Campayn API lets you automate email marketing tasks directly within Pipedream. It provides programmatic access to manage contacts, lists, and email campaigns. With Pipedream, you can build serverless workflows to integrate Campayn with other apps and services, triggering actions based on events, scheduling regular email campaigns, or syncing data across platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Contact Syncing**: Create a workflow that synchronizes contacts between Campayn and your CRM system. Whenever a new contact is added in your CRM, the workflow can automatically add or update the contact in your designated Campayn list.

- **Email Campaign Triggered by E-Commerce Events**: Set up a workflow that sends targeted email campaigns through Campayn when a customer makes a purchase, abandons a cart, or performs a significant action on your e-commerce platform.

- **Periodic Campaign Performance Reports**: Develop a workflow that fetches campaign performance data from Campayn on a regular basis and compiles it into a report using Google Sheets or a data visualization tool, then sends the report via email or Slack to your marketing team.
