# Overview

Tiledesk API enables developers to enhance and automate customer support interactions by integrating with Tiledesk's messaging and support ticket management system. Using Pipedream, you can trigger workflows based on specific events in Tiledesk, such as new messages or ticket status updates, and connect these events to actions in other apps to streamline support processes, analyze customer interactions, and improve response times.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Slack Notifications for High-Priority Tickets**: Set up a workflow where any high-priority support ticket created in Tiledesk automatically sends a notification to a designated Slack channel. This ensures immediate attention from your team and swift action to resolve critical issues.

- **Sync Support Tickets with a Google Sheets Database**: Automatically add new Tiledesk tickets to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This workflow can help retain a log of all tickets, facilitating data analysis and reporting, which can be crucial for tracking support performance and identifying common issues.

- **Customer Feedback Collection via Email**: When a ticket is marked as resolved in Tiledesk, trigger an automated email to the customer asking for feedback. Use Gmail or any SMTP service to send the email, and structure it to include a link to a feedback form. This workflow aids in collecting valuable customer insights and improving the support process.
