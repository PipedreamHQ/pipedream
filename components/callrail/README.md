# Overview

The CallRail API provides access to data about calls, texts, and form submissions that flow through the CallRail system. Leveraging Pipedream's serverless platform, you can automate workflows triggered by these events. For instance, you can log calls to a Google Sheet, create real-time alerts, or sync call data with a CRM like Salesforce.

# Example Use Cases

- **Call Logging to Google Sheets**: When new calls are tracked in CallRail, use Pipedream to append the call details to a Google Sheet. This can help you maintain records, analyze call data, or share insights with your team.

- **Real-time SMS Alerts for Missed Calls**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that monitors your CallRail account for missed calls and instantly sends an SMS alert via Twilio, ensuring you can follow up promptly.

- **CRM Integration for Call Tracking**: Automatically add CallRail call details to Salesforce as new leads or activities. This streamlines your sales process by keeping your CRM updated with the latest call interactions.
