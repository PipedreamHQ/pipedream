# Overview

The IQAir AirVisual API provides access to air quality data from around the world, including real-time pollution levels, forecasts, and historical data. With this data at your fingertips on Pipedream, you can build tailored automations that respond to air quality changes. Imagine triggering notifications, adjusting smart home settings, or compiling analytical reportsâ€”all based on accurate environmental insights.

# Example Use Cases

- **Smart Home Air Quality Adjustment**: Automatically control air purifiers and HVAC systems in a smart home setup. When the API reports poor air quality levels in your area, trigger an IoT device to turn on or adjust settings, ensuring clean indoor air.

- **Health Alert System**: Create a personal health alert system for those with respiratory conditions. Set up a workflow that monitors air quality levels and sends alerts via SMS or email when they reach a threshold that could affect health.

- **Environmental Data Reporting**: Generate regular environmental reports for a specific location. Schedule a Pipedream workflow to retrieve weekly or monthly air quality data from the API and compile it into a report, which can be saved to Google Drive or sent to a list of subscribers via an email service like SendGrid.
