# Overview

The WeSupply API serves as a bridge connecting your ecommerce platforms to WeSupply's order tracking and logistics features. By utilizing the API within Pipedream, you unlock the potential to automate order updates, streamline returns, and enhance customer service interactions. Pipedream's serverless platform allows you to create workflows that trigger based on certain events, process data, and connect to countless other APIs and servicesâ€”essentially turning your WeSupply data into actionable insights and automated tasks without the need for a dedicated backend infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Order Status Sync to Customer Support Platform**: Integrate WeSupply with a customer support platform like Zendesk. When an order status updates in WeSupply, the workflow triggers, fetching the order details and updating the corresponding support ticket in Zendesk. This keeps your support team and customers informed about the latest shipping updates or delays.

- **Returns Processing Automation**: Automate the returns process by connecting WeSupply to an email service like SendGrid. When a return is initiated in WeSupply, Pipedream triggers a workflow that sends an email with a return label and instructions, streamlining the return process for customers and reducing manual work for your team.

- **Inventory Level Webhook Notifications**: Pair WeSupply with Slack for real-time inventory updates. Set up a workflow where low inventory levels in WeSupply send an alert to a designated Slack channel. This helps your procurement team stay on top of stock levels and react promptly to avoid stockouts.
