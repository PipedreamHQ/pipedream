# Overview

The Sensibo API provides programmatic access to Sensibo's smart air conditioning features, allowing you to control and monitor your climate devices. By integrating the Sensibo API with Pipedream, you can automate climate control, receive updates on environmental conditions, and interact with other apps for a smarter home or office setup. Create workflows that respond to triggers such as temperature changes, time schedules, or other app events, and manage your AC units efficiently.

# Example Use Cases

- **Smart Temperature Control**: Adjust your AC settings based on real-time temperature data from a weather API. If the outside temperature exceeds your comfort zone, Pipedream can trigger your Sensibo device to cool or heat your space before you arrive.

- **Energy Saving Routine**: Create a workflow that turns off your Sensibo-controlled AC units during peak energy consumption hours. Link it with your calendar to ensure the AC is on only when meetings are scheduled in your smart office.

- **Voice-Controlled AC**: Integrate Sensibo with a voice assistant platform like Google Assistant. Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for voice commands and adjusts your AC settings accordingly, offering a hands-free way to manage your environment.
