# Overview

The Salesmate API enables automation of CRM-related tasks within the Salesmate platform. By leveraging this API on Pipedream, you can craft serverless workflows that interact with Salesmate data, such as contacts, deals, and activities. This allows for seamless integration of Salesmate with other services to enhance sales processes, enable real-time data updates, and trigger custom actions based on specific events within your CRM.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Contacts to Mailchimp:** When a new contact is added to Salesmate, automatically add them to a designated Mailchimp list. This keeps your email marketing lists up to date without manual entry, ensuring new leads receive your campaigns.

- **Create Deals from Shopify Orders:** Once an order is placed in Shopify, create a corresponding deal in Salesmate. This workflow can help track new sales opportunities and maintain alignment between your e-commerce platform and sales pipeline.

- **Slack Notifications for Deal Milestones:** Send a message to a specific Slack channel whenever a deal in Salesmate reaches a key milestone or is won. This encourages team awareness and timely celebration of sales achievements.
