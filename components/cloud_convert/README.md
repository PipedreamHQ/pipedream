# Example Use Cases

- **Bulk Document Conversion**: Automatically convert a batch of documents from Google Drive to PDF whenever a new file is added to a specific folder. Utilize Pipedream's Google Drive integration to monitor the folder and trigger the Cloud Convert API to perform the conversion, then save the PDFs back to Google Drive.

- **Image Optimization for Web**: Create a workflow where high-resolution images uploaded to Dropbox are automatically optimized for web use by converting them to a compressed format with Cloud Convert. After conversion, use Pipedream to upload the optimized images to a content delivery network like Amazon S3 for fast and efficient web serving.

- **Audio/Video Transcoding for Social Media**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that takes newly recorded podcasts or videos from a platform like Zoom, transcodes them into formats suitable for social media platforms using Cloud Convert, and then posts the media to YouTube or SoundCloud. This streamlines the process of sharing content across various channels.
