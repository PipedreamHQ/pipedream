# Overview

The Userflow API allows you to automate and integrate the process of creating and managing in-app guides and walkthroughs. Using the API within Pipedream, you can programmatically trigger events, update user attributes, and manage flows, thereby creating a personalized user experience within your application. This opens up possibilities for syncing user data, customizing user onboarding experiences, and tracking user progress without manual intervention.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync User Data from CRM to Userflow**: Automatically update user attributes in Userflow when a contact is updated in your CRM system like Hubspot or Salesforce. This keeps user data consistent across platforms and ensures personalized onboarding flows are based on the latest user information.

- **Trigger Onboarding Flows Based on User Behavior**: Start a specific Userflow guide when a user performs a certain action within your app. For instance, if a user adds their first item to the cart in an e-commerce app, trigger a guide on how to complete their purchase.

- **Track User Progress and Send Custom Notifications**: Monitor user progress through onboarding flows and send custom notifications or emails via apps like SendGrid or Twilio when they reach certain milestones. This can encourage users to fully engage with your app and provide additional support as needed.
