# Overview

SupportBee's API hooks into its customer support ticketing system, allowing for programmatic ticket management, reporting, and collaboration. With Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate responses, escalate issues based on keywords, or sync with other tools to streamline your support workflow.

# Example Use Cases

- **Auto-Response to Common Queries**: Use Pipedream to listen for new tickets with specific phrases and automatically respond with canned answers or helpful resources, cutting down the initial response time.

- **Ticket Escalation via Sentiment Analysis**: Connect SupportBee to a sentiment analysis service. If a ticket's sentiment score is negative, trigger a workflow on Pipedream that prioritizes the ticket and notifies the appropriate team or manager.

- **Sync Support Tickets with a CRM**: Automatically create or update customer profiles in a CRM like Salesforce whenever a new ticket is received or resolved in SupportBee, ensuring the sales team is up-to-date on customer issues.
