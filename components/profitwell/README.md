- **Customer Lifecycle Email Campaigns**: Use ProfitWell's API to feed customer subscription data into Mailchimp via Pipedream. Automate a sequence of emails that target customers at different stages of their lifecycle, such as onboarding sequences for new signups or win-back campaigns for those who are at risk of churning.
