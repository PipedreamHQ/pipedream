# Overview

Shorten.REST API on Pipedream allows you to automate URL shortening, expanding, and tracking within your custom workflows. With this API, you can create short, branded links programmatically, obtain detailed analytics on click-throughs, and manage your URLs efficiently, all within Pipedream's serverless platform. This enables seamless integration of URL management into your applications, marketing campaigns, or day-to-day tasks while leveraging various triggers and actions from other apps available on Pipedream.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Link Shortening for Social Media Posts**: Post to platforms like Twitter or Facebook with shortened links. Whenever a new blog post goes live on your CMS, use Pipedream to trigger a workflow that shortens the URL and posts an update with the shortened link to your social media accounts.

- **Dynamic QR Code Generation for Events**: Create QR codes for event tickets or promotions. When a user registers for an event on Eventbrite, Pipedream can catch the webhook, shorten the event URL, and generate a QR code using Shorten.REST API, which can then be emailed to the attendee.

- **Link Analytics Integration with Google Sheets**: Collect and analyze click data on your short links. Each time a short link is clicked, Pipedream can log the click data to a Google Sheet, allowing you to track performance and engagement over time without manual entry.
