# Overview

GPTZero: Detect AI API lets you determine if a piece of text was likely generated by AI. With the increasing prevalence of AI-written content, this tool can be useful for authenticity checks in various fields such as education, content creation, and journalism. On Pipedream, you can automate workflows to screen content, flag AI-generated texts, or integrate checks into user-generated content systems.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Verification in Educational Platforms**: Automatically scan student submissions using GPTZero to detect potential AI-generated content. Connect with platforms like Google Classroom or Moodle to fetch assignments, run them through the GPTZero API, and flag submissions that might require further review.

- **Enhanced Moderation for Online Forums**: Integrate GPTZero with community platforms like Discourse or Reddit. Automatically analyze posts and comments for AI-generated content, helping maintain authenticity and reduce spam or misleading information.

- **AI Content Detection in Publishing**: For publishers and content managers, set up a workflow where articles submitted through CMS (like WordPress) are checked with GPTZero before publication. This helps ensure that all published content is genuine and maintains editorial standards.
