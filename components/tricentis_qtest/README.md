# Overview

The Tricentis qTest API offers a powerful interface for managing and automating various aspects of software testing workflows. Through the API, users can create, update, retrieve, and delete resources like projects, test cases, and defects, enabling deep integration with testing lifecycle management. When used with Pipedream, these capabilities can be extended to automate interactions between qTest and other tools, streamlining testing processes, syncing data across platforms, and triggering actions based on test outcomes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Defect Reporting**  
  Automatically create a defect in qTest when a test fails in a CI/CD pipeline like Jenkins or CircleCI. This can include sending detailed test results and logs to qTest to provide context for the defect, improving response times and traceability.

- **Test Case Synchronization**  
  Sync test cases from qTest to project management tools like Jira or Trello whenever a new test case is added or updated in qTest. This ensures that all team members have visibility into test requirements and statuses, enhancing collaboration across teams.

- **Real-Time Notifications**  
  Send real-time notifications via Slack or email when critical tests fail or defects are marked as high priority in qTest. This helps teams immediately address issues that may impact release schedules or application quality.
