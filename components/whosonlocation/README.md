# Overview

The WhosOnLocation API allows you to manage and track people's presence in various locations, such as office buildings, worksites, and campuses. In Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create automations that streamline visitor management, employee attendance, and emergency roll-calls. By crafting serverless workflows, you can respond to events in real-time, synchronize data with other systems, and enhance security and compliance processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Visitor Registration Automation**: Automate the visitor sign-in process by integrating WhosOnLocation with Pipedream. Create a workflow that triggers when a visitor fills out a form in your preferred app, such as Typeform. The workflow captures the submission, registers the visitor in WhosOnLocation, and can even send personalized entry instructions via email or SMS through integrations with SendGrid or Twilio.

- **Real-Time Occupancy Alerting**: Set up a workflow that monitors the number of people on-site using WhosOnLocation's API. When occupancy levels hit certain thresholds, Pipedream can trigger notifications to Slack to inform facilities managers in real-time. This ensures that safety and social distancing regulations are adhered to and allows for swift action when needed.

- **Emergency Roll-Call Check-In**: In emergencies, quickly account for everyone's safety with a workflow that interfaces with WhosOnLocation during an evacuation. The workflow could be configured to send an automated message via an app like Twilio to all individuals on-site, asking them to check in. Responses are then collected and updated in WhosOnLocation, helping emergency responders and company officials to track everyone's status efficiently.
