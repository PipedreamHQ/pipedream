# Overview

The Degreed API enables automated interactions with the Degreed platform, a hub for professional growth and learning. Through this API, you can programmatically access user data, learning content, pathways, and more. By leveraging Pipedream, users can design custom workflows that integrate Degreed's learning management capabilities with other services to streamline processes, report on progress, sync data across platforms, and even curate learning content based on specific triggers or criteria.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Learning Progress Reports**: Send weekly learning progress reports from Degreed to Slack. Utilize the Degreed API to gather user progress and then create a formatted message sent to a designated Slack channel to keep teams updated on their learning milestones.

- **Content Completion Trigger for Certificates**: When a user completes a learning path in Degreed, trigger a workflow in Pipedream that generates a certificate in Canva and emails it to the user via SendGrid. This workflow enables automatic recognition of user achievements, enhancing motivation and engagement.

- **Cross-Platform Learning Path Synchronization**: Sync learning paths between Degreed and an internal company wiki or LMS like Moodle. When a new learning path is created in Degreed, the Pipedream workflow detects the change and updates the company's internal platforms, ensuring that all learning resources are consistently available across all systems.
