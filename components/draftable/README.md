# Overview

The Draftable API provides a powerful platform for comparing documents programmatically. Leverage this API via Pipedream to automate the comparison of text files, enabling quick and accurate detection of differences between versions. Whether you're tracking changes in legal contracts, software documentation, or manuscript revisions, integrating Draftable with Pipedream can streamline your comparison workflows, triggering actions in other apps based on the results.

# Example Use Cases

- **Contract Change Detection & Notification**: Automate a workflow that triggers whenever a new version of a contract is uploaded to a cloud storage service like Dropbox. Use Draftable to compare the new contract with the previous version and, if changes are detected, send an alert through Slack or email to the relevant parties.

- **Version Control for Documentation**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that subscribes to GitHub commits on documentation repos. Utilize Draftable to compare the updated documentation with the existing one. If significant changes are found, automatically update the documentation on your website and notify your support team via a tool like Zendesk.

- **Manuscript Revision Tracking for Publishers**: Create a workflow where manuscript revisions uploaded to Google Drive trigger a comparison with the previous draft using Draftable. If changes surpass a certain threshold, send the comparison result to the editorial team and update the project management tool, such as Trello or Asana, to signal that the manuscript is ready for the next stage of review.
