# Overview

The Draftable API enables developers to convert documents and images into
highly-compressed, draft versions that can be easily shared and reviewed. This
can be useful for a number of different applications, such as:

- Collaborative document editing, where users can quickly add comments and
  suggestions without slowing down the download or editing process
- Document sharing, where users can quickly share large documents without
  overloading email servers or bandwidth limits
- Image compression, where users can quickly reduce the size of images without
  losing quality or resolution
