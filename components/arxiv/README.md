# Overview

The arXiv API provides programmatic access to the vast repository of electronic preprints and publications in various fields of science and academia. Leveraging this API within Pipedream allows you to automate workflows involving scholarly communication, such as tracking new publications in specific domains, analyzing research trends, or notifying collaborators about recent papers. Pipedream's serverless platform can trigger actions based on new submissions to arXiv, process metadata, and connect with other apps to create powerful integrations for researchers and data enthusiasts.

# Example Use Cases

- **Daily Research Digest**: Build a workflow that fetches the latest papers from a selected arXiv category every day and sends a digest to your email. This keeps you updated on recent publications without manual searching.

- **New Paper Alert**: Set up a real-time notification system that monitors arXiv for new papers from specific authors or keywords. When a new paper matches your criteria, receive an alert through Slack or another messaging platform.

- **Literature Review Automation**: Create a workflow that compiles new papers related to your research into a Google Sheets document, including titles, authors, and abstracts. This can serve as an auto-updating literature review to aid in research projects.
