# Overview

The FormCan API enables automation and integration of FormCan form submissions into various workflows on Pipedream. With this API, you can trigger actions when new submissions come in, read and manage your forms, and interact with submitted data in real-time. This opens a plethora of possibilities to connect your FormCan data with other apps and services, streamline data processing, and enhance the overall responsiveness of your form-related operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Spreadsheet Updates**: When a new submission is received via FormCan, use the Pipedream workflow to add or update the data in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This is perfect for keeping records without manual data entry.

- **Dynamic Email Responses**: Set up a workflow where for each new FormCan submission, Pipedream sends a customized email response using SendGrid or another email service. This can be used for lead generation follow-ups, survey responses, or confirmation emails.

- **CRM Integration**: With each FormCan submission, create or update a contact in a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. This ensures your customer relationship management system stays synced with the latest form input, keeping your sales or customer service team informed.
