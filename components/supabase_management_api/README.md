# Overview

The Supabase Management API provides a powerful interface for managing your Supabase projects programmatically. This API lets you automate project setups, user management, database configurations, and more, directly interacting with Supabase to streamline operations and reduce manual overhead.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Project Setup**: Automatically create and configure new Supabase projects when a new client is onboarded in your CRM system like Salesforce. This workflow can provision databases, set up authentication settings, and initialize default schemas based on predefined templates.

- **Dynamic User Management**: Automate user role assignments and access controls in Supabase based on changes in an external HR system like BambooHR. When a user's role is updated in the HR system, reflect these changes in the Supabase project to ensure proper access and security levels are maintained.

- **Real-time Database Updates from External Events**: Sync data between Supabase and third-party APIs, such as Shopify for e-commerce. Automatically update inventory counts in Supabase whenever a sale is processed on Shopify, ensuring that the inventory levels are always up to date across platforms.
