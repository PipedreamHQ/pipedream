# Overview

Supabase Management API provides robust tools for managing your Supabase projects programmatically. With Pipedream, you can harness these capabilities to automate workflows, integrate with other services, and enhance data operations. This API lets you manage users, roles, and permissions, as well as query and manipulate project data. By automating these processes on Pipedream, you can streamline project setups, user management, and real-time data synchronization.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate User Onboarding**: Automatically add new users to your Supabase project when they sign up through your app's frontend. This can be extended by triggering welcome emails via an email platform like SendGrid or Mailgun.

- **Sync User Roles Across Platforms**: Ensure consistent user permissions by syncing role updates in Supabase with other systems like Firebase or custom admin dashboards. This can be done by monitoring role changes in Supabase and applying updates wherever necessary.

- **Real-time Database Backup**: Set up a workflow to periodically export tables from Supabase and store them in a secure location like AWS S3. This ensures data redundancy and provides a fallback in case of accidental data loss or corruption.
