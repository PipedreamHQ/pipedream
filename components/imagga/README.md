# Overview

The Imagga API is a powerful image recognition tool that enables you to automate the process of analyzing and tagging images. With its AI-driven capabilities, you can extract a wealth of information from visual content. It offers features such as categorization, color extraction, and auto-tagging, making it incredibly useful for building workflows that require image analysis.
