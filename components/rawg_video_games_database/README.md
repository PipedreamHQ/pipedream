# Overview

The RAWG Video Games Database API is a treasure trove for gaming enthusiasts and developers, offering access to a massive collection of video game data. With it, you can pull information such as game titles, ratings, platforms, and release dates. This data can power up apps or websites with rich content or be used to analyze gaming trends. Through Pipedream, you can automate data collection, trigger events based on new or updated game releases, and integrate with other services for notifications or data enrichment.

# Example Use Cases

- **Game Release Tracker**: Set up a workflow that monitors the RAWG API for new game releases and automatically posts updates to a Discord server or Slack channel dedicated to gaming news. This keeps your community informed about the latest games.

- **User Preferences Alert**: Create a system that sends personalized emails or SMS messages to users when games matching their preferences (like genre or platform) are added to the RAWG database. This can be achieved by integrating with SendGrid for email notifications or Twilio for SMS.

- **Trend Analysis Dashboard**: Implement a workflow that aggregates data from RAWG to visualize gaming trends over time. Use this data to feed into a Google Sheets or a Tableau dashboard, allowing for in-depth analysis of game popularity, platform distribution, or genre success.
