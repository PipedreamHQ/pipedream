# Overview

The ArcGIS Online API lets you work with ESRI's platform for mapping and spatial analysis. In Pipedream, harness this API to craft workflows combining GIS data management, location-based analytics, and automated mapping tasks. Pipedream's serverless architecture means you can trigger these workflows via HTTP requests, schedule them, or even fire them in response to emails or form submissions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Spatial Data Updates on Schedule**: Automate the process of updating GIS layers in ArcGIS Online by scheduling workflows in Pipedream. Fetch the latest data from an external database or API, transform it as needed, and push updates to keep maps current.

- **Incident Reporting and Mapping**: Create a workflow triggered by a form submission or email that contains location data about incidents. Pipedream can parse this data, create a new feature in an ArcGIS layer, and send notifications to relevant stakeholders with the updated map link.

- **Geo-Triggered Alerts with Twilio**: For real-time alerts based on geographic triggers, use Pipedream to monitor a dataset in ArcGIS Online for changes. If a feature enters a specified zone, automatically send an SMS via Twilio to notify personnel or customers in the affected area.
