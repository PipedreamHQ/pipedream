# Overview

The CallHub API offers programmatic access to a range of telecommunication features, such as phone banking, text messaging, and voice broadcasting. Integrating CallHub with Pipedream allows users to automate these communication services within custom workflows. With Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform, you can react to events across various apps, store and manipulate data, and trigger communications via CallHub based on user-defined criteria. This seamless integration expands the automation possibilities for campaign management, engagement tracking, and proactive notifications.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Campaign Feedback Collection**: Gather feedback from CallHub phone campaigns automatically. After a call campaign ends, trigger a workflow that collects call data, analyzes responses, and stores results in a Google Sheet for easy review.

- **SMS Subscriber Engagement**: Increase engagement with SMS subscribers. Set up a workflow to monitor a CRM like HubSpot for updated subscriber lists, and use CallHub to send personalized text messages to new or updated contacts.

- **Proactive Support Notifications**: Enhance customer support with proactive notifications. Create a workflow where a ticket creation in Zendesk triggers an informative voice message via CallHub to the customer, providing immediate acknowledgment and estimated wait times.
