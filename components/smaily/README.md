# Overview

The Smaily API allows for email marketing automation, where you can manage contacts, templates, and send out campaigns. With Pipedream's power to integrate a multitude of apps, you can craft custom workflows that react to events from various services, and then use Smaily to send targeted communications, all in a serverless environment. This seamless integration can be a game-changer for marketers seeking to enhance their audience engagement through personalized and timely emails based on user behavior or data.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Welcome Email Series**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a new user signs up via a platform like Shopify. The workflow would add the user to a specific Smaily contact list and then send a series of welcome emails that guide them through the product features or offer initial purchase discounts.

- **Survey Feedback Follow-Up**: After a customer completes a feedback survey in Typeform, use Pipedream to capture the event, analyze the feedback, and, based on their satisfaction score, trigger a personalized follow-up email via Smaily, either thanking them for positive feedback or addressing any concerns raised.

- **Event-Driven Newsletters**: Integrate with a CMS like WordPress to monitor when new content is posted. Use Pipedream to fetch the latest articles and automatically populate a Smaily newsletter template, which is then sent to subscribers, keeping them updated with fresh content.
