# Overview

The Trainual API allows you to automate processes around creating, managing, and reporting on training within your organization. With this API on Pipedream, you can build workflows for managing users, subjects, topics, tests, and more, streamlining the onboarding and continuous education processes. By integrating Trainual with other apps on Pipedream, you can create dynamic, cross-functional automations that keep your team learning in sync with other business processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Onboarding Process**: Create a workflow that triggers when a new employee is added to your HR platform like BambooHR. The workflow creates a new user in Trainual, assigns specific subjects and topics based on the role, and sends a personalized welcome email with their training plan.

- **Progress Tracking to Slack**: Set up a workflow where, whenever a user completes a topic or subject in Trainual, a notification is sent to a designated Slack channel. This keeps the team informed of each other's progress and promotes a culture of learning and achievement.

- **Monthly Training Reports**: Develop a workflow that generates monthly reports on training progress. Connect Trainual with Google Sheets to aggregate data on user completion rates, quiz scores, and time spent on training material. Automatically email this report to management to review team performance and identify areas for improvement.
