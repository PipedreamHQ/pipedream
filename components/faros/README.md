# Overview

The Faros API opens a gateway to streamline data from engineering tools into analytics-ready formats. With it, you can automate the aggregation of data from project management, source control, CI/CD, and incident management systems into Faros's unified data model. It's about turning disparate data points into actionable insights, which can lead to more informed decision-making and streamlined workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **DevOps Pipeline Monitoring**: Automate the process of tracking commits, builds, and deployments by piping data from GitHub, Jenkins, and AWS CodeDeploy (or similar services) into Faros. Gain real-time visibility into your pipeline's health and performance metrics to quickly identify and address bottlenecks.

- **Sprint Progress Tracking**: Connect Faros with project management tools like Jira. Set up a workflow that automatically fetches sprint activity and task statuses, feeding them into Faros for enhanced tracking of team velocity and sprint completion rates, aiding in agile project management.

- **Incident Response Analysis**: Integrate Faros with incident management platforms such as PagerDuty. Create a workflow to channel alerts, incident responses, and post-mortem data into Faros, providing a comprehensive view of incident impact and response effectiveness for continuous operational improvement.
