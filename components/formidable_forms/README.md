# Overview

Formidable Forms is a versatile WordPress form plugin that enables users to create complex forms and data-driven web applications. With the Formidable Forms API, developers can extend functionality, automate processes, and integrate with various services via Pipedream. This integration lets users trigger workflows based on form submissions, manipulate and route data, and connect with thousands of apps to enhance data handling and improve operational efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Entry to Google Sheets**: When a form is submitted, trigger a Pipedream workflow to extract the data and append it to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This automates data collection, making it easy to analyze, share, and store submissions without manual input.

- **Dynamic Email Notifications**: Set up a workflow that sends customized email notifications based on specific form inputs. For instance, based on the user's selections, send tailored promotional offers or critical information directly to their inbox using a service like SendGrid or Mailgun integrated through Pipedream.

- **CRM Integration for Lead Management**: Integrate Formidable Forms submissions directly into a CRM platform like Salesforce or HubSpot. Each form submission can trigger a Pipedream workflow that creates or updates a lead in the CRM, ensuring timely follow-up and improved lead management.
