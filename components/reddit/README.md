# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Social Listening**: Create a workflow that triggers whenever your brand is mentioned in specific subreddits. Use this to gather real-time feedback, monitor sentiment, and stay ahead of PR issues. Connect with a sentiment analysis tool like Google NLP on Pipedream to evaluate the tone of mentions.

- **Content Curation and Notification**: Set up a system that watches for new trending posts in your industry's subreddits, then compile and email a daily digest using Pipedream's built-in email action. This can keep a content marketing team informed and ready to engage with the latest trends.

- **Subreddit Management Automation**: For moderators and community managers, automate common subreddit tasks such as removing posts that don't meet certain criteria, banning users who repeatedly violate rules, or tagging and categorizing posts. This can be linked with a database like Airtable on Pipedream to log actions and keep an organized record.
