# Overview

The Wiza API offers robust tools for scraping LinkedIn profiles and turning them into structured data such as emails, names, and company details. This data can be pivotal for sales and marketing professionals to build lead lists, validate contact information, and enrich existing databases directly through API integration. Leveraging this API on Pipedream allows users to automate the entire process of lead generation and management by connecting Wiza to a myriad of other services like CRMs, email marketing platforms, and data analysis tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Generation Automation**: Automatically extract LinkedIn data using Wiza, then use this data to create or update leads in Salesforce. This workflow can trigger whenever a new profile matches predefined LinkedIn search criteria, ensuring up-to-date lead information is always available for sales teams.

- **Email Marketing Integration**: Use Wiza to gather detailed contact information, and then feed this data into Mailchimp to automate the creation of targeted email campaigns. This can also include automated segmentation based on the professional details collected, such as industry or job role, to tailor marketing efforts.

- **CRM Enrichment**: Enhance the utility of a CRM like HubSpot by automatically enriching contacts with additional data fetched via Wiza. This workflow can periodically update contact information in the CRM, ensuring that sales and marketing teams always have the most relevant and detailed information at their fingertips.
