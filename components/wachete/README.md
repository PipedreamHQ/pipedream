# Overview

The Wachete API lets you track changes in web content and get notified when updates happen. This is handy for monitoring websites for new content, price changes, or availability of products, without manually checking the sites. Using Pipedream, you can integrate Wachete with other apps to automate reactions to these updates. Think about monitoring your competitors’ sites, keeping tabs on industry news, or even watching for job postings. With Wachete on Pipedream, these tasks become set-and-forget operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Change Notification to Slack**: Monitor your favorite news outlet for the latest articles. When Wachete detects a new post, use Pipedream to send a formatted message with the update's details straight to a Slack channel. This keeps your team in the know, instantly.

- **E-commerce Price Tracking to Google Sheets**: Keep an eye on product prices across different e-commerce platforms. Set Wachete to watch for price changes, and with Pipedream’s help, log those changes in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. You can analyze trends, adjust your pricing strategies, or find the best time to buy.

- **Job Listing Alerts via Email**: Use Wachete to monitor career pages for new job listings. When a new opportunity pops up, Pipedream can trigger an email to you, or post to a job board you manage. This makes sure you or your audience don't miss out on new career opportunities.
