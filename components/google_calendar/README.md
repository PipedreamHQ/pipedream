# Overview

The Google Calendar API gives developers access to Google Calendar data,
allowing them to create their own applications that can read, write, and update
calendar data. With the API, users can integrate their own calendar
applications with Google Calendar, giving them the ability to manage their
calendars in one place. The API also provides the ability to search for events
and create new events.

Possible applications that could be built using the Google Calendar API
include:

- A calendar application that integrates with Google Calendar, allowing users
  to manage their calendars in one place.
- A calendar application that allows users to search for events and create new
  events.
- A to-do list application that integrates with Google Calendar, allowing users
  to see their tasks and events in one place.
- A reminder application that uses Google Calendar data to remind users of
  upcoming events.

Pipedream's use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to any other app will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the Limited Use requirements.
