# Overview

The Hippo Video API lets you harness the power of video in your business processes. Through Pipedream, you can automate video creation, management, and distribution workflows. This means you can trigger actions in Hippo Video based on events from other apps, or use Hippo Video events to kick off processes elsewhere. Whether it's automating video emails in your CRM, monitoring video analytics, or managing video content at scale, Pipedream's serverless platform empowers you to build and run workflows seamlessly.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Video Responses**: Automate sending personalized video responses to support ticket submissions via Zendesk. When a ticket is created, trigger a workflow to create a video in Hippo Video, then reply back to the ticket with the video link for a more engaging customer support experience.

- **Video Testimonials Pipeline**: Streamline collecting and publishing customer testimonials. Set up a workflow that triggers when a form is submitted, use Hippo Video to record and manage the testimonial, and then post the approved videos onto your company website or social media platforms through CMS or social media APIs.

- **Marketing Automation with Video Analytics**: Enhance your marketing campaigns by triggering actions based on video view analytics. Create a Pipedream workflow that listens for video view events from Hippo Video, analyze the viewing patterns, and integrate with email marketing platforms such as Mailchimp to follow up with viewers based on their engagement level.
