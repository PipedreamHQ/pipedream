# Overview

The Surveybot API is a tool designed to enhance engagement and gather insights through conversational surveys within Facebook Messenger. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can automate responses, analyze survey data, and integrate with an array of other services such as CRMs, email marketing platforms, or helpdesk software to streamline workflows and act upon the gathered data effectively.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Feedback Collection to Data Analysis Tools**: With Pipedream, set up a workflow where Surveybot collects customer satisfaction data post-purchase, and automatically send the results to data analysis tools such as Google Sheets or BigQuery. Slice and dice the data to gain actionable insights or trigger follow-up actions based on customer sentiment.

- **Support Ticket Creation from Survey Responses**: Whenever a survey response indicates a customer issue, use Pipedream to create a ticket in a customer support app like Zendesk or Intercom. This quick conversion from feedback to support ticket can help resolve issues swiftly and improve overall customer experience.

- **Lead Qualification and Addition to CRM**: Use Surveybot to qualify leads through a set of questions. With Pipedream, assess the responses and automatically add qualified leads to a CRM such as Salesforce or HubSpot, including all relevant data points. This can significantly cut down manual entry and ensure timely follow-up with potential customers.
