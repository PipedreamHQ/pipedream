# Overview

The Zagomail API enables you to automate email marketing tasks, manage contacts, and streamline campaigns directly from Pipedream. With this API, you can trigger actions based on events, update subscriber lists, send targeted emails, and track campaign performance. Pipedream's serverless platform lets you connect Zagomail with 3,000+ other apps to create bespoke workflows, without the need to manage infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Welcome Email Sequence**: Trigger a welcome email sequence in Zagomail when a new user signs up on your platform, using Pipedream's ability to listen for new database entries or form submissions. Ensure a timely and personalized onboarding experience with minimal manual effort.

- **Dynamic Campaign Management**: Use Pipedream to watch for changes in your CRM, like updated lead statuses, and automatically update subscriber segments in Zagomail. Kick off targeted email campaigns based on these segments to engage customers with relevant content.

- **E-commerce Abandoned Cart Reminders**: Connect Pipedream with an e-commerce platform, such as Shopify. When a cart is abandoned, trigger a workflow that sends a reminder email through Zagomail, encouraging the customer to complete their purchase. This can significantly improve conversion rates by bringing potential customers back to your store.
