# Overview

Megaventory is a robust inventory management API allowing for detailed tracking of products, orders, and the supply chain. You can automate the updating of stock levels, manage sales and purchase orders, and generate detailed reports. With Megaventory and Pipedream, you can craft automation workflows to streamline inventory operations, synchronize data across platforms, and trigger actions based on inventory changes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Inventory Level Alerts**: When stock levels for certain products fall below a designated threshold, trigger an alert using Pipedream to send notifications to Slack, ensuring timely restocking and avoiding stockouts.

- **Order Processing Automation**: Automate the processing of new sales orders from Megaventory: when an order is received, use Pipedream to create invoices in QuickBooks, send a confirmation email to the customer via SendGrid, and update CRM records in Salesforce.

- **Supplier Order Management**: When stock levels are low, automatically generate and send purchase orders to suppliers using Pipedream workflows. Integrate with email services to send the orders and update a Google Sheet with order details for easy tracking.
