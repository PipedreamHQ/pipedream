# Overview

Zoho Sign API lets you automate document signing processes. Integrate with Pipedream to create or manage documents, send them for signatures, and track status updates in real-time. Sync data with other apps, trigger workflows based on document actions, or automate follow-ups once signatures are received.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Document Workflow**: Upon a new sale in your CRM, automatically generate a sales contract using Zoho Sign, send it to the customer for signing, and receive notifications when the document is signed.

- **Document Status Tracking**: Set up a workflow to monitor document status on Zoho Sign. When a document gets signed or declined, update the status in a Google Sheet and notify relevant team members via Slack.

- **Contract Renewal Reminders**: Use Zoho Sign to detect contracts nearing expiry. Trigger emails to customers with renewal links and pre-filled documents for hassle-free re-signing.
