# Overview

E-goi's API lets you automate multichannel marketing campaigns, manage contacts, send out transactional emails, and much more. Pipedream, as a serverless integration and compute platform, amplifies these capabilities by allowing you to create workflows that trigger actions in E-goi based on events from a myriad of other services or custom logic.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New E-commerce Customers to E-goi**: Automatically add new customers from Shopify to a specific list in E-goi. When a customer is created in Shopify, the workflow triggers, adding the customer's details to E-goi for future email marketing campaigns.

- **Update CRM Leads with Email Engagement Data**: Sync engagement data from E-goi to Salesforce leads. If someone opens an email or clicks a link, the corresponding lead in Salesforce is updated with this interaction, keeping sales teams informed about prospect engagement.

- **Automate Support Ticket Creation from Email Replies**: When a customer replies to a marketing email, automatically create a support ticket in Zendesk. This ensures that customer inquiries are swiftly addressed without manual email monitoring.
