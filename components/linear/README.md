# Overview

Linear (OAuth) API provides access to Linear's issue tracking and project management capabilities, letting you automate tasks, synchronize data across platforms, and enhance your team's productivity. Whether you're reporting bugs, assigning tasks, or tracking progress, the Linear API on Pipedream allows for real-time, event-driven workflows that can increase efficiency and foster collaboration within teams.

# Example Use Cases

- **Issue Sync with GitHub**: Whenever a new issue is created in Linear, automatically create a corresponding GitHub issue. This keeps your project management and code repositories aligned, ensuring no task goes unnoticed by developers who primarily interact with GitHub.

- **Slack Notifications for Priority Tasks**: Set up a workflow where high-priority issues in Linear trigger instant messages to a designated Slack channel or user. This ensures critical items are immediately visible and can be acted upon swiftly by your team.

- **Customer Support Ticketing Integration**: Connect Linear with a customer support platform like Zendesk. When a support ticket escalates to a point where development work is needed, automatically create a new Linear issue to track the work, making sure customer problems are addressed in your development workflow.
