# Overview

The Cisco Meraki API on Pipedream allows developers to interact with Meraki's cloud-managed network infrastructure. Through the API, you can automate tasks, gather network insights, and control various aspects of your Meraki environment like network settings, clients, devices, and more. This seamless integration can elevate your network management to be more efficient and responsive to real-time data and events.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Network Alerts to Slack**: Use the Cisco Meraki API to monitor network traffic or device statuses and automatically send alerts to a Slack channel when anomalies or specific events are detected. This keeps your IT team promptly informed about network issues.

- **Sync Meraki Data with Google Sheets**: Collect data from your Meraki network devices and clients periodically and sync it to a Google Sheet for easy reporting and analysis. This can be useful for inventory management, usage tracking, or monitoring network performance trends over time.

- **Device Provisioning Workflow**: Create a workflow that triggers on a webhook from your internal system (like a ticketing system). When a new employee is onboarded, the workflow can provision a new device in the Meraki network, associate it with the user, and set up the appropriate policies, all done automatically.
