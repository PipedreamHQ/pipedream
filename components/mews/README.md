# Example Use Cases

Trigger this action in Pipedream when a new guest is added to the Mews system, ensuring timely and personalized guest engagement.

- **Dynamic Pricing Adjustment**: Integrate Mews with external pricing analysis tools to automatically update room rates based on demand. Use Pipedream to monitor occupancy data from Mews and trigger price changes that are then reflected back in the Mews system, optimizing revenue management strategies.
