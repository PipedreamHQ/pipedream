# Overview

The WhatsAble API enables automated interactions with WhatsApp, allowing you to send messages, create groups, and manage contacts programmatically. Integrating WhatsAble with Pipedream, you can craft serverless workflows that react to various triggers and perform actions on WhatsApp, like sending notifications or processing incoming messages. Pipedream's capability to connect with 3,000+ apps opens up a multitude of automation possibilities, streamlining communication tasks and linking WhatsApp with your digital ecosystem.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support Messages**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a new ticket is created in your helpdesk software (like Zendesk). The workflow can send an automated WhatsApp message to the customer, acknowledging the ticket and providing an estimated response time.

- **E-Commerce Order Updates**: Set up a workflow that listens for new orders from an e-commerce platform like Shopify. Once an order is placed, automatically send an order confirmation and updates on shipping status directly to the customer's WhatsApp.

- **Survey Responses Collector**: After a user completes a survey on Typeform, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends a thank-you message via WhatsApp and stores the survey response in a Google Sheet for data analysis and record-keeping.
