# Overview

The 3Scribe API provides a suite of transcription and natural language processing services, enabling the conversion of audio and video into text. It also offers tools for analyzing and understanding content within these transcriptions, such as sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and keyword extraction. When integrated with Pipedream, 3Scribe becomes a powerful component within a larger automated workflow, providing the ability to trigger actions based on transcribed content, analyze customer interactions, or archive searchable transcripts for compliance and training purposes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Meeting Minutes**: After every Zoom meeting, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends the recording to 3Scribe for transcription. Once the transcript is ready, use Pipedream's Google Docs integration to format and save the minutes in a shared company folder, and notify attendees via email using the SendGrid app.

- **Customer Call Analysis**: Connect 3Scribe to a CRM platform like Salesforce using Pipedream. Every customer support call recorded on your telephony platform can be transcribed by 3Scribe, with subsequent sentiment analysis to detect customer satisfaction. Results can be logged as part of the customer's record in Salesforce, triggering follow-up tasks or satisfaction surveys based on the sentiment.

- **Content Creation and SEO**: Use 3Scribe on Pipedream to transcribe podcasts or webinars, extract keywords, and generate drafts of blog posts or content summaries. Integrate with WordPress to post the content directly to your site, optimizing for search engines by using the extracted keywords to improve the SEO of your published materials.
