# Overview

The Adobe PDF Services API provides a robust set of tools for manipulating and managing PDF files. With this API, you can create, convert, combine, export, and manipulate PDFs directly in Pipedream. The Pipedream platform enables you to build automated workflows that can interact with this API to streamline document-centric processes, such as generating reports, archiving files, or extracting data from PDFs into other formats.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing**: Collect invoices as PDFs from an email or a web form, use Adobe PDF Services to extract text and data, and then store the extracted data in a database like Google Sheets or Airtable for easy tracking and analysis.

- **Document Conversion Pipeline**: Monitor a Dropbox or Google Drive folder for new documents, convert them into PDFs using Adobe PDF Services, and then upload the PDFs to a designated cloud storage location or send them via email to relevant stakeholders.

- **PDF Generation for Analytics Reports**: After a scheduled time, gather analytics data from sources like Google Analytics, compile the data into a templated PDF report using Adobe PDF Services, and distribute the report to a Slack channel or via email to your team.
