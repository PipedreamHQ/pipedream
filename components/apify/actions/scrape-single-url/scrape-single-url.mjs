It recognizes common blocking patterns like CAPTCHAs and automatically retries blocked requests through new sessions. However, running web browsers is more expensive as it requires more computing resources and is slower. It is recommended to use at least 8 GB of RAM.\n- **Stealthy web browser** (default) - Another headless web browser with anti-blocking measures enabled. Try this if you encounter bot protection while scraping. For best performance, use with Apify Proxy residential IPs. \n- **Raw HTTP client** - High-performance crawling mode that uses raw HTTP requests to fetch the pages. It is faster and cheaper, but it might not work on all websites.",
