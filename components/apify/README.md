# Overview

The Apify API unleashes the power to automate web scraping, process data, and orchestrate web automation workflows. By utilizing Apify on Pipedream, you can create dynamic serverless workflows to manage tasks like extracting data from websites, running browser automation, and scheduling these jobs to run autonomously. It integrates smoothly with Pipedream's capabilities to trigger actions on various other apps, store the results, and manage complex data flow with minimal setup.

# Example Use Cases

**E-commerce Price Monitoring**

- Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers an Apify actor to scrape product prices from multiple e-commerce sites daily. Store this data in Pipedream's built-in data store and use the Pipedream Email API to send a daily digest of the best deals to subscribers.

**Social Media Sentiment Analysis**

- Use Apify to scrape the latest tweets or social media posts about a specific topic or brand. Analyze the sentiment of these posts using a natural language processing service like Google Cloud Natural Language API. Then, use Pipedream to post the sentiment analysis results to a Slack channel for real-time brand monitoring.

**Real Estate Listings Aggregator**

- Create a workflow where Apify actors periodically fetch the latest real estate listings from multiple websites. Process and normalize the data with Pipedream's code steps, then automatically update a Google Sheet that serves as a central repository for all listings, keeping potential buyers informed with the latest options.
