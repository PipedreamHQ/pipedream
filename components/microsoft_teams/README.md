# Overview
      
With the Microsoft Teams API, you can build a variety of applications and integrations that work with Teams. For example, you could build a bot that responds to questions from users, or an app that lets users add information to a shared Teams document. You could also build an integration that lets users interact with an external service right from within Teams.
