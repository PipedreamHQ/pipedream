# Overview

With the Microsoft Teams API, you can build a variety of applications and
integrations that work with Teams. For example, you could build a bot that
responds to questions from users, or an app that lets users add information to
a shared Teams document. You could also build an integration that lets users
interact with an external service right from within Teams.
