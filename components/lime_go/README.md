# Overview

LIME Go is a smart CRM tailored for B2B sales teams, designed to streamline customer relationship management with features like lead generation, deal tracking, and proactive suggestions for best next steps. Using the LIME Go API with Pipedream allows you to automate interactions with your CRM data, sync with other business tools, and tailor your sales process with real-time data flows. Create workflows that trigger actions based on CRM events, enrich contact data, or synchronize sales activities across platforms, all with minimal code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Score Update Notification**: When a lead's score changes in LIME Go, Pipedream can catch this event and trigger an email or Slack message to the responsible salesperson. This instant notification helps your team act quickly on hot leads.

- **Cross-Platform Contact Sync**: Whenever a new contact is added to LIME Go, use Pipedream to automatically add that contact to other apps like Mailchimp, ensuring your marketing campaigns are always targeting the latest prospects.

- **Deal Progression Tracking**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to monitor deal stages in LIME Go. When a deal moves to a new stage, the workflow can update a Google Sheets spreadsheet, create tasks in project management tools like Trello or Asana, or send a celebratory message to your company's general chat in Microsoft Teams.
