# Overview

The Control D API allows you to manage and monitor internet access across different devices and networks. With it, you can automate the control of browsing data, enforce internet access policies, and generate detailed reports on internet usage. When integrated with Pipedream, these capabilities can be extended to automate workflows involving data from other apps, trigger actions based on internet usage patterns, and much more, leveraging Pipedream's capability to connect with hundreds of other apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Content Filtering Based on Time of Day**  
  Use the Control D API on Pipedream to dynamically change filtering rules based on the time of day. For instance, more restrictive rules could be applied during work hours and relaxed during off-hours, automatically. Connect with Google Calendar API to adjust internet access policies based on company-wide events or meetings.

- **Alerts for Unusual Activity**  
  Set up a workflow where the Control D API monitors internet traffic and uses Pipedream's integrated email service to send alerts when there is unusual activity, such as access to risky domains. This can be crucial for IT security in monitoring potential cyber threats in realtime.

- **Sync Internet Usage Stats with Analytics Tools**  
  Integrate Control D with analytics tools like Google Sheets or Microsoft Power BI through Pipedream. Automatically push detailed logs and usage statistics from Control D to these platforms for advanced analysis and visualization, enabling data-driven decisions regarding network management and policy adjustments.
