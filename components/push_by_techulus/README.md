# Overview

The Push by Techulus API offers a straightforward way to send notifications directly to your devices. With this functionality within Pipedream, you can craft workflows that alert you or someone else when certain events happen in your apps or in your code. Think of it as wiring a custom doorbell for the digital events that matter to you. Whether you're tracking sales on your e-commerce platform, monitoring website uptime, or just want to get pinged when your long-running script finishes, Push by Techulus nudges you in real time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sales Alert**: Set up a pipeline that monitors your e-commerce platform for new sales. Each time a sale goes through, trigger a Push notification to your phone with the sale details. You can use Pipedream's built-in support for Shopify or WooCommerce to easily detect new orders.

- **Website Uptime Monitor**: Combine Push by Techulus with a Pipedream scheduled workflow that pings your website at regular intervals. If your site goes down or the response time exceeds a threshold, send an instant Push notification, allowing for rapid response to outages.

- **CI/CD Completion Notification**: After a build or deployment process completes in your CI/CD pipeline, use the Push by Techulus API to notify your development team. This can be integrated with GitHub actions running on Pipedream to notify when a build passes or fails, keeping everyone in the loop.
