# Overview

The Builder.io API offers a powerful way to manage and deliver content across any platform with structured data. Using Pipedream, you can automate content creation, update workflows, and sync content across various applications. Pipedream's serverless platform allows you to connect Builder.io to hundreds of other services without writing complex code, triggering actions on events or on a schedule.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Content Publishing**: When a piece of content reaches a 'ready' state in Builder.io, a Pipedream workflow can automatically publish it to your website. This ensures that content goes live as soon as it's approved without manual intervention.

- **Sync Builder.io and CMS**: Integrate Builder.io with a content management system (CMS) like WordPress. When a new entry is added in Builder.io, the workflow can create a corresponding post in WordPress, keeping both platforms updated seamlessly.

- **Cross-Platform Content Distribution**: Use a Pipedream workflow to distribute content from Builder.io to multiple platforms such as social media (Twitter, LinkedIn) or email marketing services (Mailchimp, SendGrid) whenever new content is published, thus expanding the reach of your content without extra manual work.
