# Overview

The Octoparse API allows you to automate the extraction of web data without coding, making it a powerful tool for data-driven workflows. With this API, you can control your scraping tasks, retrieve extracted data, and manage your account programmatically. When combined with Pipedream's serverless execution environment, you can build custom workflows to process, store, or act upon the data fetched by Octoparse. This integration can be a cornerstone for solutions in market research, competitor analysis, price monitoring, or lead generation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Collection to Google Sheets**: Trigger a scraping task in Octoparse and, upon completion, send the extracted data to Google Sheets. This workflow is ideal for users needing regular updates for market research or competitive analysis without manual intervention.

- **Lead Generation with CRM Integration**: Use Octoparse to scrape contact information from target websites and automatically add these leads to a CRM platform like Salesforce. This workflow streamlines the process of expanding your sales funnel with fresh prospects.

- **Price Monitoring and Alerts**: Set Octoparse to track product prices on e-commerce websites and, using Pipedream, create a workflow that sends alerts via email or Slack if prices drop below a specified threshold. This can be an asset for businesses monitoring pricing strategies or for consumers looking for deals.
