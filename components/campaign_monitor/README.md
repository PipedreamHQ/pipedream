# Overview

The Campaign Monitor API allows developers to integrate powerful email marketing capabilities directly into their applications or workflows. Using Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate email campaigns, manage subscribers, and analyze the performance of your emails. Pipedream’s serverless platform simplifies connecting Campaign Monitor with other apps, enabling seamless data flow and sophisticated automation scenarios without extensive coding.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Subscriber Onboarding**: - When a new user signs up via your app, automatically add their email to a specific Campaign Monitor list and trigger a welcome email series. This can help in nurturing new leads and providing them with valuable content right from the start.

- **Event-Triggered Email Campaigns**: - Set up a workflow on Pipedream where emails through Campaign Monitor are triggered by specific actions users take within your app. For example, send a discount coupon via email when a user adds an item to their cart but doesn’t complete the purchase within 24 hours.

- **Feedback Collection Automation**: - After completing a transaction or a milestone within your service, automate sending a feedback request email using Campaign Monitor. Collect responses directly into a Google Sheets spreadsheet for easy review and analysis, enabling you to gather customer insights efficiently and improve your service.
