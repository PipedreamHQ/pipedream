# Overview

The Campaign Monitor API integrates seamlessly with Pipedream, offering powerful tools for email marketing automation. Using this API, you can manage lists, subscribers, and campaigns directly from Pipedream, creating dynamic, serverless workflows that enhance your email marketing efforts.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Subscriber Segmentation Workflow**: This workflow automatically updates subscriber lists based on user activity or demographic data. For instance, when a subscriber clicks a link in an email, Pipedream can trigger a process that adds this subscriber to a special interest group within Campaign Monitor, enabling more targeted follow-up campaigns.

- **Feedback Collection and Analysis**: After sending a campaign, automatically send a follow-up survey using Google Forms. Collect and analyze feedback by syncing responses back to Campaign Monitor to segment users or tailor future content based on their preferences. This workflow ensures continuous improvement of your email content based on direct subscriber feedback.

- **Real-time Campaign Performance Dashboard**: Combine Campaign Monitor with a data visualization tool like Google Sheets or a custom dashboard app. Use Pipedream to pass real-time campaign performance data (open rates, click-through rates, etc.) to these platforms. This workflow provides instantaneous insights into campaign effectiveness, allowing for quick adjustments and optimizations.
