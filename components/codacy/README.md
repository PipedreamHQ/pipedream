# Overview

The Codacy API lends itself to automated code review and analysis within Pipedream's serverless platform. By wielding this API, you can craft workflows that trigger on code pushes, scrutinize code quality, enforce coding standards, and seamlessly integrate with other tools for broader development process automation. It's a gateway to embed code quality checks into your CI/CD pipeline, get real-time alerts, and keep your codebase healthy, all within the Pipedream ecosystem.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Code Quality Report on Push**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream whenever a new commit is pushed to your repository, using it to call the Codacy API to perform an automated code review. Once the analysis is complete, collect and send a report detailing code quality metrics to your team's Slack channel.

- **Enforce Coding Standards Before Merging Pull Requests**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that runs every time a new pull request is opened. The workflow communicates with the Codacy API to check if the changes adhere to your predefined coding standards. If the pull request fails the check, automatically add a comment on the pull request with the issues that need to be resolved.

- **Daily Code Quality Snapshot to Email**: Schedule a daily workflow in Pipedream that uses the Codacy API to fetch the latest code quality data for your main branches. Compile this data into a snapshot and dispatch a digest email to your development team, highlighting any new issues or improvements in the code quality over the past day.
