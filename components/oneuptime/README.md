# Overview

OneUptime's API provides the tools to monitor applications and servers, track incidents, and manage uptime from a developer's point of view. With Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create automated workflows that respond to uptime events, synchronize incident reports with other tools, and aggregate performance data for analysis. It's about connecting OneUptime's monitoring prowess with your existing infrastructure to automate responses, notifications, and reporting.

# Example Use Cases

- **Incident Response Notifications**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream when OneUptime detects an incident. Automatically notify team members via Slack, send an SMS via Twilio, or create an incident ticket in Jira. This ensures quick attention and resolution to issues affecting your services.

- **Performance Metrics Dashboard Update**: Collect and send performance metrics from OneUptime to a Google Sheet or a data visualization tool like Grafana whenever a monitoring check is completed. Use this data to maintain an up-to-date dashboard for real-time performance analysis, helping you make informed decisions.

- **Automated Status Page Updates**: When OneUptime identifies an incident, use a Pipedream workflow to update the company status page hosted on a platform like Statuspage.io. Include the incident details and expected resolution times to keep users informed without manual intervention.
