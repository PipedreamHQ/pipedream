# Overview

The Veriphone API is your go-to tool within Pipedream for validating and standardizing phone numbers across the globe. It checks phone numbers for correctness, formats them into a standardized E.164 format, and provides carrier and country details. By integrating Veriphone API into your Pipedream workflows, you can automate processes like user verification, data cleaning for marketing campaigns, and enhance the quality of your contact databases.

# Example Use Cases

- **User Signup Verification**: When a user signs up for your service, automate a workflow that uses the Veriphone API to validate the phone number they provide. Connect it to your user database (like MySQL or MongoDB) on Pipedream to store the standardized number and user details upon successful verification.

- **CRM Data Cleaning**: Set up a periodic workflow that sifts through your CRM platform, such as HubSpot or Salesforce, to validate and update the phone numbers in your contact list. This ensures that your sales or customer service teams always have accurate and usable contact information.

- **SMS Marketing Optimization**: Before sending out a bulk SMS campaign, use a workflow that integrates the Veriphone API to validate the recipients' phone numbers. Connect this to your messaging service, like Twilio, to send messages only to verified numbers, helping you cut costs and improve the delivery success rate.
