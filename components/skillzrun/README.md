# Overview

The SkillzRun API enables developers and businesses to enhance their educational platforms by leveraging SkillzRun's capabilities. This API can be used to automate the distribution of learning materials, track user progress, and manage assignments. With Pipedream's serverless integration platform, you can create workflows that respond to events in SkillzRun, connect with other apps, or send data to various endpoints, all with minimal code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate User Progress Tracking**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream whenever a user completes a module or course in SkillzRun. The workflow could then log this information in a Google Sheet or database, send a congratulatory email via SendGrid, and update a Slack channel with the user's achievement.

- **Distribute Personalized Learning Materials**: Create a Pipedream workflow that listens for new users or user milestones in SkillzRun. On triggering, use the workflow to call external APIs like Dropbox or Google Drive to distribute personalized learning materials based on the user's progress or course selection.

- **Streamline Assignment Grading and Feedback**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers when assignments are submitted in SkillzRun. The workflow could automatically grade the assignment if it's a quiz, provide feedback by integrating with natural language processing services like OpenAI, and then record the results in an LMS or notify the instructor via email.
