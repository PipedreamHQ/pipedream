# Overview

SkillzRun API provides robust features for managing online courses, student interactions, and educational content delivery. This API enables developers to automate educational workflows, integrate e-learning systems, and enhance student engagement through customized interactions. By integrating SkillzRun with Pipedream, users can automate processes like enrollment notifications, course updates, and dynamic content delivery, reducing manual effort and increasing operational efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Student Enrollment Notifications**: Create a workflow where SkillzRun triggers an event every time a new student enrolls in a course. Use Pipedream to catch this trigger and automate an email or SMS notification via SendGrid or Twilio, welcoming the student and providing them with necessary course materials and access details.

- **Course Progress Tracker**: Set up a workflow where SkillzRun sends data to Pipedream about student progress in a course. Connect this with Google Sheets or Airtable to log this data. This allows educators to monitor student progress in real-time and intervene when necessary to provide additional support or resources.

- **Feedback Collection Automation**: Implement a workflow that triggers at the end of each course module via SkillzRun, asking for student feedback. Use Pipedream to integrate this trigger with a survey tool like Typeform or Google Forms, automatically sending out feedback forms. Gathered data can be pushed to a CRM like HubSpot or Salesforce for analysis and to enhance course content based on feedback.
