# Overview

The Polygon.io API provides access to an extensive array of financial data including stocks, forex, and cryptocurrency information. In Pipedream, you can harness this data to create robust, serverless workflows that react to market changes, automate reporting, or integrate with other financial tools. Workflows can range from simple data retrieval to complex trading strategies.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-time Stock Alerting**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that uses the Polygon.io API to monitor stock prices and volumes. When a stock hits certain thresholds, send alerts via email or SMS using integrations like SendGrid or Twilio.

- **Automated Reporting**: Build a workflow that aggregates daily financial data from Polygon.io and compiles it into a comprehensive report. Use Pipedream's built-in cron scheduler to run this workflow daily, and send the report to Google Sheets or via email.

- **Trading Strategy Execution**: Create a workflow that uses Polygon.io to fetch real-time market data, evaluates it against your trading criteria using Pipedream's code steps, and places trades via a broker's API like Alpaca. Log all trades and results to a data store for performance analysis.
