# Overview

The Nango API is a bridge for integrating with SaaS apps, smoothing out authentication and API call complexities. On Pipedream, you can harness Nango to automate interactions between various services without getting bogged down by the nuances of OAuth flows or API intricacies. Use Nango to authenticate once, and let Pipedream workflows handle the rest, executing tasks, syncing data, and triggering actions across apps efficiently.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Social Media Postings**: Automate the scheduling of social media posts across platforms. When a new blog post goes live, use Nango to authenticate and post updates to Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook via their respective APIs.

- **Sync CRM and Support Tickets**: Keep your CRM up-to-date by syncing new support tickets from a customer service platform like Zendesk. As new tickets arrive, Nango can handle the authentication to add or update the corresponding customer records in a CRM like Salesforce.

- **Manage Email Marketing Campaigns**: Coordinate an email marketing campaign across multiple platforms. When a new subscriber is added to a platform like Mailchimp, use Nango to authenticate and replicate the subscriber data to other marketing tools such as SendGrid or ConvertKit for broader reach.
