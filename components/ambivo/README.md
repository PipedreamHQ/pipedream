# Overview

The Ambivo API provides access to a range of services for web scraping, image processing, and data extraction. On Pipedream, you can leverage these capabilities to automate workflows that require the transformation and analysis of content from various sources. Whether you're looking to extract text from images, scrape web data without getting blocked, or perform content-based image retrieval, Ambivo can be integrated with Pipedream's serverless platform to build robust and scalable automations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Change Detection and Notification**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that periodically checks a website using Ambivo's web scraping capabilities. If new content is detected, trigger an alert or notification through email, Slack, or another communication platform connected to Pipedream.

- **Image-Based Search Engine**: Create a workflow that allows users to upload an image, then use Ambivo's content-based image retrieval to find similar images from a dataset or across the web. The results can be stored in a Pipedream data store or sent to a database of your choice for further processing or indexing.

- **Automated Image Processing Pipeline**: Develop a pipeline in Pipedream that takes images uploaded to a cloud storage platform, processes them with Ambivo's image processing services to extract text or analyze content, and then routes the processed data to other services or apps for additional workflows like translation, sentiment analysis, or database entry.
