# Overview

The Superdocu API empowers users to automate document collection and management processes, streamlining the way businesses handle paperwork for clients and employees. It facilitates the creation of document requests, tracking of submissions, and management of user data, all programmatically. Leveraging the Superdocu API on Pipedream allows users to build powerful, serverless workflows that can interact with a broad array of other applications, improving efficiency, reducing manual labor, and ensuring critical documents are collected and processed on time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Document Collection for Client Onboarding**: Create a Pipedream workflow that triggers when a new client is added to your CRM, like Salesforce. Automatically send a Superdocu document request to the client, with personalized instructions and deadlines for submission. Once documents are submitted, update the client's record in Salesforce, moving them to the next stage in the onboarding process.

- **HR Employee Onboarding**: When a new employee record is created in your HR platform (for example, BambooHR), trigger a Superdocu document request for mandatory onboarding documents such as tax forms and identification. Once the documents are collected, use Pipedream to notify the HR team and store the files securely in a service like Google Drive or Dropbox.

- **Contract Management Automation**: Set up a workflow that listens for new contracts created in a project management tool like Asana or Trello. When a new contract card is added, use Superdocu to request necessary signatures from all parties. Upon receiving the signed documents, Pipedream can update the project status and archive the final contract in a designated cloud storage platform, and notify team members through communication channels such as Slack or email.
