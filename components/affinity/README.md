# Overview

The Affinity API allows for deep integration with Affinity's CRM platform, providing access to a relationship intelligence system that helps you manage relationships, prioritize opportunities, and automate administrative tasks. Utilize the API on Pipedream to create custom, automated workflows that respond to various triggers, such as new leads or interactions, and connect with other apps to enhance data flow and functionality.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Lead Assignment**: When a new contact is added in Affinity, use Pipedream to automatically assign the contact to a sales rep based on specific criteria like location or industry. Send a notification via Slack or email to the assigned rep with the contact details and any relevant notes or tasks.

- **Sync Events with Google Calendar**: Automatically create a Google Calendar event whenever an Affinity calendar event is created for a deal or a meeting. Pipedream can keep your scheduling in sync, ensuring no overlap and that all stakeholders have visibility into upcoming commitments.

- **Aggregate Relationship Intelligence**: Whenever a new interaction is logged in Affinity, Pipedream can funnel this data to a data analysis tool like Google Sheets or Tableau. This allows for comprehensive analysis of communication patterns, helping to refine engagement strategies and identify areas for improvement.
