# Overview

Ably API provides a platform for adding real-time messaging, streaming, and presence capabilities to your apps. With Pipedream, you can harness this power to create dynamic, event-driven workflows. Automate notifications, synchronize data across systems in real time, or react to Ably events to trigger actions in other services, like sending emails, updating databases, or calling external APIs.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time Alert System**: Trigger an email or SMS notification via SendGrid or Twilio when a message is published on an Ably channel. This is ideal for real-time user alerts, system status updates, or time-sensitive information dissemination.

- **Chatbot Integration**: Connect a Slack bot to an Ably channel to facilitate immediate response to customer queries. Whenever a new message appears in Ably, the Slack bot can process the message and respond accordingly, streamlining customer service operations.

- **Cross-Platform Event Synchronization**: Use Pipedream to listen for Ably events and propagate them to other services like Salesforce, Google Sheets, or a custom API. This is perfect for ensuring that when an event happens in one part of your system, the relevant stakeholders or systems are updated instantly across platforms.
