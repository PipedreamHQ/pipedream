# Overview

The Mboum API offers rich financial data, including real-time stock quotes, financial statements, and market analysis. On Pipedream, this translates into the ability to craft workflows that can automate tasks for investors, analysts, and fintech applications. For instance, you can trigger actions based on stock price changes, compile financial reports, or integrate with other services to enrich financial datasets.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Stock Alerts**: Set up a workflow that monitors specific stock prices through the Mboum API. When a price threshold is crossed, the workflow can trigger a notification to your email or messaging app, keeping you updated in real-time.

- **Financial Reports Generation**: Create a workflow that periodically fetches financial statements for a set of companies using the Mboum API. Then, it compiles this data into a formatted report and sends it to cloud storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox for easy access and sharing.

- **Market Sentiment Analysis**: Combine Mboum's market analysis with a natural language processing (NLP) app to gauge sentiment. The workflow can fetch the latest market news and use NLP to analyze sentiment, summarizing the mood of the market in an automated dashboard or report.
