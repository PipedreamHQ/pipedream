# Overview

Fileforge API enables users to manage and automate file-related tasks in the cloud. With Fileforge on Pipedream, you can create custom workflows integrating file operations seamlessly with other platforms. This includes creating, editing, converting, and sharing files across various formats and systems, enhancing productivity and streamlining operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated File Conversion and Backup to Google Drive**: Set up a workflow where Fileforge automatically converts uploaded files into a different format (e.g., DOCX to PDF) and subsequently backs them up to Google Drive. Useful for maintaining consistency in document formats in cloud storage and ensuring that backups are always up-to-date.

- **Scheduled Reports Generation and Emailing**: Leveraging Fileforge, you can automate the generation of reports at scheduled intervals (weekly, monthly), convert them into a preferred format (e.g., Excel to PDF) and email them directly to stakeholders. This can be particularly beneficial for finance and sales teams needing regular updates.

- **Dynamic File Handling and Slack Notifications**: Create a workflow where files uploaded to a specific Dropbox folder are automatically retrieved and processed using Fileforge for tasks such as resizing images or watermarking PDFs. Once processed, the files can be sent to a designated Slack channel notifying team members of the new files availability and status.
