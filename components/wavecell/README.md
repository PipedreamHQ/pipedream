# Overview

The 8x8 (Wavecell) API offers robust capabilities for voice and SMS messaging services, enabling you to engage customers through automated communications. Whether it's sending out timely notifications, verifying user identities with OTPs, or streamlining customer support processes, the API provides a versatile platform for enhancing your communication workflows. With Pipedream, you can harness this potential by crafting serverless integrations that trigger 8x8 actions based on events from countless other apps, or even custom logic.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support Tickets Alerting**: Integrate 8x8 with a customer support platform like Zendesk to automatically send SMS updates to customers when their support ticket status changes. This ensures they're kept in the loop, improving customer satisfaction and engagement.

- **E-Commerce Order Confirmation and Updates**: For each new order placed on an e-commerce platform like Shopify, trigger an 8x8 workflow to send a confirmation SMS to the customer, and follow up with delivery status updates. This proactive communication can enhance the customer experience and reduce inbound inquiry volumes.

- **Event-Driven Notification System for IT Monitoring**: Combine 8x8 with an IT monitoring tool like Datadog. Set up a workflow to send an SMS to your IT team when critical alerts or incidents are detected. Quick notifications mean faster response times, minimizing downtime and operational disruptions.
