# Overview

The Blizzard Battle.net API provides programmatic access to game-related data for Blizzard titles like World of Warcraft, Diablo III, StarCraft II, and others. Through Pipedream, developers can automate interactions with this API to retrieve game statistics, player data, and more. Such integration allows for the creation of custom dashboards, alert systems, or even integrating game data with other services for enhanced user experiences.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Player Stats Dashboard**: Trigger a scheduled workflow in Pipedream that fetches player statistics from games like World of Warcraft or Overwatch. Use this data to update a Google Sheets document or a custom dashboard hosted on a service like AWS S3, providing real-time stats tracking for guilds or individual players.

- **Twitch Stream Alerts for Achievements**: Combine Blizzard Battle.net API with Twitch API to send live notifications on Twitch when a streamer achieves something notable in a game like Diablo III. Use Pipedream to monitor the Battle.net API for specific events and then push these alerts as in-stream messages or notifications to viewers, enhancing viewer engagement.

- **Discord Bot for Guild Updates**: Create a Discord bot that uses Pipedream to connect with the Blizzard Battle.net API to pull the latest guild achievements or raid completions. This bot can automatically post these updates in a guildâ€™s Discord server, keeping members informed and engaged with the latest accomplishments.
