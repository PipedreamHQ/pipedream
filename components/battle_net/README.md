# Overview

The Blizzard Battle.net API provides programmatic access to game-related data from Blizzard Entertainment games like World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and Diablo III. Through Pipedream, developers can automate interactions with this API to retrieve game statistics, player data, and other game-specific information. This integration enables the creation of custom notifications, analytics, and other applications that enhance the gaming experience or support community-building and content creation around Blizzard games.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Player Stats Summary Emails**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to fetch player statistics from games like World of Warcraft or Overwatch at regular intervals. Combine this data with the SendGrid app on Pipedream to automatically send weekly or monthly player stats summaries to email subscribers.

- **Discord Notifications for Guild Activities**: Create a workflow that monitors specific events or achievements within a game like World of Warcraft using the Blizzard Battle.net API. Use the Discord Bot app on Pipedream to send real-time updates or alerts to a Discord server whenever these specified events occur, keeping a guild or community informed and engaged.

- **Streamlined Content Creation for Game Streamers**: Implement a workflow where game data from Blizzard Battle.net is retrieved and analyzed to generate content ideas or summaries for streamers. This could include notable achievements, leaderboard changes, or rare in-game events. Streamers can then use this curated information to create engaging content for their viewers, with potential integration into platforms like Twitch or YouTube to automatically update stream descriptions or post highlights.
