# Overview

CraftMyPDF is a powerful API that allows you to create dynamic and customizable PDF documents. By leveraging this API on Pipedream, you can automate the generation of invoices, reports, tickets, and any other document that requires a polished and professional look. Pipedream's serverless platform enables you to connect CraftMyPDF with numerous apps to create workflows that trigger PDF generation from events like form submissions, new database entries, or scheduled jobs.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Generation**: When a new order is placed through an e-commerce platform like Shopify, trigger a workflow on Pipedream that captures the order details and sends them to CraftMyPDF. The API generates a custom invoice PDF which is then automatically emailed to the customer and saved to a cloud storage service like Dropbox.

- **Monthly Reporting for Analytics**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that runs at the end of each month, pulling analytics data from a tool like Google Analytics. The data is formatted and sent to CraftMyPDF to create a comprehensive visual report. The final PDF can be distributed via email to stakeholders or uploaded to a shared workspace such as Google Drive.

- **Event Ticketing Upon Registration**: When a user registers for an event using a form on platforms like Typeform or Google Forms, trigger a Pipedream workflow that collects the registration data. CraftMyPDF creates a personalized event ticket in PDF format, which is then sent to the registrant's email and added to a database for event management purposes.
