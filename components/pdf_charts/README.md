# Overview

The PDF Charts API is a tool for creating custom, professional-looking charts and graphs in PDF format. Leveraging Pipedreamâ€™s serverless integration platform, you can automate the generation of these PDF documents based on various triggers and data sources. For instance, you can produce sales reports from CRM data, generate analytics from website traffic, or even create personalized financial statements, all in a visually engaging PDF format.
