# Overview

The PDF Charts API allows users to create high-quality, customizable PDF documents featuring various chart types directly from data. This API is especially valuable in automated reporting systems, data visualization for analytics, and dynamically generated financial or operational reports. By integrating this API with Pipedream, you can automate the generation and distribution of these documents based on triggers from numerous other apps and data sources, streamlining processes like monthly sales reporting, customer analytics, or resource management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Monthly Sales Reports**: Automatically generate a PDF sales report at the end of each month using data from Salesforce. The PDF Charts API can be used to create visualizations of sales trends, revenue by product, and other key metrics, which are then compiled into a PDF and emailed to stakeholders via SendGrid.

- **Real-Time Analytics Dashboard PDF Generation**: Trigger a PDF generation whenever a Google Sheets spreadsheet is updated with new data. Use the PDF Charts API to convert these updates into a series of charts, providing stakeholders with a visual, real-time analytics dashboard they can view offline.

- **Resource Management for Project Teams**: On a weekly basis, automatically pull data from a project management tool like Asana or Monday.com, use the PDF Charts API to create visual representations of resource allocation and project progress, and distribute the report via Slack to keep the entire team informed.
