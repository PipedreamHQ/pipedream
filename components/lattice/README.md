# Overview

The Lattice API enables you to tap into a powerful people management platform, ideal for handling performance reviews, goal setting, and employee engagement within your organization. When you combine Lattice with Pipedream, you unlock the potential for automating various HR processes, synchronizing employee data across systems, and generating real-time insights. Pipedream acts as a facilitator, providing you with a serverless platform where you can connect Lattice to a multitude of other apps and create custom workflows tailored to your company's needs.

# Example Use Cases

- **Synchronize New Employees to HRIS:** When a new employee is added in Lattice, this workflow can automatically update your Human Resources Information System (HRIS), ensuring that employee records are always synced across your internal systems.

- **Automate Performance Review Reminders:** Set up a workflow that listens for upcoming performance reviews in Lattice and sends out automated reminders to managers and employees via email or a messaging app like Slack, keeping everyone informed and on schedule.

- **Aggregate Feedback for Reporting:** Collect feedback and reviews submitted through Lattice, and use Pipedream to aggregate and push this data into a BI tool like Google Sheets or Tableau, allowing for in-depth analysis and easier reporting on employee performance.
