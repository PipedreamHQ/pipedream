# Overview

The Onfleet API integrates with Pipedream to power logistics and delivery operations, offering real-time tracking, optimized routes, automatic dispatch, analytics, and communication with drivers. With Pipedream's serverless platform, one can automate complex workflows involving Onfleet and other apps, triggering actions based on events, scheduling tasks, or processing data to enhance delivery services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Delivery Alerts**: When a delivery is marked as completed in Onfleet, trigger a workflow on Pipedream that sends a customizable confirmation email to the customer through SendGrid, thanking them for their business and encouraging feedback.

- **Dynamic Route Optimization**: As new orders come in through an e-commerce platform like Shopify, use Pipedream to automatically create delivery tasks in Onfleet, with the added capability to dynamically adjust routes as more orders are received to optimize for time and fuel efficiency.

- **Customer Support Ticket Creation**: If a delivery encounters an issue, such as being marked as failed or delayed in Onfleet, trigger a Pipedream workflow that creates a support ticket in a tool like Zendesk, ensuring the customer service team promptly addresses and resolves the delivery issues.
