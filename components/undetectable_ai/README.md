# Overview

Undetectable AI API offers tools to analyze and modify media content, helping to detect and prevent digital content manipulation. It's particularly useful in verifying the authenticity of images and videos, especially in contexts where content integrity is crucial, such as news media, content moderation, and legal evidence. Using Pipedream, you can automate workflows integrating Undetectable AI with other services, enhancing both the scalability and responsiveness of your content verification processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Verification System**: Triggered by content uploads to a cloud storage like AWS S3, this workflow uses the Undetectable AI API to assess the authenticity of uploaded images or videos. Results can be logged into a Google Sheets for record-keeping and further review.

- **Real-Time Social Media Monitoring**: Connect the Undetectable AI API to a Twitter stream to automatically analyze images and videos shared in tweets. Use this setup to flag potentially manipulated content, automatically alerting a moderation team via Slack or email.

- **Legal Document Integrity Checker**: In environments where document authenticity is paramount, set up a workflow where PDFs or image files received via email (e.g., using a service like Gmail) are automatically sent to Undetectable AI API for verification. The results could then be stored in a secure database and an alert sent if manipulation is detected.
