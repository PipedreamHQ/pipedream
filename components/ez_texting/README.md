# Overview

The iHomefinder API provides real estate data services, including property listings, market info, and lead management. With Pipedream, you can automate how you interact with this data. For instance, you can sync new listings to a CRM, update your website with the latest properties, or trigger marketing emails when a new lead is captured.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate CRM Updates with New Listings**: Listen for new property listings in the iHomefinder API and automatically update your CRM—like Salesforce or HubSpot—with fresh listings to keep sales teams informed and responsive.

- **Dynamic Website Content Updates**: Use the iHomefinder API to fetch new property data and automatically push updates to your website's listings page. This can be done through Pipedream's HTTP actions or by integrating with a CMS like WordPress.

- **Lead Management with Email Automation**: When a new lead registers through iHomefinder, trigger workflows in Pipedream to add the lead to an email marketing tool like Mailchimp, and send them a personalized welcome email along with curated property recommendations.
