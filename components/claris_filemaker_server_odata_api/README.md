# Overview

The Claris FileMaker Server OData API allows you to interact with your FileMaker databases through a standardized protocol that can be integrated with a variety of web services and applications. This API enables you to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data in your FileMaker solutions from external sources. By utilizing this API on Pipedream, you can automate workflows that push or pull data, synchronize records with external systems, and trigger actions based on data changes, enhancing the interoperability and extendibility of your FileMaker databases.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Entry from Web Forms**: - Capture data from online forms directly into FileMaker databases. Set up a workflow where a web form (e.g., Google Forms or Typeform) submission triggers a Pipedream workflow that pushes the data into a specific FileMaker database using the Claris FileMaker Server OData API. This eliminates manual data entry and ensures data consistency.

- **Sync FileMaker Data with CRM**: - Keep FileMaker data synchronized with a CRM platform like Salesforce. When records are updated in FileMaker, use Pipedream to detect these changes and mirror them in Salesforce, ensuring that sales and customer service teams always have the most current data available.

- **Inventory Management Notifications**: - Monitor inventory levels stored in a FileMaker database and send notifications when stock for particular items falls below a certain threshold. This Pipedream workflow can trigger emails or SMS messages to relevant personnel to reorder stock, using integrations with email platforms like SendGrid or messaging services like Twilio.
