# Overview

The Planning Center API offers a suite of church management features, allowing for the seamless coordination of events, services, and resources. With Pipedream, you can automate tasks, sync data across different platforms, and create dynamic workflows that save time and reduce errors. This can include managing attendees, coordinating service schedules, tracking donations, and more. Pipedream's serverless platform connects with the Planning Center API to create workflows that trigger on new data, process and transform data, and automate communication and organizational tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Attendee Follow-up**: Trigger a workflow when a new attendee checks in at a service via Planning Center. Use Pipedream to send a personalized email or SMS via SendGrid or Twilio, thanking them for attending and providing next steps or resources.

- **Resource Management and Scheduling**: Sync Planning Center resource bookings with Google Calendar. When a new resource booking is added in Planning Center, a workflow can automatically create a corresponding event in a designated Google Calendar, ensuring that all team members stay informed about resource availability and event times.

- **Donation Tracking & Accounting Integration**: When new donations are recorded in Planning Center, trigger a workflow that logs this information into an accounting app like QuickBooks or sends a thank you message to the donor. This not only saves manual data entry but also helps in maintaining accurate financial records and nurturing donor relationships.
