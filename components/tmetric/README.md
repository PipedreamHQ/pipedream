# Overview

The TMetric API provides the ability to interact programmatically with TMetric's time tracking features, allowing developers to create, read, update, and delete time entries, projects, and workspaces. By leveraging the API within Pipedream, you can connect TMetric to 3,000+ other apps to automate time tracking as part of larger business processes, such as invoicing, project management, and reporting workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Time Tracking Reports**: Generate weekly or monthly time tracking reports in TMetric and automatically send them to a specified email address using the SendGrid app within Pipedream. This workflow can help keep teams and clients updated on project progress without manual intervention.

- **Project Management Sync**: Synchronize TMetric projects and tasks with a project management tool like Trello or Asana. Whenever a new task is created in the project management app, a corresponding time entry can be automatically created in TMetric, ensuring seamless tracking of work across platforms.

- **Invoice Creation and Delivery**: Connect TMetric to an invoicing app like QuickBooks or Stripe. When a project reaches a certain amount of logged hours, trigger the creation of an invoice based on the time tracked and send it to the client. This creates a streamlined process from work completion to payment request.
