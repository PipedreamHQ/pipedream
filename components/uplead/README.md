# Overview

The UpLead API provides access to a robust database of B2B contacts and companies, enabling users to enrich leads with detailed information like email addresses, phone numbers, company details, and more. Within Pipedream, you can integrate the UpLead API to automate lead enrichment, sync lead data with other tools, and build custom workflows that leverage UpLead's data for sales intelligence, marketing campaigns, and CRM data enhancement.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Enrichment in Real-Time**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream whenever a new lead is captured via a web form. Use the UpLead API to enrich the lead's data and then automatically add the detailed lead information to a CRM like Salesforce or a marketing platform like Mailchimp for immediate follow-up or nurturing.

- **Scheduled Data Sync for CRM**: Set up a scheduled workflow in Pipedream that runs at regular intervals (daily, weekly) to fetch new and updated contacts from UpLead. The workflow can cross-reference existing CRM records, update them with fresh data, and add new leads to ensure your sales team always has the latest information at their fingertips.

- **Alerts for Target Account Changes**: Monitor specific companies or industries for changes in key data points, such as company size, funding rounds, or executive movements. Use the UpLead API in a Pipedream workflow to regularly check for these updates and send notifications via Slack or email to relevant stakeholders when important changes are detected.
