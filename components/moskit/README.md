# Overview

The Moskit API, integrated with Pipedream, offers a robust platform for automating CRM-related activities. With this API, you can orchestrate data synchronization, streamline customer engagement processes, and enhance sales workflows. By leveraging the Moskit API through Pipedream, you can create custom serverless workflows that react to various CRM events, manipulate data, and connect with countless other services for a seamless automation experience.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Qualification Automation**: Automatically qualify leads in Moskit by setting up a workflow on Pipedream that triggers when a new lead is added. The workflow could enrich lead data using Clearbit, score the lead based on predefined criteria, and then update the lead's status in Moskit accordingly. This process ensures that sales teams focus on high-potential prospects, improving conversion rates.

- **Customer Onboarding Sequence**: Create a customer onboarding sequence by triggering a Pipedream workflow when a deal is marked as won in Moskit. The workflow could send a welcome email via SendGrid, create a new customer record in QuickBooks for invoicing, and set up a series of tasks in Trello for onboarding the new customer. This automation provides a consistent onboarding experience and reduces manual tasks for sales and operations teams.

- **Real-time Sales Notifications**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to send real-time notifications to a Slack channel whenever a deal approaches its closing date or moves to a new stage in Moskit. This keeps the sales team informed and ensures timely follow-up with prospects, potentially increasing the chances of closing deals.
