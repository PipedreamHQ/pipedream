# Overview

With the LaunchDarkly API, you can easily create custom user experiences for
your application or website. You can use the API to segment your users based on
criteria such as location, device, or even custom attributes, and then change
the application experience for those segments in real-time.

Here are a few examples of what you can build with the LaunchDarkly API:

- A/B testing of new features
- Targeted content for specific user segments
- Dynamic Experiences based on user interactions
- Real-time analytics of user behavior
