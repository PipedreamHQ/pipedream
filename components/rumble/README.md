# Overview

Rumble is a video hosting platform that encourages content discovery and sharing. With the Rumble API on Pipedream, you can automate video uploads, manage user content, and analyze video performance metrics. For instance, you might automate video uploads in response to events, sync video statistics to a database for analysis, or integrate with social media platforms to widen your content's reach.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Video Uploads Workflow**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream that listens for new files in a Dropbox folder. When a new video is detected, the workflow automatically uploads the video to your Rumble account. This saves time and ensures consistent video publishing schedules.

- **Content Moderation and Notification**: Use a workflow that monitors new comments on your Rumble videos. When certain keywords or patterns are detected, suggesting inappropriate or spam content, the workflow could flag the comment and notify you via Slack or email. This helps maintain a clean and professional comment section on your videos.

- **Video Performance Dashboard Integration**: Set up a workflow triggered by a recurring schedule to fetch the latest viewing stats for your Rumble videos and insert them into a Google Sheets document. This creates a continually updated dashboard that provides insights into video performance, helping to inform your content strategy.
