# Overview

The CodeREADr API allows you to integrate barcode scanning and data collection into your workflows on Pipedream. With this API, you can automate barcode validation, track event attendance, manage inventory, and more by creating, updating, and retrieving scan records. Pipedream's serverless platform enables you to connect CodeREADr with other apps, triggering actions based on scan data, or enriching CodeREADr data with information from other sources.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Check-in System**: Use the CodeREADr API on Pipedream to scan tickets or badges for events, automatically checking in attendees by validating barcodes against a database. Upon successful validation, trigger an email or SMS confirmation using SendGrid or Twilio.

- **Inventory Management**: Sync barcode scans with an inventory database to update stock levels in real-time. When a product's stock falls below a threshold, trigger a restock process by creating a purchase order in QuickBooks or sending a notification to Slack.

- **Access Control Workflow**: Connect CodeREADr with a security system to manage building access. Scan employee badges and use the API to check if they have access permissions. If access is granted, send a webhook to the security system to unlock the door and log the entry in a Google Sheet.
