# Overview

The Shadertoy API opens a window to a universe of visual creations by providing programmatic access to a wealth of shaders created by the Shadertoy community. These shaders are snippets of GLSL code that produce stunning graphics and visual effects. In Pipedream, you can leverage this API to trigger workflows that interact with these shaders, such as retrieving shader information, displaying shader visuals, or even monitoring the latest creations. By combining Shadertoy API with Pipedream's capability to connect to numerous other services, your creative and technical projects can flourish with dynamic, visually rich content.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Shader Showcase on Social Media**: Integrate Shadertoy API with Twitter API to post a daily or weekly shader spotlight. The workflow can fetch a random or the latest shader and share it along with a brief description or creator shout-out, engaging followers with visually captivating content.

- **Personalized Shader Notifications**: Use the Shadertoy API with the Pipedream Cron Scheduler to check for new shaders by a favorite artist or tag. When a new shader is detected, send a notification through email, Slack, or SMS via Twilio. This keeps you updated with real-time alerts on shader releases that match your interests.

- **Dynamic Visuals for Web Applications**: Pair the Shadertoy API with a web app via HTTP / Webhook triggers to embed live shader visuals into your web pages. You can configure a workflow to serve up the latest trending shaders, or shaders tagged with specific themes, providing an ever-changing visual experience for your users.
