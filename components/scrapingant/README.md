# Overview

The ScrapingAnt API allows you to scrape web pages without getting blocked. It can handle JavaScript rendering, cookies, sessions, and can even interact with web pages as if a real person were browsing. Using Pipedream, you can integrate ScrapingAnt with countless other apps to automate data extraction and feed this data into various business processes, analytics tools, or databases.

# Example Use Cases

- **Scrape and Monitor Competitor Pricing**: Extract pricing data from competitor websites and send alerts or log the data when changes are detected. Combine with Pipedream's cron scheduler to run this check regularly.

- **Aggregate News Articles for Trend Analysis**: Scrape news articles from various sources to perform trend analysis or sentiment analysis. Use Pipedream's built-in code steps to process the scraped data, and perhaps send it to a Google Sheets document for further analysis.

- **Automate Job Listings Collection**: Collect job listings from multiple career websites to create a consolidated list of opportunities. Integrate with Slack using Pipedream to send daily digests of new listings to a channel for job seekers.
