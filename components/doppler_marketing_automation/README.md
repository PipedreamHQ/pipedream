# Overview

The Doppler Marketing Automation API allows you to automate email marketing campaigns, manage subscriber lists, and analyze the performance of your email marketing efforts. When integrated with Pipedream, you can craft workflows that respond to events in real-time, sync data across various platforms, and personalize your marketing strategy, all while leveraging the serverless execution environment to scale as needed.

# Example Use Cases

- **Subscriber Segmentation and Targeted Campaigns**: Automate the process of segmenting subscribers based on their behavior by connecting Doppler with a CRM like Salesforce. When a new lead is added or updated in the CRM, it triggers a Pipedream workflow that adds or updates the subscriber in a Doppler's specific list, ensuring targeted campaigns are sent to the right audience.

- **E-commerce Cart Abandonment Follow-ups**: Integrate Doppler with an e-commerce platform like Shopify. Configure a workflow on Pipedream that listens for cart abandonment events and automatically sends a personalized follow-up email via Doppler, encouraging the potential customer to complete their purchase.

- **Event-driven Content Delivery**: Pair Doppler with a scheduling app like Google Calendar. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers an email campaign in Doppler whenever a new event is added to a specific Google Calendar, delivering timely content related to the event, such as webinar details, to your subscribers.
