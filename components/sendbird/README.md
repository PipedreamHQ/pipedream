# Overview

The Sendbird API provides programmatic access to advanced chat features, enabling the creation and management of in-app messaging for community forums, customer support, or any other chat-based interaction. By leveraging the Sendbird API on Pipedream, you can automate user management, message and channel handling, and event tracking. Pipedream's serverless platform simplifies these automations, offering a way to integrate chat functionalities with other services, trigger workflows from chat events, and handle real-time data processing without writing extensive infrastructure code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Chat Users with CRM**: Automatically sync new user registrations from Sendbird to a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system like Salesforce. When a user signs up in Sendbird, a workflow triggers that adds or updates the user's information in Salesforce, ensuring customer records are always up-to-date.

- **Moderate Chat Content**: Implement real-time chat moderation by connecting Sendbird with a content moderation service like WebPurify. Each message sent within Sendbird can trigger a Pipedream workflow, which then passes the message to WebPurify for review. If the message is flagged, take action such as notifying moderators, deleting the message, or suspending the user.

- **Aggregate Chat Metrics**: Collect and visualize chat analytics by sending conversation data from Sendbird to a dashboard tool like Google Sheets or Data Studio. Use Pipedream workflows to capture message counts, user engagement metrics, or support response times, then push that data into the dashboard app for real-time reporting and insights.
