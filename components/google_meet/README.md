# Overview

The Google Meet API isn't directly available on Pipedream, but you can automate aspects of Google Meet using Google Calendar API, as Meet links are often generated for Calendar events. With Pipedream, you can create workflows that trigger on specific events, like new calendar events, and take actions like sending notifications with the Meet link or logging event details to a database. Pipedream's serverless platform supports complex sequences and integrates with other services for enhanced functionality.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Meeting Notifications**: Send a notification via email, Slack, or other communication platforms when a new Google Calendar event with a Google Meet link is created. You can use this workflow to ensure participants receive a reminder with the Meet link right before the meeting starts.

- **Meeting Analytics Collection**: Log Google Meet event details from Google Calendar to a Google Sheet or database, like Airtable, whenever a new event is added or modified. This information can be used for tracking attendance, meeting occurrences, or for billing purposes if you're consulting.

- **Pre-Meeting Prep Workflow**: Automatically create and share an agenda in Google Docs with all participants when a Google Meet event is scheduled. This workflow can connect Google Calendar, Google Docs, and an email service to streamline meeting preparations.
