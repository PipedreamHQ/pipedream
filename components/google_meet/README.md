# Overview

The Google Meet API allows developers to automate aspects of the video conferencing service, like creating and managing meetings. With Pipedream, these capabilities can be leveraged to build custom workflows, integrating Google Meet with other services to streamline scheduling, notification, and management processes. For instance, you can automate the creation of meetings in response to calendar events, sync meeting details with a CRM, or initiate follow-up actions once a meeting concludes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Meeting Scheduler:** Sync Google Calendar events with Google Meet to automatically create meetings for new calendar events. Use Pipedream to listen for new events on a Google Calendar and then use the Google Meet API to set up corresponding video conferences, sending invites to participants.

- **Meeting Minute Distribution:** After a meeting ends, use Pipedream to trigger a workflow that sends out the meeting recording and summary to all participants via email. This can be done by integrating Google Meet with an email app like Gmail, capturing the end of meeting event, and distributing the necessary follow-up materials.

- **CRM Integration for Customer Calls:** When a new meeting is scheduled with a customer, use Pipedream to log the event to your CRM, like Salesforce. This workflow can automatically create a new activity or log within the CRM whenever a Google Meet invite is sent, ensuring sales teams have up-to-date information on customer interactions.
