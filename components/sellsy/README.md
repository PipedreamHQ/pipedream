# Overview

The Sellsy API allows you to automate and enhance your customer relationship management and sales processes. Via Pipedream, a serverless integration and automation platform, you can leverage the API to sync data, trigger workflows based on specific actions within Sellsy, and connect Sellsy with a multitude of other services to streamline operations, enhance user engagements, and optimize sales activities.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Onboarding Emails**: Once a new sale is recorded in Sellsy, use Pipedream to trigger an automated email sequence via SendGrid or Gmail to welcome the customer and provide them with useful information about their purchase. This helps in personalizing customer interaction without manual effort.

- **Sync New Contacts to CRM**: When a new contact is added in Sellsy, automatically add that contact to a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot using Pipedream. This ensures all customer data are up-to-date across all platforms, enhancing data consistency and availability for sales teams.

- **Real-time Inventory Updates**: Set up a workflow in Pipedream that monitors changes in inventory levels within Sellsy. Connect this workflow to a messaging app like Slack to send real-time alerts to relevant teams when stock levels are low. This can help in maintaining optimal inventory levels and improving order fulfillment times.
