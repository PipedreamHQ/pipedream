# Overview

The Philips Hue API offers rich control over Philips Hue smart lighting systems. Via Pipedream, you can automate your lighting based on various triggers â€“ think syncing lights with the sun's cycle, changing color to indicate new emails, or even integrating with motion sensors for a smart-home experience. With Pipedream's capabilities to connect to countless services, the possibilities of creating personalized lighting scenarios are vast, limited only by your imagination and the availability of triggers or events from other services and devices.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sunset/Sunrise Lighting**: Adjust your Philips Hue lights to gradually turn on as the sun sets and dim as the sun rises by integrating with a weather API on Pipedream. This automation can mimic natural lighting and provide a gentle transition into and out of the day.

- **Email Notification Lights**: Get visual notifications for new important emails by connecting your Philips Hue lights to your email service on Pipedream. Set up a workflow where lights blink or change color when an email from a VIP list comes in, allowing you to stay informed without constantly checking your inbox.

- **Smart Home Security**: Enhance your home security system by linking Philips Hue with motion sensors through Pipedream. Program your lights to turn on or change color if unexpected motion is detected after certain hours, potentially deterring unwelcome visitors and alerting you to check your security cameras.
