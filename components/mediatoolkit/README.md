# Overview

Mediatoolkit is a powerful media monitoring tool that tracks online mentions of your brand or keywords across various platforms, helping you stay on top of public perception and industry trends. Using the Mediatoolkit API on Pipedream, you can automate reactions to these mentions, aggregate data for analytics, and integrate notifications into other apps to keep your team informed. This enables real-time media monitoring, sentiment analysis, and enhances your ability to respond swiftly to the social sentiments affecting your brand or market.

# Example Use Cases

- **Instant Alerting for Brand Mentions**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream that monitors for brand mentions using the Mediatoolkit API. When a mention is detected, it triggers a notification through email, SMS, or Slack, allowing your team to promptly see and react to what's being said about your brand.

- **Sentiment Analysis and Reporting**: Use Mediatoolkit to fetch mentions and carry out sentiment analysis using an AI service like Google's Natural Language API. Analyze the sentiment of each mention and summarize the data in a weekly report, which can be automatically generated and sent to stakeholders via a tool like Google Sheets or email.

- **Competitor Monitoring and Analysis**: Configure a Pipedream workflow that uses Mediatoolkit to track mentions of competitors. This data is then filtered and sorted according to relevance or sentiment and pushed into a CRM like Salesforce or a project management tool like Trello, where your marketing team can strategize and take action based on the insights gained.
