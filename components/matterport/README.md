# Overview

The Matterport API enables developers to harness the power of 3D spatial data, constructing immersive experiences and automating real estate, retail, and hospitality processes. With APIs allowing access to space details, models, and dimensions, users can integrate Matterport's capabilities into various applications, streamlining workflows such as virtual tour creation, space management, and asset documentation on Pipedream's serverless platform.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Real Estate Listing Updates**: Integrate Matterport with a real estate platform like Zillow using Pipedream. When a new 3D model is uploaded to Matterport, trigger a workflow to automatically update the property listing on Zillow with the latest virtual tour link and images, ensuring potential buyers receive real-time property views.

- **Enhanced Customer Support with Slack**: Connect Matterport to Slack through Pipedream. Whenever a customer requests a virtual tour within a support ticket, trigger an automated message to the support team's Slack channel with the relevant Matterport space details and direct links, improving response times and customer engagement.

- **Scheduled Asset Documentation Backup**: Use Pipedream to pair Matterport with cloud storage services like Google Drive. Set up a workflow that periodically retrieves the latest 3D models and measurements from Matterport and stores them in a designated Google Drive folder, providing a secure and automatic backup solution for digital asset management.
