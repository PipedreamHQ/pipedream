# Overview

The HUB Planner API is a toolset for managing resources, projects, and bookings in a visual and interactive way. By using the API with Pipedream, you can automate complex workflows, sync data across multiple platforms, and create custom integrations to streamline operations. From scheduling resources to analyzing project data, the opportunities are vast for enhancing project management efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Resource Availability Notifications**: Use the HUB Planner API to monitor the availability of resources and trigger notifications. For instance, when a resource becomes available, Pipedream can send an automated Slack message to the relevant project manager, nudging them to allocate the resource to an impending project.

- **Project Time Tracking Integration**: Integrate HUB Planner with a time-tracking app like Toggl. Whenever a booking is made or updated in HUB Planner, Pipedream can capture the event and log the hours directly into Toggl, ensuring that time tracking is up-to-date across systems.

- **Automated Reporting**: Create workflows that automatically generate reports based on bookings and resource utilization data from HUB Planner. These reports can be compiled into a Google Sheets document and emailed weekly to stakeholders, providing consistent insights into resource management.
