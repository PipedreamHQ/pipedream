# Overview

The Chargify API enables seamless integration of subscription billing, management, and reporting functionalities. With Chargify, you can automate the creation and management of customer subscriptions, handle invoicing, apply taxes, and track analytics related to your billing processes. It's a powerful tool for businesses with recurring revenue models to keep their billing systems in sync with other business operations, reducing manual workload and increasing efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated New Customer Onboarding**: Trigger a workflow when a new customer subscribes via Chargify. Capture their details, create an account in your CRM (like Salesforce), send a personalized welcome email using an email platform (like SendGrid), and notify your team on Slack.

- **Dunning Management Automation**: Set up a workflow that listens to payment failure events from Chargify. When a payment fails, automate outreach with a series of emails through an email service like Mailgun to remind customers of their payment obligations. Simultaneously, log the incident in a customer service platform like Zendesk for follow-up.

- **Subscription Analytics Reporting**: Create a daily scheduled workflow that fetches subscription data from Chargify and compiles key metrics into a report. Use this data to update a live dashboard in Google Sheets or Data Studio, providing your team with up-to-date insights on revenue and customer churn.
