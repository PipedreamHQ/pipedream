# Overview

The E2B API provides streamlined access to exchange data between currencies and cryptocurrencies, delivering real-time rates, historical data, and conversion across multiple currencies. It supports a broad range of currencies and offers capabilities crucial for businesses dealing in multiple currencies or developing financial applications needing currency data.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Currency Conversion for E-commerce**: Use E2B within a Pipedream workflow to automatically convert product prices into the customer's local currency at checkout. This can be enhanced by integrating with e-commerce platforms like Shopify or WooCommerce, ensuring that every international customer sees their own currency, improving user experience and potentially increasing conversion rates.

- **Financial Reporting and Analytics**: Build a workflow on Pipedream that leverages the E2B API to fetch historical exchange rates daily. Store this data in a database like PostgreSQL or send it to a data visualization tool like Tableau or Google Sheets for detailed financial analysis and reporting. This is valuable for businesses that need to perform currency normalization to consolidate financial statements from different countries.

- **Dynamic Pricing Model in Apps**: Integrate the E2B API in a Pipedream workflow to update your app's pricing based on the latest exchange rates. This can be crucial for subscription-based services that charge users in multiple currencies. Combine with Stripe for billing automation, ensuring that prices are always accurate and fair according to global currency fluctuations.
