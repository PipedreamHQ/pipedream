# Overview

The Breathe API integrates HR management features into your Pipedream workflows, enhancing automation related to employee details, leave management, and performance metrics. By leveraging this API, you can automate routine HR tasks, synchronize employee information across platforms, and trigger actions based on HR events, leading to increased efficiency and streamlined operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Employee Onboarding**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a new employee is added in Breathe. Automatically send welcome emails via SendGrid, create accounts in services like Slack or GitHub, and add the new hire to a Google Sheet for tracking.

- **Leave Request Notification and Approval System**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers when an employee submits a leave request in Breathe. Notify managers via Slack or email, and allow them to approve or reject the request directly through these platforms. Update the leave status in Breathe based on the manager's response.

- **Synchronize Employee Data with a CRM**: Whenever employee details are updated in Breathe, trigger a workflow in Pipedream to reflect these changes in a CRM like Salesforce. Ensure that sales teams have up-to-date contact information and role details for all internal communications.
