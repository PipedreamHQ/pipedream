# Overview

The GoTo Webinar API enables you to automate interactions with your webinars on GoTo Webinar. With this API, you can create, update, and retrieve your webinars, manage registrants, send reminders, and extract analytics data, all through programmatic means. Integrating it with Pipedream, you can build powerful workflows that trigger on specific events, take action using the API, and connect with other apps to streamline your webinar management process.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Webinar Creation and Setup**: Use the GoTo Webinar API on Pipedream to automatically schedule new webinars, set up registration fields, and customize follow-up emails. You can trigger this workflow by a new event in your calendar app or upon receiving an incoming webhook from your custom app.

- **Sync Registrants to a CRM**: Automatically add new GoTo Webinar registrants to your CRM, such as Salesforce or HubSpot. When someone registers for a webinar, the workflow triggers and pushes their contact information to your CRM, ensuring your sales team has the latest leads at their fingertips.

- **Post-Webinar Engagement**: After a webinar concludes, trigger a workflow that sends a follow-up email with a survey link, adds the participant to a re-engagement campaign, or enrolls them in further educational content. Integrate with Mailchimp or another email marketing service to personalize the follow-up experience.
