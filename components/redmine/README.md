# Overview

The Redmine API allows for integration with the Redmine project management tool, enabling the automation of tasks like issue tracking, project management, and time tracking. Using Pipedream, you can create workflows that trigger on specific Redmine events or perform actions in Redmine based on triggers from other apps. By harnessing the Redmine API on Pipedream, you can connect Redmine with a multitude of other apps and services to streamline your project management processes.

# Example Workflows

- **Sync Redmine Issues to Google Sheets**: Automatically export newly created or updated Redmine issues to a Google Sheets spreadsheet for advanced reporting or data analysis. This workflow can be set up to run periodically, ensuring your Sheets are always up-to-date with the latest issue data.

- **Slack Notifications for Redmine Updates**: Set up a workflow where updates to issues or projects in Redmine trigger notifications in a designated Slack channel. This keeps your team informed in real-time about important changes, like status updates or newly assigned tasks.

- **GitHub Commit Linked to Redmine Issues**: Whenever a new commit is pushed to a GitHub repository, search for Redmine issue IDs in the commit message and update the corresponding issue with the commit details. This helps maintain a clear link between code changes and project tasks.
