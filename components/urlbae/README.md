# Overview

The UrlBae API lets you shorten URLs, making them easier to share and manage. You can generate compact links, track clicks, and gather data on link engagement within your workflows on Pipedream. By leveraging UrlBae in Pipedream, you can automate the process of creating, distributing, and analyzing short links across various platforms, enhancing both marketing efforts and user experience.

# Example Use Cases

- **Shorten URLs on Form Submission**: When a new form response is received via Typeform or Google Forms, automatically shorten any included URLs before storing them in a Google Sheet or sending them in an email digest.

- **Tweet Shortened Links**: After publishing a new blog post, use the RSS Trigger to capture the URL, then shorten it with UrlBae before posting an update to Twitter with the compact link, making the tweet cleaner and tracking click-through rates.

- **Aggregate Click Data**: Schedule a Pipedream job to periodically retrieve click statistics for your UrlBae short links and save them to a Data Store. Use this data to create a dashboard in Google Data Studio or Tableau, giving insights into link performance.
