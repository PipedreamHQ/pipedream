# Overview

The Bidsketch API offers a gateway to streamline your proposal creation and management process. It empowers users to automate the drafting of proposals, maintain client data, and track proposal statuses without the manual hassle. With Pipedream, you can connect Bidsketch to a multitude of other apps, crafting workflows that trigger actions based on events such as proposal acceptance or comment additions, thus ensuring timely follow-ups and efficient client interaction.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Proposal Follow-Ups**: When a proposal is viewed by a client, trigger an email or SMS to remind them to provide feedback or ask if they have any questions. This can be done by integrating Bidsketch with email and SMS services like SendGrid or Twilio on Pipedream.

- **Instant Notification on Proposal Approval**: Set up an instant alert via Slack or another messaging platform when a proposal is approved. This can keep your sales team in the loop and initiate the next steps in the onboarding process swiftly.

- **Sync Proposal Status with CRM**: Whenever a proposal status changes, the workflow can update the deal stage in a CRM like Salesforce, keeping sales pipelines up-to-date without manual data entry.
