# Overview

The Foursquare API gives developers access to the Foursquare database of venues
and users. With the API, developers can build applications that allow
Foursquare users to check in to venues, find nearby venues, get
recommendations, and more.

Here are some examples of what you can build with the Foursquare API:

- An app that allows users to check in to venues and share their location with
  friends
- A venue discovery app that recommends nearby places to eat, drink, and shop
- A social network for foodies that lets users share photos and reviews of
  dishes they've tried
- A travel app that helps users find things to do and see in different cities
