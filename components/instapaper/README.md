# Overview

The Instapaper API offers a streamlined way to interact with saved articles. With it, you can automate your reading list management by adding new items, moving through folders, or marking them as read or unread. Integrating the Instapaper API with Pipedream lets you create custom workflows, triggering actions in Instapaper or other apps based on specific conditions or schedules.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Digest Delivery**: Combine Instapaper with an email service like SendGrid on Pipedream. Automate a weekly digest by collecting articles saved in Instapaper over the week and emailing the list to yourself or your team.

- **Read-Later Archive**: Integrate Instapaper with cloud storage services like Dropbox. Automatically archive articles marked as read in Instapaper to a dedicated Dropbox folder for long-term storage and retrieval.

- **Social Media Sharing**: Link Instapaper with Twitter through Pipedream. Whenever you highlight a passage in an article on Instapaper, automatically tweet the quote with a link to the article, sharing insightful snippets with your followers in real time.
