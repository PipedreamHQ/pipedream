# Overview

iAuditor by SafetyCulture API allows you to tap into a rich reservoir of safety and quality inspection data, enabling you to automate workflows around inspection management. With this API on Pipedream, you can create custom integrations to trigger actions based on audit completions, new issues, or updates in iAuditor. Streamline safety processes, connect with other tools, and manipulate inspection data to fit your needs.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Issue Tracking**: Integrate iAuditor with a project management tool like Jira on Pipedream. When an audit identifies a new issue, automatically create a Jira ticket, ensuring prompt attention from the responsible teams.

- **Sync Inspection Data to a Database**: Set up a workflow that triggers when an audit is completed. The workflow processes the results and syncs them to a cloud database like Google Sheets or AWS DynamoDB for advanced reporting and analysis.

- **Real-Time Notifications for Audits**: Connect iAuditor to communication platforms such as Slack or Microsoft Teams. When an audit is completed or an issue is flagged, send an instant notification to a designated channel, keeping the team informed and responsive.
