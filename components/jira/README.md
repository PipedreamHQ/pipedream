# Overview

With the Jira API, you can create custom integrations to automatically track
and manage issues in Jira. For example, you could create a custom integration
that:

- Automatically creates Jira issues when new items are added to a specified RSS
  feed
- Tracks all changes made to a Jira issue in a database
- Sends a notification to a specified Slack channel whenever a Jira issue is
  updated
- Creates a new Jira issue when a customer submits a support ticket
