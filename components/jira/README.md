-  Automatically creates Jira issues when new items are added to a specified RSS feed

-  Tracks all changes made to a Jira issue in a database

-  Sends a notification to a specified Slack channel whenever a Jira issue is updated

-  Creates a new Jira issue when a customer submits a support ticket
