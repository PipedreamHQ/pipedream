# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Contacts to Google Sheets**: Automatically export new or updated contacts from SugarCRM to a Google Sheet for easy sharing and data analysis. This workflow triggers each time a contact is created or modified in SugarCRM.

- **Customer Support Ticket Creation**: Create a support ticket in a tool like Zendesk or Help Scout whenever a case is updated in SugarCRM with a specific status, ensuring that customer support is promptly notified and can act quickly.

- **Lead Score Enhancement with Clearbit**: Enrich lead data in SugarCRM by pulling in additional information from Clearbit whenever a new lead is added. Use the enriched data to score and prioritize leads more effectively for sales follow-up.
