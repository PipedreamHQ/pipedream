# Overview

The WisePops API unlocks potent possibilities for automating pop-up and banners management on your website. By integrating WisePops with Pipedream, you can streamline workflows such as syncing lead data to CRM platforms, personalizing visitor engagement based on real-time analytics, and dynamically updating marketing campaigns. The API's ability to fetch, update, create, and delete pop-ups enables developers to orchestrate sophisticated marketing automation that reacts to customer behavior and data-driven insights.

# Example Use Cases

- **Dynamic Pop-Up Content Based on User Behavior**: Use customer interaction data from your website to dynamically update WisePops pop-up content. By connecting the WisePops API to website analytics on Pipedream, you can tailor pop-up messages based on user behavior, such as displaying a discount code to a user who has visited multiple product pages.

- **Synchronized Leads Management**: After capturing leads through WisePops pop-ups, automatically feed this data into your CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot using Pipedream. This workflow can enrich lead profiles, trigger follow-up emails, and score leads based on the interaction with the pop-up, ensuring seamless lead nurturing.

- **Real-Time Campaign Performance Adjustment**: Link WisePops with a real-time analytics tool, such as Google Analytics, via Pipedream to enable immediate responses to campaign performance data. If a pop-up underperforms, trigger an A/B test with an alternate version or adjust its targeting criteria, all automated through Pipedream workflows.
