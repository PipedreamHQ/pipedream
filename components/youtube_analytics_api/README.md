# Overview

Google's YouTube (Analytics API) allows developers to extract insights and
valuable analytics data from their YouTube channels. By using the YouTube
Analytics API, developers can create comprehensive reports and analysis tools
that show how content is performing on YouTube. With this powerful API,
developers can create applications that measure audience engagement, understand
how videos impact an audienceâ€™s behavior, and analyze how audience demographic
influences viewership.

Below are just a few examples of the powerful and comprehensive analytics
solutions you can build with the YouTube (Analytics API):

- Track and segment user engagements with videos and channels.
- Monitor and compare user engagement with different types of content.
- See the demographic breakdown of your viewers.
- Measure audience retention and monitor the impact of different strategies.
- Analyze how content virality affects overall viewership.
- Insight into viewer attention and viewership for individual videos and
  channels.
- Detect anomalies and gauge overall performance of content over time.
- Predict how various changes (e.g. content optimizations) will impact
  viewership.
