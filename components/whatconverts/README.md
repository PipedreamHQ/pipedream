# Overview

The WhatConverts API allows you to track, manage, and report on leads and conversions from various marketing channels. With this API, you can automate the ingestion of lead data into your CRM, generate custom reports, and receive real-time alerts for new leads. When you implement this API within Pipedream, you can create powerful, serverless workflows that respond to events in WhatConverts, or trigger actions based on data from other apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Leads to Google Sheets**: When a new lead is tracked in WhatConverts, use Pipedream to add the lead details to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This workflow enables a live overview of leads for team members who manage them in Google Sheets.

- **Create CRM Tasks for New Leads**: For each new lead captured by WhatConverts, create a task in a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. This ensures timely follow-up by sales teams, and keeps all lead information centralized.

- **Send Slack Notifications for Qualified Leads**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that sends a message to a designated Slack channel when a lead meets certain qualification criteria in WhatConverts. This can help sales teams prioritize and respond quickly to high-potential leads.
