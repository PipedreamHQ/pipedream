# Overview

The FormPress API allows you to create and manage forms dynamically, without needing a backend to process submissions. You can integrate FormPress with Pipedream to automate processes such as capturing form submissions, organizing data, triggering notifications, and connecting responses to various apps or services. Pipedream's serverless platform makes it simple to handle FormPress events and incorporate them into workflows, saving time and eliminating the need to manage infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Collection and Storage**: Capture form submissions from FormPress and automatically store the data in a Google Sheet. Use this workflow to organize survey results, registration details, or feedback.

- **Dynamic Response and Notification**: Trigger an email or SMS notification using Twilio or SendGrid when a new form submission is received. This can be useful for order confirmations, support ticket creation, or immediate follow-ups on inquiries.

- **Integration with CRM Systems**: On form submission, instantly create or update contacts in your CRM such as Salesforce or HubSpot. This workflow ensures your sales or support teams have real-time information for leads or support requests.
