# Overview

The Viral Loops API enables you to tap into the potent capabilities of referral marketing within your applications. Using this API through Pipedream, you can automate campaign management, participant tracking, and reward allocation. You can also trigger actions based on referral achievements or new participant sign-ups, making it simpler to manage marketing campaigns and analyze their performance in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Syncing New Referral Participants to a CRM**: Automatically add new participants from your Viral Loops campaigns to a CRM like HubSpot, ensuring your sales team has the latest leads to follow up on.

- **Distributing Rewards with Stripe**: When a participant reaches a referral milestone, trigger a workflow to issue a discount or credit via Stripe, incentivizing further engagement and customer loyalty.

- **Email Notifications for Campaign Updates**: Set up a workflow to send out email alerts through SendGrid whenever there's a significant update in your campaign's performance, such as reaching a participant threshold or achieving a certain number of referrals.
