# Overview

The Feedbin API provides an interface to manage and interact with a user's RSS feed subscriptions and articles. By integrating with Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create automation workflows that enhance your reading experience, keep you informed, and integrate your favorite feeds with other services. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can set up triggers based on new articles, organize content, and synchronize your Feedbin data across multiple applications.

# Example Use Cases

**Automated Article Digest Email**

- Gather new articles from your Feedbin subscriptions using a Pipedream trigger. Combine these articles into a digest and send it daily or weekly via an email service like SendGrid. This can keep you updated with your favorite content in a consolidated manner.

**Content Sharing Workflow**

- Whenever a new article is starred in Feedbin, trigger a Pipedream workflow to share the article on social media platforms such as Twitter or LinkedIn. This allows for seamless sharing of interesting reads with your followers.

**Sync Read Articles to Notion**

- Use Pipedream to monitor articles you've marked as read in Feedbin. Automatically create a corresponding entry in a Notion database for each read article. This is useful for keeping a personal archive of content you've engaged with, along with any notes or summaries you may want to add.
