# Overview

The Unstructured API allows developers to process and extract data from unstructured documents. This can include parsing text from PDFs, images, and other document formats to retrieve actionable data. By using this API with Pipedream, you can automate workflows that require interpretation of varied data formats, seamlessly integrating extracted data into databases, CRM systems, or custom applications.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing**: Automate the extraction and processing of invoice data from unstructured formats like scanned PDFs. Use the Unstructured API on Pipedream to parse invoice details and then integrate with accounting software like QuickBooks to update financial records and trigger payment processes.

- **Customer Onboarding Documents Analysis**: Streamline the process of new customer onboarding by automatically extracting information from uploaded documents such as IDs or application forms. The data can then be fed into a CRM like Salesforce, or used to perform background checks and update internal records.

- **Real-time Contract Review Notifications**: Set up a workflow that monitors an email inbox for incoming contracts in unstructured formats. Use the Unstructured API to extract key terms and clauses and compare them against predefined criteria. If discrepancies or important terms are detected, notifications can be sent out via Slack or email to relevant parties to prompt review or action.
