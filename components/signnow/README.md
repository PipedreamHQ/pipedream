# Overview

The signNow API on Pipedream allows you to automate document signing workflows, manage users, and integrate seamless electronic signature functionalities into various business processes. By leveraging this API, you can create, update, and track documents requiring signatures, automate reminders, and manage signing orders programmatically. This integration can significantly streamline how documents are handled, reduce manual efforts, and expedite the decision-making processes across departments like HR, legal, sales, and procurement.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Generation and Dispatch**: When a new client is added to your CRM (like Salesforce), automatically generate a contract using predefined templates in signNow, send it to the client for signature, and store the signed document back in Salesforce. This workflow can streamline client onboarding and ensure all contractual documents are managed and stored systematically.

- **HR Onboarding Document Management**: Trigger the creation and signing process of onboarding documents whenever a new employee record is added to an HR system like BambooHR. Completed documents can be archived in a secure cloud storage like Google Drive and the HR database updated accordingly, ensuring a smooth and compliant onboarding process.

- **Real-time Contract Status Updates to Slack**: Set up a workflow where any update to the status of a document in signNow (e.g., signed, declined, or expired) triggers an instant notification in a dedicated Slack channel. This keeps relevant teams informed in real-time about critical contractual processes, enhancing communication and response times.
