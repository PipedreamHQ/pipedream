# Overview

The signNow API on Pipedream allows for automation of document preparation, signing, and management processes. It integrates seamlessly with Pipedream's serverless platform to connect with hundreds of other apps for enhanced workflow automation. This API is especially useful for creating streamlined document workflows in legal, HR, and sales departments, automating tasks like sending documents for signatures, retrieving signed documents, and updating databases with signing status.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Deployment and Signature Collection**: Automatically send out contracts when a new client is added to your CRM system. For instance, integrate signNow with Salesforce on Pipedream. When a new contact is added in Salesforce, trigger a workflow that auto-fills and sends a contract for signature via signNow, then updates the CRM record with the status of the signature.

- **HR Onboarding Document Management**: Streamline the onboarding process by automatically sending onboarding documents when a new employee record is created in an HR platform like BambooHR. Use signNow to send the documents and track when they are completed and signed. Once signed, trigger a workflow to store the signed documents in a cloud storage solution like Google Drive and update the employee's status in the HR system.

- **Real Estate Closing Document Coordination**: In real estate transactions, timely document signing is crucial. Integrate signNow with a real estate management app like Zillow or a custom database. Set up a workflow that triggers when a closing date is set, sending all necessary documents to the involved parties for signatures. Upon completion, update the database record for the property with the signing status and store signed documents automatically in a secure location.
