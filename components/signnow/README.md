# Overview

The signNow API on Pipedream enables the automation of electronic signature workflows, streamlining document management, and improving compliance procedures. With this API, you can create, update, and monitor the status of documents needing signatures, automate the retrieval of completed documents, and integrate with other enterprise tools to enhance productivity and accelerate business operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Signing Process**: Automatically generate and send contracts for signature when a new client is added to a CRM like Salesforce. Once signed, the contract is saved to a cloud storage service like Google Drive and the CRM record is updated.

- **Onboarding Paperwork Automation**: Streamline employee onboarding by triggering an automated workflow when a new employee record is created in an HR system like BambooHR. Essential documents are sent via signNow for signature, and upon completion, documents are stored in a secure HR management tool like Workday.

- **Real-time Legal Document Tracking and Notification**: Configure a workflow to monitor the status of critical legal documents. When a documentâ€™s status changes to signed, trigger notifications via email or messaging platforms like Slack to relevant parties, ensuring everyone is promptly updated.
