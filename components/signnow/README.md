# Overview

The signNow API on Pipedream enables users to automate document signing processes, manage agreements, and streamline how documents are approved without manual intervention. By integrating the signNow API into workflows, businesses can significantly reduce the time it takes to get documents signed, ensure compliance, and improve document tracking. The API allows you to create new documents for signing, send them to signers, and track their status through webhooks and API calls.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Generation and Dispatch for New Employees**  
  When a new employee is added to an HR system like BambooHR, automatically generate an employment contract via signNow, and send it to the new hire for signing. Once signed, the contract can be stored in Google Drive and a notification sent via email or Slack.

- **On-Demand Legal Document Signing for Client Consultations**  
  During client consultations, lawyers can use an app like Calendly to schedule appointments. After each consultation, generate non-disclosure agreements or service contracts through signNow based on the type of consultation. Email the documents directly to clients for signatures, tracking the status in a CRM like Salesforce.

- **Real Estate Closing Document Management**  
  In real estate transactions, trigger a workflow whenever a new property closing is initiated in a CRM like HubSpot. Use signNow to create and send closing documents to buyers and sellers. Upon completion of the signing process, archive the signed documents in Dropbox and update the CRM status, notifying all parties via SMS or email.
