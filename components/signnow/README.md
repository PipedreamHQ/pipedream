# Overview

The signNow API on Pipedream offers a streamlined approach to automate electronic document signing processes, providing tools for managing e-signature workflows efficiently. Utilize this API to create, send, and manage documents that require signatures, track document status, and automate notifications upon completion. This capability is pivotal for businesses that handle contracts, legal documents, or any paperwork requiring verified approvals, optimizing time and reducing manual errors.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Workflow for New Employees**: When a new employee is added to your HR system (like BambooHR), automatically generate an employment contract using signNow. Once the contract is signed by the employee, store the signed version in a secure cloud storage service like Google Drive and update the employee's records in the HR system to reflect the completion of this step.

- **Client Onboarding for Financial Services**: When a new client form is submitted via your website, trigger a workflow that creates a personalized onboarding packet requiring signatures using signNow. Upon completion, save the signed documents to Salesforce as part of the client's records, and trigger an email notification to the client with next steps, using an email service like SendGrid.

- **Real Estate Closing Document Management**: Automatically generate and send closing documents to clients when a new property listing status changes to 'pending'. Use signNow for signature collection, and once all parties have signed, archive the documents in Dropbox and send a notification to both the real estate agent and client using Twilio SMS, confirming the completion of the process.
