# Overview

The signNow API on Pipedream allows for the automation and integration of electronic signature processes directly within your workflows. This API facilitates the creation, management, and completion of legally binding signatures on documents without requiring manual handling. By leveraging the signNow API on Pipedream, users can automate document workflows, trigger actions based on document status changes, and integrate with other services to streamline document signing processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Generation and Dispatch**: Automatically generate contracts using template data from a CRM like Salesforce when a new customer is onboarded. Once the contract is prepared, use signNow to send it to the customer for signature and track the status directly from Pipedream.

- **HR Onboarding Document Management**: Streamline the employee onboarding process by triggering a series of signNow actions whenever a new employee is added to an HR system like BambooHR. Automatically send employment contracts, NDAs, and other onboarding documents for signature and retrieve the signed documents to store them in cloud storage like Google Drive.

- **Real-Time Alert System for Document Status**: Set up a real-time monitoring system on Pipedream that alerts the relevant team via Slack or email whenever a document reaches a certain status, such as signed, declined, or expired. This ensures immediate action can be taken based on the document status, improving response times and operational efficiency.
