- **Onboarding Process Streamlining**: - When a new employee is added to an HR system like BambooHR, trigger the sending of employment documents through signNow. Once signed, store the completed documents in a secure folder on Dropbox and update the employee's records in the HR system to reflect the completed paperwork.

- **Real-Time Legal Document Updates**: - Set up a workflow where any updates to legal documents in a tool like Google Docs can trigger a new signature request via signNow. Upon completion of signatures, post a notification in a Slack channel dedicated to legal updates to keep relevant parties informed instantly.
