# Overview

The signNow API on Pipedream allows users to automate electronic signature workflows, streamline document management, and enhance overall document signing processes. This integration can be particularly powerful for businesses looking to automate repetitive tasks like document preparation, sending reminders for unsigned documents, and updating CRM systems upon signature completion.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Document Signing Requests**: Automatically send documents for signatures when a new client is added to your CRM system. For example, connect signNow to Salesforce on Pipedream. When a new contact is created in Salesforce, a signNow workflow can be triggered to prepare and send the document to the new contact for signing.

- **Contract Renewal Reminders**: Set up a workflow that tracks the expiration dates of contracts stored in Google Drive. Use Google Sheets to maintain contract details and expiration dates. Two weeks before a contractâ€™s expiration date, trigger a signNow workflow that sends out a renewal contract for signature, ensuring continuous service and legal compliance.

- **Onboarding New Employees**: Simplify the onboarding process by integrating signNow with an HR platform like BambooHR. When a new employee record is added in BambooHR, automatically generate and send necessary onboarding documents through signNow for electronic signature. This can include employment contracts, tax forms, and company policy acknowledgments.
