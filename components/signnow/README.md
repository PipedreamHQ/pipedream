# Overview

The signNow API allows users to automate document signing processes, manage e-signature workflows, and integrate with various data sources to streamline operations. With this API on Pipedream, you can create dynamic workflows that trigger actions in signNow based on events from other apps, manipulate documents programmatically, and sync data across platforms, all within a serverless environment that scales automatically.

# Example Use Cases

- **Contract Signing Automation for New Employees**: - When a new employee record is added to an HR system like BambooHR, trigger a workflow in Pipedream that automatically sends out employment contract documents via signNow for e-signature. Once signed, the documents are saved to a secure cloud storage service like Dropbox.

- **Automated Legal Document Approval Process**: - Set up a workflow where, upon uploading a legal document to a platform such as Google Drive, Pipedream automatically sends a signature request to the necessary parties through signNow. After all parties sign the document, the final signed version is emailed to all stakeholders using Gmail.

- **Real-time Sales Contract Processing**: - Integrate signNow with a CRM like Salesforce. Whenever a new sales deal is closed and marked as won in Salesforce, automatically generate a sales contract in signNow and send it to the customer for signature. Upon completion, update the deal record in Salesforce with the status of the contract.
