# Overview

The signNow API on Pipedream provides capabilities for automating document signing processes, managing documents, and controlling user access. With signNow, you can integrate electronic signature workflows seamlessly into your business processes, enabling legal binding signatures and document management. Leveraging Pipedreamâ€™s capabilities, developers can connect signNow with other apps to automate data flow, notify parties, and synchronize signed documents with other business tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Workflow**: Automatically send a document for signing when a new client is added to a CRM like Salesforce. Once the document is signed in signNow, the signed contract can be stored in Google Drive and the client record updated in Salesforce to reflect the completion of the agreement.

- **Onboarding Automation**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when new employees are added to an HR management system like BambooHR. Automatically send employment documents and NDAs through signNow for signatures. Once completed, store signed documents in Dropbox and send a notification via Slack to the HR team.

- **Invoice Approval Process**: When a new invoice is created in accounting software like QuickBooks, automatically send the invoice via signNow for signature approval from designated managers. Upon signature, update the invoice status in QuickBooks and send a confirmation email to the finance team using SendGrid.
