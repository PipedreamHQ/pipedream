# Overview

The Vapi API delivers voice automation capabilities, letting you build powerful voice response systems. With Vapi, you can automate calls, send voice messages, and create dynamic interactions through speech recognition and text-to-speech. Pipedream's serverless platform allows you to integrate Vapi's API with numerous other services to automate workflows, react to events, and orchestrate complex voice-enabled processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support Calls**: Trigger a Vapi-powered call flow when a customer submits a support ticket via your helpdesk platform. Use the call to collect additional information or provide immediate assistance, updating the ticket with the call details once complete.

- **Voice Survey Campaigns**: Launch a survey campaign where responses are collected via phone calls. Set up a workflow that initiates Vapi calls to a list of contacts, captures their voice responses, and stores the results in a database for analysis.

- **Event Reminder Calls**: Combine Vapi with a calendar app to send out voice call reminders a day before scheduled events. Include details such as event time and location, and offer recipients options to confirm attendance or reschedule.
