# Overview

The WOXO API enables automation of social media content creation and management, transforming spreadsheets into social media posts, widgets, and more. With this API, you can dynamically generate marketing content, schedule posts, and update widgets in real-time, all based on data you control in a spreadsheet. This marries data-driven decision-making with social media management, offering a highly efficient way to engage with your audience.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Social Media Campaigns from Spreadsheet Data**: Create a Pipedream workflow that monitors a Google Sheets document for changes. Whenever new data is added, the WOXO API generates and schedules social media posts across multiple platforms, ensuring your campaigns stay fresh and relevant without manual intervention.

- **Real-time Social Media Metrics Dashboard**: Set up a workflow where the WOXO API fetches your latest social media performance metrics and updates a dashboard widget on your website. Combine this with a cron-triggered Pipedream workflow to refresh the data at regular intervals, giving you and your audience up-to-date insights.

- **Dynamic Content Widgets for E-commerce**: Connect WOXO with your e-commerce platform's API, like Shopify, to turn new product listings into attractive web widgets. When you add products to your Shopify store, Pipedream triggers the WOXO API to create a widget showcasing the latest additions, which can then be embedded on various online channels.
