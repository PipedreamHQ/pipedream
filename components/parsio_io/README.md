# Overview

The Parsio.io API lets you extract valuable data from inbound emails. This means you can pull information like order details, shipping notifications, or contact info from automated emails without manual data entry. In Pipedream, you can use Parsio.io to trigger automated workflows based on the extracted data.

# Example Use Cases

- **Order Processing Automation**: When Parsio.io extracts new order details from incoming emails, Pipedream can automatically create an order in your eCommerce platform, such as Shopify or WooCommerce.

- **Customer Support Ticket Creation**: Extract customer inquiries from emails with Parsio.io and use Pipedream to create support tickets in platforms like Zendesk or Freshdesk, enriching each ticket with the provided contact information and query details.

- **Event Registration Confirmation**: Use Parsio.io to parse registration details from event sign-up confirmation emails. Pipedream can then add these details to a Google Sheets spreadsheet and send personalized confirmation emails via SendGrid or another email service provider.
