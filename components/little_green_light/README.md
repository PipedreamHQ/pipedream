# Overview

The Little Green Light API provides access to a robust donor management platform, allowing for the creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of donor data. With the API, you can automate tasks related to fundraising, event management, and donor engagement. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to construct serverless workflows that trigger on various events, integrate with other apps, and automate repetitive tasks without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Donor Information to Google Sheets**: Whenever a new donor is added in Little Green Light, automatically add their details to a Google Sheet. This workflow can help maintain an up-to-date backup of donor data and facilitate easy sharing and reporting.

- **Automate Thank You Emails**: Send a personalized thank you email via SendGrid or a similar email service when a new donation is recorded in Little Green Light. This workflow ensures donors receive immediate appreciation, enhancing their engagement with your organization.

- **Slack Notifications for Major Donations**: Set up a workflow that sends a notification to a designated Slack channel when a donation above a certain threshold is received. This allows your team to quickly acknowledge and discuss significant contributions.
