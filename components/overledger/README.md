# Overview

The Overledger API by Quant Network allows developers to interact with multiple blockchain networks. It facilitates the creation, reading, and execution of smart contracts and transactions across different blockchains. This API simplifies the complex nature of blockchain interoperability, enabling multi-chain applications (MApps) through a single gateway.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Multi-chain Financial Reporting**: Build a workflow on Pipedream that triggers monthly, pulling transaction data from various blockchains via the Overledger API. Integrate this data with Google Sheets or a similar app on Pipedream to generate consolidated financial reports.

- **Cross-Blockchain Event Monitoring**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to monitor specific events (like transactions or smart contract interactions) across multiple blockchains using Overledger. This can trigger notifications via Slack or email when predefined conditions are met, such as unusual transaction volumes or large transfers.

- **Decentralized Application (DApp) Management**: Develop a workflow in Pipedream that utilizes Overledger to deploy and manage smart contracts across different blockchains. The workflow could, for instance, automatically update or verify contracts on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain when a GitHub repository is updated, using a combination of Overledger and GitHub triggers on Pipedream.
