# Overview

The SMS Alert API on Pipedream allows you to integrate SMS notifications into your workflows. It provides a straightforward method to send text messages, enabling instant communication for alerts, confirmations, or any time-sensitive info. By leveraging Pipedream's serverless platform, you can trigger SMS sends based on a variety of events and connect them to other services for a fully automated process.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Order Notifications**: Automate order confirmation texts by linking an e-commerce platform like Shopify to SMS Alert. When a new order is placed, trigger a workflow that sends a personalized SMS to the customer, confirming their purchase and providing a tracking number.

- **Server Downtime Alerts**: Set up a monitor that checks your server's health at regular intervals using a cron job on Pipedream. If it detects downtime, it triggers the SMS Alert API to send a text to your IT team, so they can act fast to resolve the issue.

- **Appointment Reminders**: Connect your appointment scheduling software, such as Calendly, to SMS Alert. Create a workflow that sends reminder texts to clients a day before their scheduled appointment, reducing no-shows and improving customer satisfaction.
