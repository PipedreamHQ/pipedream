# Overview

The Sendy API allows you to programmatically manage email campaigns, subscribers, and lists. With Pipedream's capabilities, you can leverage Sendy API to create custom workflows that respond to events, synchronize data across platforms, and automate email marketing tasks. Pipedream provides a serverless platform where you can connect Sendy with 3,000+ other apps without writing complex code, harnessing the power of Sendy's features with event-driven programming and API integration.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Subscriber Syncing Between Platforms**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that listens for new user sign-ups on your platform via webhooks, then automatically adds those users as subscribers to a specific list in Sendy. This keeps your email lists up-to-date without manual intervention.

- **Trigger Email Campaigns from CRM Events**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that monitors updates in a CRM like Salesforce. When a lead reaches a certain stage, automatically trigger a Sendy email campaign to that lead. This ensures timely follow-up emails that could help in converting leads into customers.

- **Auto-Respond to Unsubscription Requests**: Implement a Pipedream workflow that handles incoming unsubscription requests. Upon receiving an unsubscribe webhook from your app or website, the workflow can remove the user from the Sendy list and log the action in a Google Sheet for recordkeeping. This helps maintain compliance with email marketing regulations.
