# Overview

Hygraph API allows you to interact with a headless content management system that lets you manage and deliver content across multiple platforms. Leveraging this API on Pipedream, you can automate content creation, update workflows, and synchronize data across various services. You can trigger workflows on content changes, enrich the content with external APIs, or even automate content moderation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Sync with External Storage**: Automatically export new content items from Hygraph to an external storage service like Amazon S3 whenever they are published, ensuring backups and enabling easy distribution.

- **Automated Content Approvals**: Set up a workflow that listens for new content submissions on Hygraph, runs them through a sentiment analysis service to flag negative content, and auto-approves or escalates items based on the results.

- **Multi-Platform Publishing**: When content is updated in Hygraph, use Pipedream to push that content to other platforms like Shopify for product information, or to WordPress for blog posts, keeping all platforms synchronized with the latest updates.
