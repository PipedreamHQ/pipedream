# Overview

The Freshping API allows you to automate uptime and performance monitoring for your websites and web services. By integrating with Pipedream, you can harness this capability to create customized alerts, log incidents, and trigger actions based on the health of your monitored services. This opens up possibilities for proactive maintenance, real-time status updates, and seamless incident management by connecting to various apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Incident Logging to Google Sheets**: When Freshping detects downtime or any performance issues, you can automatically log these incidents into a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This workflow helps maintain an organized record of outages or performance dips, facilitating trend analysis and reporting.

- **Slack Notification for Downtime**: Set up a workflow where Freshping alerts of any detected downtime are instantly pushed as notifications to a designated Slack channel. This keeps your team informed in real-time, enabling swift response to outages and maintaining service quality.

- **Automated Support Ticket Creation**: Integrate Freshping with a ticketing system like Zendesk; every time Freshping detects an issue, automatically generate a support ticket. This ensures that your support team can start working on a resolution as soon as possible, improving response times and customer satisfaction.
