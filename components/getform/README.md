# Overview

Getform is a powerful API that allows you to collect form submissions without any server-side code, making it an excellent tool for static sites. By using Pipedream, you can automate workflows based on form submissions, such as sending data to databases, triggering email notifications, or integrating with various other services for extended functionality. The API facilitates seamless integration of forms into your development process, while Pipedream acts as the engine to connect and automate actions based on the incoming data.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Email Responses**: Trigger an email to the submitter using SendGrid whenever a new form submission is received on Getform. This workflow can enhance user engagement by promptly acknowledging their inquiries or sign-ups.

- **CRM Integration**: On a new form submission, add the submitter's details to a CRM platform like Salesforce. This workflow effectively captures leads and streamlines the follow-up process for sales or customer service teams.

- **Google Sheets Logging**: Append new form submissions to a Google Sheets document. This allows for easy tracking and analysis of submissions over time, without manual data entry.
