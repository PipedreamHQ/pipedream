# Overview

The Softr API unlocks the power to automate and integrate Softr-built web apps with a multitude of external services and internal workflows. With it, you can streamline data manipulation, sync content, or trigger actions based on specific events. Create, update, and fetch data from your Softr applications, and leverage this functionality to enhance user experience, improve operational efficiency, and reduce manual workloads. When used on Pipedream, the API can connect with other apps to create robust, serverless workflows that operate in real-time or on a scheduled basis.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Publishing**: Create a scheduled workflow on Pipedream that pulls the latest content from a CMS like WordPress, formats it, and pushes it to your Softr app. This way, your app, acting as a content portal, is always up to date with fresh articles or posts.

- **Enhanced Lead Management**: Connect Softr to a CRM tool like Salesforce. Each time a new lead is captured on your Softr app, it triggers a Pipedream workflow that automatically adds or updates that lead's info in Salesforce. It ensures that your sales team has the latest data without manual entry.

- **User Feedback Aggregation**: Integrate your Softr app with a messaging app like Slack using Pipedream. When users submit feedback through your Softr app, the workflow triggers and sends a formatted message to a dedicated Slack channel, enabling quick team response and user engagement tracking.
