# Overview

CabinPanda offers a suite of API tools to help you collect and send data from forms or surveys to other services. With it, you can streamline data collection processes, synchronize information across platforms, and create automated workflows to enhance data management. Pipedream's serverless platform can leverage CabinPanda's capabilities to craft custom workflows, such as handling form submissions, updating databases, or triggering events in other apps based on the data received.

# Example Use Cases

- **Form Submission to Email Alert**: When a new form submission is detected by CabinPanda, a Pipedream workflow can automatically send an email notification. This is useful for teams needing instant updates on survey or form entries.

- **Database Update upon Form Entry**: Use CabinPanda to trigger a Pipedream workflow that updates a SQL or NoSQL database whenever a new form submission comes in. This keeps your records up-to-date without manual data entry.

- **Slack Notification for New Responses**: Connect CabinPanda to Slack via Pipedream. Each time a form response is received, post a message to a designated Slack channel, keeping your team informed in real-time.
