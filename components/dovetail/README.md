# Overview

The Dovetail API offers robust tools for qualitative data analysis, allowing users to automate the ingestion, organization, and synthesis of user feedback, research data, and other forms of textual input. On Pipedream, leveraging the Dovetail API means you can integrate with other apps to capture data from various sources, automate analysis, tag and organize data dynamically, and push insights across platforms to drive decision-making processes effectively.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Feedback Collection and Analysis**: Set up a Pipedream workflow where customer feedback from a platform like Typeform or Google Forms is automatically sent to Dovetail. Utilize Dovetail's API to analyze and categorize feedback based on sentiment and keywords, then push summarized insights to a Slack channel dedicated to product development.

- **Research Data Aggregation and Tagging**: Create a workflow that pulls new entries from research tools such as Qualtrics or SurveyMonkey, sends them to Dovetail for tagging using machine learning models trained on your specific research parameters, and then updates a database in Airtable or Google Sheets with tagged and organized entries.

- **Continuous User Experience Improvement**: Configure a workflow where every new support ticket from Zendesk or Intercom is forwarded to Dovetail. Use Dovetailâ€™s analysis capabilities to detect common issues or suggestions, then automatically create GitHub issues or Trello cards for the development team to address or consider in the product roadmap.
