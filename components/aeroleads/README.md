# Overview

AeroLeads API offers a robust solution for automating lead generation and prospecting activities. By leveraging this API on Pipedream, you can streamline the process of finding potential contacts, enriching their data, and syncing with your CRM or marketing tools. To maximize efficiency, you can set up workflows that react to specific triggers, process the data, and perform actions such as creating leads, updating contact lists, and sending personalized outreach emails.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Enrichment for New Subscribers**: When a new subscriber signs up via your website form, you can trigger a workflow that uses AeroLeads to enrich the subscriber's data with additional contact details. The enriched data can then be automatically added to your CRM.

- **Prospect Discovery and Outreach Sequence**: Automate the discovery of new prospects by setting triggers based on specific criteria, such as job title or industry. Use AeroLeads to gather contact info and then employ an email marketing service like SendGrid on Pipedream to dispatch a series of tailored outreach emails.

- **Real-time CRM Syncing**: Keep your sales team up to date by syncing new leads from AeroLeads to your CRM in real-time. Whenever AeroLeads identifies a potential lead, use Pipedream to add or update contact information in your CRM, ensuring your data is always current.
