# Overview

The Bitport API allows you to integrate cloud torrent downloads into your apps and workflows. With Bitport, you can fetch torrents to a secure cloud location and stream them online. This opens up possibilities for automating downloads, orchestrating media collection, or even building custom alerts for completed torrent downloads. On Pipedream, you can connect the Bitport API to various other services to create powerful automation workflows. For instance, you could trigger downloads with webhooks, organize files with cloud storage services, or send notifications through communication platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Torrent Downloading on New RSS Feed Item**: When an RSS feed updates with new content that you're tracking (say, a weekly podcast or video series), you could automatically initiate a torrent download to your Bitport cloud storage. This way, you ensure you never miss an episode and can access it securely from anywhere.

- **Organizing Downloaded Media with Cloud Storage**: After a torrent download is complete, you can move the file to specific folders in Google Drive or Dropbox based on the media type or other characteristics. This helps keep your cloud storage organized without manual intervention.

- **Notification System for Completed Downloads**: Set up a workflow that sends a notification via email, SMS, or a platform like Slack whenever a Bitport download finishes. This alert can help you stay informed about your downloads without constantly checking the status manually.
