# Overview

The Chatbotic API enables the creation and integration of chatbots with various platforms. With this API, you can automate conversations, craft responses based on user input, and manage bot interactions efficiently. When combined with Pipedream's capabilities, you can set up serverless workflows to trigger actions in other apps based on conversations, analyze chat data, and connect your chatbot with a vast array of services to enhance its functionality.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support**: Use Chatbotic to handle initial customer support queries. When a chatbot encounters a complex issue, use Pipedream to escalate the conversation to a human agent on a platform like Slack or Zendesk.

- **E-commerce Bot Transactions**: Integrate Chatbotic with an e-commerce platform like Shopify. When a customer places an order via chat, Pipedream can capture the order details, process the transaction, and update inventory in real-time.

- **Event Registration via Chat**: Set up a Chatbotic bot to handle event registrations. Pipedream can then add the registrant's details to a Google Sheet and send a confirmation email through an email service like SendGrid.
