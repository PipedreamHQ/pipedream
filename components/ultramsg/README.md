# Overview

UltraMsg API offers a suite of messaging capabilities that let you automate WhatsApp messaging. With it, you can send and receive messages, create WhatsApp chatbots, and manage media, enabling a wide range of automated interactions with users. Pipedream acts as a powerful accelerator here, letting you connect UltraMsg to hundreds of other apps to craft custom workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Ticketing System Integration**: When a new WhatsApp message arrives via UltraMsg, trigger a Pipedream workflow that creates a new support ticket in a tool like Zendesk or Jira. Use data from the incoming message to populate the ticket details, ensuring customer queries are promptly and systematically addressed.

- **E-Commerce Order Updates**: Integrate UltraMsg with an e-commerce platform such as Shopify. Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for order status changes, and automatically sends updates to customers on WhatsApp about their order progress, from confirmation to shipping and delivery.

- **Event Reminder System**: Connect UltraMsg to Google Calendar via Pipedream. Whenever a new event is added to a specific calendar, trigger a workflow that sends out reminder messages to a list of participants on WhatsApp, ensuring timely attendance and engagement.
