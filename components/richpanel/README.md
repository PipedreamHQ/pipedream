# Overview

Richpanel is a customer support and live chat platform designed specifically for eCommerce businesses. It allows companies to manage customer support tickets, automate responses, and provide personalized service at scale. By integrating Richpanel with Pipedream, developers can automate workflows involving customer queries, support ticket data, and interactions, thereby enhancing customer service efficiency and effectiveness.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Customer Support Ticket Creation**: When a customer submits a query through a website form, automate the creation of a support ticket in Richpanel. This can be achieved by connecting the form submission webhook to Pipedream, which then calls the Richpanel API to create the ticket. This ensures no customer query is missed and helps in tracking and managing support issues efficiently.

- **Sync Support Tickets with CRM**: Automatically sync new Richpanel support tickets to a CRM like Salesforce. Whenever a new ticket is created in Richpanel, a Pipedream workflow triggers and creates a corresponding record in Salesforce. This keeps sales and support teams in sync, providing a holistic view of customer interactions and enhancing the ability to service customers based on their full interaction history.

- **Aggregate and Analyze Support Data**: Collect data from Richpanel on ticket volume, response times, and resolution rates, and send this data to a tool like Google Sheets or a BI platform such as Tableau for analysis. This automated workflow helps in understanding support performance and identifying areas for improvement in real-time, without manual data entry.
