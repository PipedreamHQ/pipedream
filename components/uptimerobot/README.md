# Overview

Using UptimeRobot API, you can build various tools and automation for server
monitoring, memory and performance tracking, and more. With fewer resources,
you can streamline the process of gathering insights to quickly identify
potential problemsâ€”freeing up more time to focus on delivering an optimal
service.

The UptimeRobot API can help you:

- Monitor web servers and connected systems
- Receive real-time notifications of any potential problems
- Access detailed performance data such as response time, latency, number of
  requests, and more
- Automate tests for alerts and record changes in states
- Analyse trends over time, such as memory or disk usage
- Automate backups or alerts when disk space is low
- Create automatic scaling policies for improved resource allocation
- Monitor system resources and usage over time to detect outages
- Analyze API or network performance across distributed regions
- Automate the rollout of new code releases with zero downtime
