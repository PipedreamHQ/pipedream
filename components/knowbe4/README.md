# Overview

The KnowBe4 API offers a platform for automating and managing the various aspects of a security awareness training program. By tapping into KnowBe4's API on Pipedream, you can streamline user management, phishing simulations, and training campaigns, integrating these into broader IT processes or alerting systems. Tailoring automations can lead to improved response times, comprehensive reporting, and enhanced overall security education within an organization.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated User Provisioning**: Sync new hires from an HR system into KnowBe4 to automatically enroll them in security awareness training. When a new employee is added to your HR system, trigger a Pipedream workflow that adds the user to KnowBe4 and assigns relevant training modules based on their role.

- **Phishing Simulation Analysis**: Connect KnowBe4 with a data visualization tool like Google Sheets or Tableau. Use Pipedream to collect results from phishing simulation campaigns, process the data, and push insights into a dashboard for easy analysis and monitoring of employee susceptibility trends over time.

- **Real-Time Alerting for Training Completion**: Set up a monitoring system on Pipedream that watches for training completions in KnowBe4. When an employee finishes their assigned training modules, trigger a notification through Slack, email, or SMS to their manager or the security team, ensuring compliance and keeping track of the organizationâ€™s security training progress.
