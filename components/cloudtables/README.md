# Overview

CloudTables API allows the creation and manipulation of sophisticated and dynamic data tables in the cloud. With this API, you can manage table schemas, insert, update, and fetch data in real time, and control access with fine-grained permissions. Leveraging CloudTables on Pipedream, you can automate data flows, sync with other services, and respond to eventsâ€”think of it as supercharging your data tables with the power of integration and automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sales Pipeline Management**: Automate the update of a sales pipeline in CloudTables by triggering workflows on Pipedream when new leads are captured in a CRM like Salesforce. Sync new lead details to a specific table, ensuring sales reps have the latest information at their fingertips.

- **Inventory Tracking System**: Connect CloudTables to an eCommerce platform like Shopify. When a product's stock level changes, use Pipedream to update the inventory table in CloudTables automatically. This keeps inventory data accurate across systems without manual intervention.

- **Event Registration Coordination**: Tie in a CloudTables table with an event management app like Eventbrite using Pipedream. When attendees register for an event, add their information to a table. Then, use this data to trigger follow-up emails or create personalized itineraries.
