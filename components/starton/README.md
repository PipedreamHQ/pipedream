# Overview

The Starton API taps into the burgeoning world of blockchain, enabling developers to build applications that interact with smart contracts and manage tokens without deep blockchain expertise. On Pipedream, you can harness this power to create serverless workflows that automate tasks like monitoring smart contract events, managing NFTs, or executing blockchain transactions in response to various triggers from webhooks, schedules, or app events.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated NFT Portfolio Tracking**: Build a workflow that triggers daily, pulling your NFT inventory using the Starton API. Connect this with a data store on Pipedream to track changes over time, and set up an email or Slack notification to alert you when new NFTs are added.

- **Smart Contract Event Monitoring**: Utilize the Starton API to watch for specific events on a smart contract, such as new transactions or fulfillment of certain conditions. When an event occurs, trigger a Pipedream workflow that logs the details to Google Sheets, sends a message with Twilio, or updates a dashboard in Data Studio for real-time monitoring.

- **Conditional Blockchain Transactions Execution**: Create a Pipedream workflow that listens for webhooks from an e-commerce platform. When a new purchase is confirmed, use the Starton API to execute a blockchain transaction, like transferring a token or minting an NFT, as part of the digital product delivery process.
