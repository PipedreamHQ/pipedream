# Overview

The Rapid URL Indexer API allows for the immediate submission of URLs to search engines for indexing. This enables faster visibility of newly published or updated content on the web, crucial for SEO strategies. By incorporating this API into Pipedream workflows, users can automate the indexing process, integrate with content management systems, and monitor the performance of URLs in real-time, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of SEO tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Publication and Indexing Workflow**: When new content is published on a website, trigger a Pipedream workflow from a CMS like WordPress or Contentful. The workflow captures the URL of the newly published content and sends it to the Rapid URL Indexer API to expedite search engine visibility. This ensures that content starts ranking sooner, potentially increasing traffic and engagement.

- **SEO Monitoring and Reactivation**: Set up a Pipedream scheduled workflow to periodically fetch URLs from a database or spreadsheet (like Google Sheets) that monitors key website pages. Use the Rapid URL Indexer API to re-index these URLs, which can be useful for pages that undergo frequent updates. This helps in maintaining SEO rankings and ensuring that the most current version of the page is indexed.

- **Automated Indexing Post-Migration**: After migrating a website or changing its structure, use a Pipedream workflow triggered by the migration tool or directly from a GitHub push if the website is static. Collect all the new URLs and pass them through the Rapid URL Indexer API. This automation can significantly cut down the time it takes for the new URLs to appear in search engine results, reducing the negative impact on SEO during site transitions.
