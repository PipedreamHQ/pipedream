# Overview

The Mailerlite API offers the ability to extend your email marketing efforts through programmatic access to your Mailerlite account. Use it on Pipedream to automate email campaigns, manage subscribers, analyze the results of your outreach, and integrate with your existing tech stack. By crafting workflows on Pipedream, you can connect Mailerlite to a vast array of services, triggering actions based on subscriber behavior, synchronizing data across platforms, or enriching subscriber profiles for targeted campaigns.

# Example Use Cases

- **Subscriber Lifecycle Management**: Automatically add new subscribers to Mailerlite from various sources like Shopify purchases, Typeform form submissions, or Google Sheets entries. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers when a new entry is added to any of these platforms, and use the Mailerlite API to subscribe them to your list, tag them based on their interests, or even trigger a welcome email sequence.

- **Campaign Results to Dashboard**: Post the performance metrics of your Mailerlite email campaigns directly to a business analytics dashboard like Google Data Studio or Tableau. Use Pipedream to schedule a workflow that retrieves campaign statistics from Mailerlite and formats the data before sending it to your preferred dashboard tool, ensuring real-time insights into your email marketing effectiveness.

- **Real-Time Subscriber Engagement**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for updates from Mailerlite, like email opens or link clicks. When a subscriber interacts with your email, use that as a trigger to perform actions in other apps like creating a task in Asana for follow-up, sending a personalized message via Twilio, or logging the event in a CRM like HubSpot for further nurturing.
