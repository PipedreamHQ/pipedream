# Overview

The Amara API provides programmatic access to Amara’s community-driven subtitle creation and translation services. With this API, you can automate subtitle workflows, streamline video content translation, and integrate with other services to create efficient localization processes. The API allows you to manage videos, subtitles, and teams, offering a doorway to effortlessly scaling your video content to reach global audiences.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Subtitle Generation Workflow**: By integrating the Amara API with transcription services like Google Speech-to-Text on Pipedream, you can create a workflow that automatically transcribes spoken language in videos, submits the transcript to Amara for subtitling, and then retrieves and stores the subtitles once they’re ready.

- **Subtitle Sync and Translation Pipeline**: Utilize the Amara API in a Pipedream workflow that monitors your content management system (CMS) for new video uploads. Once a new video is detected, the workflow can automatically upload the video to Amara, trigger the subtitle creation process, and, upon completion, push those subtitles through a translation service like DeepL or Google Translate, then update the CMS with the translated subtitles for various language versions of the video.

- **Team Collaboration Booster**: Create a Pipedream workflow that taps into the Amara API to oversee your subtitle translation projects. Automatically assign tasks to team members based on availability and expertise, notify translators when a new video is ready for their language skills, and track progress through to completion, all while keeping everyone in sync with notifications through communication platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams.
