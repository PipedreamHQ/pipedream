# Overview

NetHunt CRM API is a powerful tool that lets you build custom applications on
top of the NetHunt CRM platform. With the API, you can access data stored in
NetHunt CRM, including contacts, tasks, notes, deals, and more. You can also
use the API to create custom applications that interact with NetHunt CRM data.

The NetHunt CRM API is a REST API, so it can be used with any programming
language that supports making HTTP requests. In addition, the NetHunt CRM API
is fully documented, so you can easily find the information you need to get
started.
