# Overview

The Mailchimp API is a powerful tool that can be used to build all sorts of
applications and integrations. With it, you can manage subscribers, send
emails, and track engagement. Some examples of what you can build with the
Mailchimp API include:

- A desktop application for managing your Mailchimp account
- A mobile app for subscribing to newsletters on the go
- An integration with your CRM system to automatically add subscribers to your
  Mailchimp list
- A web app that allows visitors to sign up for your newsletter right from your
  website

  engaged recently

These are just a few examples of what you can build with the Mailchimp API.
With a little creativity, the possibilities are endless!
