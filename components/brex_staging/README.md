# Overview

The Brex (Staging) API allows you to automate financial operations and integrate with Brex's suite of financial services. This API can be leveraged to synchronize transactions, manage cards, and automate accounting processes, providing real-time insights into your business finances. Using Pipedream, these capabilities can be harnessed to create custom workflows that trigger actions based on financial events, reconcile expenses, and streamline financial reporting.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Expense Reporting**: Track expenses by triggering a Pipedream workflow that listens for new transactions on a Brex card. Once a transaction is detected, categorize the expense and automatically send a report to a Google Sheet for accounting reconciliation.

- **Real-Time Budget Alerts**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that monitors your Brex account balances and transaction activity. When spending approaches a set budget limit, automatically send an alert via email or Slack to the finance team to prevent budget overruns.

- **Streamlined Employee Onboarding**: Automate the process of issuing Brex cards for new employees. When a new employee is added to your HR system (like BambooHR), trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends a request to the Brex API to issue a new card and set spending limits according to their role.
