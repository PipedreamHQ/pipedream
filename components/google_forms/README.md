# Overview

The Google Forms API lets you programmatically access and manipulate your forms and responses. In Pipedream, integrating Google Forms can automate mundane tasks, sync form data with other services, and trigger actions based on submission events. You can create, edit, and collaborate on forms, and analyze responses in real-time combined with Pipedream's serverless platform to create powerful workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Auto-Respond to Form Submissions**: Set up a workflow that sends a customized email to the respondent using the Gmail app whenever a new Google Form submission is received. This can provide immediate engagement and confirm receipt of their responses.

- **Save Submissions to a Spreadsheet**: Automatically add new Google Forms responses to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This workflow streamlines data collection and allows for advanced analysis and reporting capabilities.

- **Sync to a CRM**: On new form submission, use the Pipedream workflow to parse and send the data to a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. This keeps your sales or customer service teams updated with fresh leads or inquiries without manual data entry.
