# Overview

The Google Forms API on Pipedream allows you to interact with Google Forms programmatically. You can automate tasks such as retrieving form responses, creating new forms, or updating existing ones. By integrating Google Forms API with Pipedream's serverless platform, you can build powerful workflows that trigger on form submissions, process the data, and connect with countless other services, all without writing extensive code.

## Example Use Cases

- **Automate Response Collection**: On new Google Forms submissions, trigger a Pipedream workflow that collects responses, parses them, and stores them in a Google Sheet for easy analysis and sharing.

- **Integrate With CRM**: When a form is submitted with a new lead's details, automatically add or update the lead's information in your CRM like Salesforce, ensuring your sales team has the most current data.

- **Send Custom Email Responses**: After a form submission, use Pipedream to generate a personalized email response via SendGrid or Gmail, thanking participants or providing them with additional resources based on their input.
