# Overview

The Harvest API allows developers to programmatically access data and objects in Harvest, a web-based time tracking application. With the API, developers can create applications that submit and retrieve time tracking data, as well as automate various aspects of the Harvest user experience.

Some examples of what you can build using the Harvest API include:

- A time tracking application that automatically submits time tracking data to Harvest on behalf of the user
- A reporting application that retrieves time tracking data from Harvest and presents it in various charts and graphs
- An integration with a third-party project management application that pulls in time tracking data from Harvest to provide a more complete picture of project progress
