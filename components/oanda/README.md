# Overview

The OANDA API enables you to tap into the world of forex trading, providing real-time currency exchange rates, and the ability to automate trading strategies, manage accounts, access market data, and more. On Pipedream, you can craft workflows that capitalize on OANDA's capabilities, such as reacting to market changes, automating trades based on custom logic, and syncing forex data with other business applications for analysis and decision-making.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Trading Strategy**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow when specific forex signals are detected in OANDA. Use conditional logic to place trades automatically back on OANDA when certain technical indicators or price thresholds are met, ensuring timely execution of your trading strategy.

- **Forex Data Sync for Analytics**: Schedule a recurring Pipedream workflow that fetches the latest exchange rates from OANDA and pushes them to a Google Sheets document. Leverage this for ongoing analysis or to fuel business intelligence dashboards that help inform company financial decisions.

- **Market Alert Notifications**: Create a Pipedream workflow that monitors OANDA for significant market events or price movements. When specified conditions are detected, automatically send out alert notifications via email, SMS (Twilio), or messaging apps like Slack to keep you or your team instantly informed about critical market changes.
