# Overview

LambdaTest API on Pipedream allows developers to integrate and automate browser testing directly within their development workflows. Using this API, you can create, manage, and execute Selenium, Cypress, and other tests on a scalable cloud grid, facilitating continuous testing with minimal setup. This integration is especially beneficial for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, enabling teams to ensure that applications perform as expected across multiple browser environments before deployment.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Selenium Test Execution on Code Commit**: Trigger Selenium tests on LambdaTest whenever new code is committed to a GitHub repository. Use Pipedream's GitHub trigger to detect commits, then automatically initiate a series of browser compatibility tests on LambdaTest. This helps ensure that recent changes pass all browser-based tests.

- **Scheduled Browser Compatibility Testing**: Use Pipedreamâ€™s scheduled workflows to initiate browser compatibility tests on LambdaTest at regular intervals, such as nightly or weekly. This is ideal for ensuring ongoing compatibility during long-term projects without needing manual intervention each time.

- **Error Reporting Integration**: Combine LambdaTest with Slack using Pipedream. Configure a workflow where, if a test fails on LambdaTest, an automatic notification is sent to a designated Slack channel. This immediate feedback loop enables teams to quickly address issues, improving both development speed and software quality.
