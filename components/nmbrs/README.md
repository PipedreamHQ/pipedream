# Overview

The Nmbrs API is a powerful tool for managing payroll and HR data. It allows developers to automate the interaction with payroll processes, employee management, and financial reporting systems effectively. Using Pipedream, you can harness this API to automate workflows, sync data across various platforms, and trigger actions based on payroll events, making HR tasks more efficient and less prone to error.

# Example Use Cases

- **Employee Onboarding Automation**: Automatically create new employee records in Nmbrs when a new employee form is submitted through a Google Form. Use Pipedream to capture form data and create corresponding entries in Nmbrs, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately and consistently recorded from the very beginning.

- **Payroll Change Notifications**: Set up a workflow that monitors changes in the payroll data within Nmbrs. Whenever a change is detected, such as an updated salary or bonus payment, trigger an automated notification via Slack to the relevant department heads or finance team, keeping everyone informed in real-time.

- **Monthly Payroll Reports**: Automate the generation and distribution of monthly payroll reports. Connect Nmbrs to Google Sheets via Pipedream to pull payroll data at the end of each month. Then, use this data to populate a report template in Google Sheets, and share it via email with stakeholders, ensuring that payroll insights are communicated efficiently and reliably every month.
