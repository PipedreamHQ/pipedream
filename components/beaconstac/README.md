# Overview

The Beaconstac API allows you to leverage proximity marketing through beacon and QR code technology. By integrating with Beaconstac, you can automate the creation and management of QR codes and beacons, track analytics, and engage users based on location. This aligns perfectly with Pipedream's capabilities, where you can create complex workflows to connect Beaconstac with other apps for efficient, real-time automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Capture at Events**: Automate the process of capturing leads at events by setting up beacons that integrate with a CRM like Salesforce. When attendees scan a QR code or interact with a beacon, Pipedream can add their information directly to Salesforce and trigger a personalized follow-up email via SendGrid.

- **Location-Based Notifications**: Create workflows that send personalized notifications or offers to users when they are near a beacon. Connect Beaconstac to a messaging app like Twilio on Pipedream. When a user enters a beacon's range, trigger an SMS with a special discount or information about nearby products.

- **Analytics Dashboard Synching**: Synch beacon and QR code interaction data to a dashboard application like Google Sheets or Data Studio. Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for Beaconstac webhook events and processes the data to maintain real-time analytics on user interactions, foot traffic, or campaign performance.
