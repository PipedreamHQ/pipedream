# Overview

Beaconstac API can be used to develop a range of BLE-enabled applications for Android and iOS. The API can be used to build apps for beacon management, indoor navigation, targeted content delivery, and proximity-based marketing.

Some examples of applications that can be built using the Beaconstac API include:

- A beacon management app that can be used to configure and manage beacons
- An indoor navigation app that can be used to provide turn-by-turn directions within a building
- A targeted content delivery app that can be used to deliver content to specific users based on their location
- A proximity-based marketing app that can be used to send targeted marketing messages to users based on their proximity to a beacon
