# Example Use Cases

- **Client Onboarding Automation**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a new client is added in Lawmatics. Automate the creation of client files in Google Drive, set up tasks in a project management tool like Trello, and schedule a welcome email through SendGrid.

- **Case Status Update Notifications**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to listen for case updates in Lawmatics. When a case status changes, automatically send a notification via Slack to the responsible attorney, update a shared status dashboard in Google Sheets, and log the update in a database like Airtable for record-keeping.

- **Automated Follow-Up Sequence**: Initiate a sequence of timed follow-up emails through SendGrid when a milestone is reached in a Lawmatics case. Deploy a Pipedream workflow that listens for milestone completions and schedules emails, creates follow-up tasks in Asana for the legal team, and updates the client’s record in Lawmatics with each interaction.
