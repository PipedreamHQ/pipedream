## What's the difference between the **Gmail** app and the **Gmail Developer App**?

Google requires integration platforms such as Pipedream, to restrict the scopes users can enable for Gmail, in order to regulate the ability of users to build workflows and connect applications.

Currently, the **Gmail** app on Pipedream is limited to only sending emails on behalf of your Gmail email address associated with this app.

However, the **Gmail Developer App** is unrestricted because you have the ability to control the scopes through creating your own Google Cloud Project.

Because you can define your own scopes, you can read and write emails with your own Google Cloud Project. To learn how to create and authenticate a **Gmail Developer App** read [our setup guide](https://pipedream.com/apps/gmail-custom-oauth).
