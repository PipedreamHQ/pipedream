## What's the difference between the **Gmail** app and the **Gmail Developer App**?

In Pipedream, the **Gmail** app is an project owned by Pipedream. This means that Google has restricted certain scopes, namely the ability to read email.

Currently, the **Gmail** app on Pipedream is limited to only sending emails on behalf of your Gmail email address associated with this app.

However, the **Gmail Developer App** is unrestricted because you have the ability to control the scopes through creating your own Google Project.

Because you can define your own scopes, you can read and write emails with a Google Project. To learn how to create and authenticate a **Gmail Developer App** read [our setup guide](https://pipedream.com/apps/gmail-custom-oauth).
