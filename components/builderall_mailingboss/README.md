# Overview

The Builderall Mailingboss API empowers you to automate your email marketing operations via Pipedream. You can create, update, and manage contacts and email lists, trigger email campaigns, and analyze campaign performance directly through API calls. Integrating these capabilities within Pipedream’s serverless platform enables you to connect Mailingboss with 3,000+ other apps, streamlining your marketing workflows and data management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Subscribers From Web Forms to Mailingboss**: Capture new leads from a web form (like Typeform), then use Pipedream to automatically add those contacts to a specified email list in Mailingboss. This keeps your email list current without manual input.

- **Trigger Email Campaigns Based on User Activity**: Set up a workflow where user actions on your website or app (monitored via Segment) trigger targeted email campaigns. For instance, if a user abandons their shopping cart, Pipedream can trigger a Mailingboss campaign to re-engage them.

- **Analyze Campaign Performance in Google Sheets**: After sending a campaign, use Pipedream to pull campaign performance data from Mailingboss and append it to a Google Sheet. This allows for easy tracking and analysis of metrics like open rates and click-through rates over time.
