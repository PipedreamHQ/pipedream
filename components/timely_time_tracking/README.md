# Overview

The Timely Time Tracking API lets you automate your time tracking, reporting, and project management tasks. With Pipedream, you can connect the API to create custom workflows that fit your needs without managing infrastructure. You can streamline time entries, sync project data, and trigger actions based on time tracked. Using Pipedream's serverless platform, you can execute code that interacts with Timely's data on a schedule, or in response to HTTP requests or events from other apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Time Tracking Reports**: Generate weekly or monthly time tracking reports and send them via email or store them in Google Sheets. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers on a schedule to fetch time entries from Timely, compile them into a report, and send it through Gmail or save it to Google Sheets.

- **Project Time Budget Alerts**: Create a system that alerts project managers when the time spent on a project approaches its budget. A Pipedream workflow can monitor time entries in Timely, calculate the total time, and when it nears the budget threshold, it can send a notification through Slack or SMS via Twilio to the concerned individuals.

- **Sync Timely Data with Project Management Tools**: Keep your project management tool, like Trello or Asana, in sync with Timely. Use Pipedream to build a workflow that listens for new time entries in Timely, then creates or updates tasks in Trello or Asana with the relevant time data, ensuring all your project information stays up-to-date.
