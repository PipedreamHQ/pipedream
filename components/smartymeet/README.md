# Overview

SmartyMeet API facilitates the scheduling and management of meetings, integrating powerful features like automated scheduling, reminders, and calendar syncing. With this API, users can automate the entire lifecycle of a meeting from initiation to follow-up, directly interfacing with calendars, conferencing tools, and communication platforms to streamline operations. Using Pipedream, these capabilities can be extended to create dynamic, automated workflows that interact with other applications, handle data seamlessly, and improve collaboration efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Meeting Setup with Google Calendar**: Automatically schedule meetings in SmartyMeet and sync them with Google Calendar whenever a new form is submitted on your website. This can be set up to capture client information and preferences, scheduling meetings at optimal times without manual intervention.

- **Meeting Reminder System via SMS with Twilio**: Set up a workflow where SmartyMeet sends meeting details to Twilio, which then sends an SMS reminder to all participants 24 hours before the scheduled meeting time. This ensures higher attendance rates and keeps all participants informed.

- **Post-Meeting Feedback Collection via Email**: After a meeting concludes, trigger an automated email through SendGrid to collect feedback from all participants. This data can be stored in a Google Sheet for analysis, helping to improve future meeting effectiveness and participant satisfaction.
