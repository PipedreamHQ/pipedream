# Overview

The Motion API enables automated interactions with Motion's time management and productivity tools. With Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create custom workflows, syncing Motion's smart scheduling and task management features with other apps and services. The integration possibilities are vast, allowing users to streamline their productivity processes, trigger actions based on calendar events, or consolidate tasks across multiple platforms.

## Example Use Cases

- **Sync Motion Tasks with Google Calendar**
  Create a Pipedream workflow that listens for new tasks in Motion and automatically adds them to your Google Calendar. This ensures that all your tasks are scheduled and you never miss a beat.

- **Aggregate Tasks from Multiple Platforms**
  Whenever you create a task in other apps like Trello, Asana, or Jira, have them automatically added to Motion. Pipedream can act as the bridge, so your Motion list is always comprehensive and up-to-date.

- **Automate Daily Task Digest Emails**
  Set up a Pipedream workflow to compile your Motion tasks at the start of the day and send a digest email via SendGrid or another email service. Kickstart your day with a clear overview of your schedule.
