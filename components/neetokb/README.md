# Overview

The neetoKB API enables integration with neetoKB, a knowledge base management service. It allows you to automate the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of articles, categories, and sections within your knowledge base. On Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create workflows that streamline content management, collaborate with team members, and synchronize data across multiple platforms. Pipedream's serverless platform also offers real-time processing, event-driven triggers, and connections to 3,000+ other apps for extended functionality.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Updates**: When a Google Doc is updated, use Pipedream to trigger a workflow that updates an associated article in neetoKB. This ensures that your knowledge base remains up-to-date with the most recent document changes.

- **Customer Support Ticket Resolution**: Integrate neetoKB with a customer support platform like Zendesk. Whenever a new support ticket is resolved, automatically create or update an article in neetoKB with the solution details, enriching your knowledge base for future reference.

- **Content Approval Workflow**: Set up a workflow that triggers when a draft article is ready for review in neetoKB. Notify team members on Slack to review the content. After approval, the workflow can publish the article to the knowledge base and notify subscribers via email.
