# Overview

The bexio API offers a gateway to streamline administrative tasks linked with small business management. With this API, you can automate processes, sync data across platforms, and enhance efficiency by reducing manual input. Pipedream, with its serverless execution environment, lets you create complex workflows around bexio. You can automate invoicing, manage contacts, monitor projects, and integrate with other services like CRMs, email, and payment gateways.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Creation and Delivery**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a new sale is made in your e-commerce platform. Create an invoice in bexio, email it to the customer, and record the transaction in your accounting software.

- **Dynamic Contact Synchronization**: Sync new contacts between bexio and your email marketing tool. When a new contact is added in bexio, automatically add them to your Mailchimp list, ensuring your marketing campaigns reach all your business contacts.

- **Project Time Tracking Integration**: Link bexio with time tracking apps like Toggl. When a project is created in bexio, set up a corresponding project in Toggl, and when time is logged, reflect this in bexio for accurate and up-to-date project management.
