# Overview

Demio, a webinar platform, offers an API that lets you automate various aspects of your webinar experience. With the Demio API on Pipedream, you can seamlessly integrate webinar registration, attendance tracking, and follow-up actions into your business workflows. Pipedream's serverless platform facilitates the creation of complex automations that can trigger actions based on events in Demio, connecting it with hundreds of other apps for a cohesive ecosystem.

# Example Use Cases

- **Webinar Registration Sync:** Automatically sync new webinar registrations from Demio to your CRM platform, like Salesforce. Each time a new attendee registers for a webinar in Demio, a corresponding lead or contact can be created or updated in Salesforce, keeping all customer touchpoints in sync.

- **Post-Webinar Engagement:** Trigger an email or SMS campaign using SendGrid or Twilio for attendees who participated in a webinar. Using the attendee data from Demio, craft personalized follow-up messages thanking attendees, providing additional resources, or offering special promotions.

- **Attendance-Based Project Management:** Connect Demio to a project management tool like Trello or Asana. After a webinar ends, automatically create tasks for sales or support teams to follow up with attendees based on their participation level, ensuring that no potential lead falls through the cracks.
