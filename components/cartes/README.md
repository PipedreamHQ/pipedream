# Overview

Cartes API allows users to create, update, and share maps with custom markers, making it useful for location-based data visualization. With Pipedream, you can automate interactions with the Cartes API to integrate real-time mapping capabilities into your workflows. For instance, you could track assets, manage event locations, or update a map with user-generated content from various sources. Pipedream's power lies in its ability to connect the Cartes API with 3,000+ other apps to create dynamic, automated workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time Event Mapping**: Automatically update a Cartes map with event locations as they are scheduled in a Google Calendar. Each time a new event is added, a Pipedream workflow triggers and places a marker on the map, providing a visual overview of event hotspots.

- **Customer Feedback Visualization**: When a customer submits feedback through a Typeform survey indicating a location-based issue, a Pipedream workflow adds a marker to a Cartes map. This aids businesses in pinpointing areas with high volumes of customer concerns for targeted service improvements.

- **Asset Tracking System**: Combine Cartes with GPS tracking hardware data. As assets move and report their coordinates through a webhook, Pipedream processes the data and updates their positions on a Cartes map in near real-time, useful for fleet management or logistics.
