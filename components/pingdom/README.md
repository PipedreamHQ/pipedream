# Overview

The Pingdom API offers a suite of endpoints to monitor the uptime, performance, and interactions for websites and web applications. With this API, you can automate the retrieval of monitor statuses, alerts, and performance data. Integrating Pingdom with Pipedream allows developers to create custom workflows that can notify teams of incidents, track performance metrics, or even trigger actions based on website status changes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Incident Response Notifications**: Create a workflow that listens for Pingdom alerts and automatically sends notifications to Slack, alerting your team immediately when a website goes down or experiences performance issues.

- **Performance Metrics Reporting**: Build a workflow where you gather daily performance data from Pingdom and compile a report in Google Sheets. This can help track the uptime trends and response times of your websites over time, providing valuable insights into your web infrastructure's health.

- **Auto-Remediation Triggers**: Set up a workflow that, upon receiving a down alert from Pingdom, triggers a series of diagnostic or remediation actions on AWS, like checking server statuses or rebooting instances, to attempt an automatic fix before manual intervention is needed.
