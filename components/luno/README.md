# Overview

The Luno API offers a way to automate interactions with the Luno platform, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange. Through this API, you can programmatically access real-time market data, manage trades, and handle your wallet transactions. Integrating Luno with Pipedream enables you to create custom, serverless workflows that can react to Luno events, automate trading strategies, consolidate financial reports, and more. Pipedream's no-code platform allows you to seamlessly connect Luno to 3,000+ other apps and orchestrate complex workflows with minimal effort.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Crypto Trading**: Set up a workflow where market data from Luno triggers buy or sell orders based on custom logic. For instance, buy Bitcoin whenever it drops below a certain price, and sell when it rises above a set threshold.

- **Sync Transaction Data to Google Sheets**: Whenever a new transaction is made on Luno, automatically update a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This could be useful for tracking trades, managing portfolio performance, and maintaining financial records without manual data entry.

- **Send Real-Time Price Alerts via SMS**: Create a workflow that monitors the Luno exchange for price changes in your preferred cryptocurrency. Using Twilio or a similar service, send an SMS alert when the price hits predefined targets, keeping you informed for timely investment decisions.
