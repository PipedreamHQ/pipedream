# Overview

The Trakt API allows you to interact with the Trakt platform, which tracks TV shows and movies you watch, offering personalized recommendations and social features. On Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create powerful automations and integrations with your media consumption data. These could range from syncing your watch history with other services, to creating alerts based on new episode releases, or even building a custom analytics dashboard for your viewing habits. With access to user-specific data through OAuth, the possibilities for personalization are extensive.

## Example Use Cases

- **Track New Episodes**: Automatically post to a Slack channel when a new episode of your favorite show is released. This keeps you and your team updated on the latest episodes for communal watching or discussion.

- **Sync Watchlist with Calendar**: Create events in your Google Calendar for movie release dates pulled from your Trakt watchlist. Never miss a premiere you've been waiting for by having your calendar remind you.

- **Personal Viewing Stats Dashboard**: Build a personal dashboard using a tool like Google Sheets to visualize your viewing trends over time. With a scheduled Pipedream workflow, you can regularly fetch your watch history and stats from Trakt and push that data to your dashboard.
