# Overview

The Annature API provides functionality for electronic signatures, allowing documents to be signed digitally with ease and security. Integrating this API with Pipedream, users can automate document workflows, such as sending contracts for signature, tracking the status of documents, and storing signed agreements. By leveraging serverless workflows on Pipedream, these processes can be connected to 3,000+ other apps to create efficient automation solutions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Deployment**: Set up a workflow that triggers when a new customer is added to your CRM (like Salesforce). The workflow automatically sends a pre-filled contract for electronic signature via Annature, streamlining the onboarding process.

- **Document Status Tracking**: Implement a Pipedream workflow that polls the Annature API for updates on document status. When a document is fully signed, trigger an action to update your project management tool (like Asana) and notify the team through a messaging platform (like Slack).

- **Secure Document Archiving**: Create a workflow that reacts to a webhook from Annature indicating a completed signature. The workflow could then store the signed document in a secure cloud storage service (like Google Drive) and log the transaction in a database for reference.
