# Example Use Cases

- **Craftboxx Project Sync with Google Sheets**: Automate the process of syncing project details and updates from Craftboxx to a Google Sheet. Anytime a project is updated or a new project is created in Craftboxx, the workflow triggers and updates the corresponding Google Sheet.

- **Time Tracking Alerts via Slack**: Set up a workflow that monitors time tracking entries in Craftboxx. When a certain threshold of hours is logged on a project, the workflow sends an alert to a designated Slack channel. This ensures project managers are informed and can keep projects on track.

- **Invoice Generation with QuickBooks**: Create an automated workflow that generates invoices in QuickBooks whenever a project reaches completion in Craftboxx. The workflow would pull necessary details from Craftboxx and populate them in a new QuickBooks invoice, streamlining the billing process.
