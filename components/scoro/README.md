# Overview

Scoro is a comprehensive solution that combines project management, time tracking, and CRM functionalities. With the Scoro API, you can automate your business workflows, sync data across different systems, and enhance productivity by reducing manual tasks. The API allows you to access, manipulate, and integrate your Scoro data with other services. When used on Pipedream, you can create serverless workflows to connect Scoro with 3,000+ other apps, respond to Scoro events in real-time, and automate actions based on triggers from within Scoro or other platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Scoro Contacts with Google Sheets:** Automatically export new or updated contact information from Scoro to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This keeps your contact data synchronized without manual input, and since Google Sheets is also supported by Pipedream, setting up this workflow is straightforward.

- **Manage Scoro Projects with GitHub Issues:** Create a link between Scoro and GitHub where new GitHub issues trigger the creation of corresponding tasks or projects in Scoro. For teams that manage their code in GitHub, this ensures project management aspects are updated in Scoro without switching contexts.

- **Automate Invoice Creation and Email Notifications:** When a deal is won in Scoro, trigger an automation that creates an invoice and then sends an email notification through SendGrid or another email service. This reduces the manual work involved in billing and ensures prompt communication with clients.
