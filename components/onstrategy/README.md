# Overview

The OnStrategy API lets you automate strategic planning and tracking within your organization. You can create, update, and retrieve data on goals, actions, and progress, making it simpler to integrate strategic management into daily workflows. Pipedream's serverless platform eases the process by allowing you to construct workflows that link OnStrategy with other apps, trigger actions based on events, and handle data programmatically without managing servers.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Strategy Reporting**: Build a workflow that fetches strategic goal data from OnStrategy and sends a formatted report to Slack or email on a weekly basis, ensuring team members are always informed about progress and updates.

- **Strategy Progress Tracker**: Create a Pipedream workflow that listens for updates in project management tools like Asana or Trello. Whenever a relevant task is completed, it triggers an update in OnStrategy to reflect the progress made towards a strategic goal.

- **Strategic Decision Making**: Use Pipedream to set up a workflow where key performance indicators (KPIs) from various sources like Google Analytics or Salesforce are collected and sent to OnStrategy, enabling data-driven decision making based on real-time analytics.
