# Overview

The Microsoft SharePoint Online API allows users to interact with their SharePoint data and services programmatically. With this API, you can automate document and list management, streamline content delivery, and integrate SharePoint capabilities into your own applications. On Pipedream, you can harness the SharePoint Online API to create custom workflows that automate file operations, synchronize data across services, or manage site collections, leveraging Pipedream's serverless execution environment for scalable automation.

## Example Use Cases

- **Automated Document Approval Workflow**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever a new document is added to a specific SharePoint library. The workflow can automatically send an approval request to a manager using the Microsoft Outlook API. Once approved, the document can be moved to a different folder and relevant parties notified.

- **Sync SharePoint Lists with External Databases**: Use Pipedream to detect changes in a SharePoint list and sync these changes to an external database, like MySQL or PostgreSQL. This can ensure that data used by your applications remains consistent and up-to-date across platforms.

- **Daily SharePoint Site Report Generation**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that runs daily to collect information from multiple SharePoint sitesâ€”like document counts, active users, and storage usage. This data can then be compiled into a report and sent to team leads through a service like Slack for easy monitoring.
