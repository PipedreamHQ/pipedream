# Overview

The Microsoft SharePoint Online API opens up a world of possibilities for integrating your SharePoint content with other services and automating tasks. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to create powerful workflows that trigger on events in SharePoint, manipulate data, and connect with countless other apps. Create custom automations for document management, team notifications, content moderation, and more, without the need to manage infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Document Approval Workflows**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream whenever a new document is uploaded to a SharePoint library. Use the API to send approval requests via email using an app like SendGrid. Once approved, update the document's metadata in SharePoint to reflect the change.

- **Sync SharePoint Lists with External Databases**: Keep a SharePoint list in sync with an external database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. Use scheduled Pipedream workflows to fetch records from the database and update the corresponding SharePoint list items, or vice versa.

- **Aggregate SharePoint Analytics**: Collect and aggregate analytics from SharePoint, like page views or document downloads. Send this data to a service like Google Sheets or Data Studio for advanced reporting and visualization.
