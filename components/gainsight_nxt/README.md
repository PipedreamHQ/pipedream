# Overview

The Gainsight API facilitates integration with your customer success workflows, enabling the automation of processes like customer health scoring, churn prediction, and personalized customer engagement. With Pipedream, you can connect Gainsight to hundreds of other services, triggering actions based on customer data changes, or updating records in real-time based on external events. This could significantly enhance the efficiency of customer success teams by automating routine tasks and providing deeper insights into customer behaviors.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Customer Health Score Updates**: Automatically update customer health scores in Gainsight based on activity data received from other platforms like Salesforce or HubSpot. For instance, if a customer's engagement level drops in HubSpot, this could trigger a workflow in Pipedream that updates the health score in Gainsight, prompting proactive engagement from the customer success team.

- **Churn Prediction Alerts**: Use machine learning models to predict customer churn and create alerts in Gainsight. Connect customer data from Gainsight to a ML model hosted on AWS or Google Cloud via Pipedream. If the prediction model indicates a high risk of churn, automatically trigger an alert or task in Gainsight for the customer success manager to take immediate action.

- **Sync Support Ticket Insights**: Integrate Gainsight with support platforms like Zendesk or Intercom to automatically update customer records in Gainsight whenever a new support ticket is filed or resolved. This helps maintain an up-to-date view of customer issues in Gainsight, allowing customer success managers to proactively address potential dissatisfaction or product issues.
