# Overview

Extensiv Integration Manager API offers a way to streamline order, inventory, and warehouse management by connecting various eCommerce platforms, marketplaces, and shipping solutions. By leveraging this API on Pipedream, you can automate complex processes such as order fulfillment, inventory syncs, and shipping label generation, all in a serverless environment. This enables you to create dynamic, real-time workflows that respond to events such as new orders, stock level changes, or shipping status updates.

# Example Use Cases

- **Order Fulfillment Automation**: When a new order is placed in an eCommerce platform, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that utilizes the Extensiv Integration Manager API to pick, pack, and ship the order. The workflow can update inventory levels across multiple channels and send a confirmation email to the customer with tracking information by connecting with an email service like SendGrid.

- **Inventory Level Synchronization**: Maintain accurate inventory levels across all selling channels. Set up a Pipedream workflow that periodically checks inventory levels using Extensiv Integration Manager API. If it detects a discrepancy, the workflow can automatically update inventory quantities across platforms such as Shopify or Amazon, preventing overselling and keeping listings up-to-date.

- **Shipping Label Generation and Printing**: Automate the process of creating and printing shipping labels as soon as an order is ready to be shipped. Using Pipedream, create a workflow that calls the Extensiv Integration Manager API to generate the label, then sends the label to a printing service like Google Cloud Print or directly to a physical printer connected to the network.
