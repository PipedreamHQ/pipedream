Assuming you have a Spotify Developer account (https://developer.spotify.com/), you can use the Spotify API to build the following: 

- An app that displays a user's top artists, tracks, and genres
- A playlist generator that creates a playlist based on a user's favorite artists
- An app that shows a user's friends who also listen to a particular artist
- A concert finder that shows a user upcoming concerts for their favorite artists
