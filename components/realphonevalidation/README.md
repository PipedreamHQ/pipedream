# Overview

With the RealPhoneValidation API, users can verify and validate phone numbers to ensure their accuracy and activity. This is crucial for businesses that rely on phone communication to connect with customers, as it helps to reduce wasted resources on invalid numbers and improves the efficiency of outreach campaigns. By integrating this API into Pipedream, you can automate phone number validation within your workflows and seamlessly combine this process with other actions and data from a wide variety of apps to enhance lead validation, customer onboarding, and user authentication processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Verification Workflow**: Create a Pipedream workflow that triggers every time a new lead is captured in your CRM (like Salesforce). The workflow would use the RealPhoneValidation API to verify the phone number provided, updating the lead score or status based on the validation result. This ensures sales teams focus on leads with valid contact information.

- **User Signup Validation**: For platforms requiring phone verification upon user signup, a Pipedream workflow can be triggered upon the creation of a new user account. The workflow would use RealPhoneValidation to confirm the phone number's legitimacy and, if validated, send a welcome message or notification through Twilio, or alternatively, flag the account for follow-up if the number is invalid.

- **E-commerce Order Confirmation**: Automate order processing in an e-commerce store by setting up a Pipedream workflow that triggers after an order is placed. Before confirming the order, use RealPhoneValidation to ensure the phone number associated with the order is active. If active, proceed with order confirmation and fulfillment; if not, send an alert or email via SendGrid to request updated contact information from the customer.
