# Overview

The Sendcloud API offers a suite of tools for streamlining shipping processes for e-commerce businesses. Using the API, you can create and manage shipments, print shipping labels, track packages, and handle returns with ease. When integrated with Pipedream, the Sendcloud API enables you to automate your shipping workflow, connect with other apps and services, and create custom notifications and actions based on shipping events.

# Example Use Cases

- **Order Fulfillment Automation**: When a new order is received in your e-commerce platform, such as Shopify, you can use Pipedream to automatically create a shipment in Sendcloud, print the label, and update the order status back in Shopify.

- **Shipping Notifications**: Leverage Pipedream to monitor the status of shipments in Sendcloud and send real-time notifications to customers via email or SMS through SendGrid or Twilio when their package is shipped, out for delivery, or delivered.

- **Return Handling**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to detect when a return is initiated in Sendcloud. Automatically notify your customer support team in Slack or Zendesk and update inventory levels in your database or ERP system.
