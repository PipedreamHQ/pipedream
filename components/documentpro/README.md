# Overview

The DocumentPro API allows for automation and enhancement of document processing tasks such as generating, updating, and managing documents dynamically. It can be used to automate workflows that involve document parsing, data extraction, and automated document generation, streamlining processes that require handling various document formats efficiently.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Generation**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream when a new client is added to a CRM like Salesforce. Use data from the CRM to generate a customized contract through the DocumentPro API and send the generated document via email, all automated without manual intervention.
- **Invoice Processing System**: Set up a workflow where scanned invoice images uploaded to a cloud storage platform like Dropbox are automatically sent to DocumentPro API for data extraction. Extracted data can be used to update accounting software like QuickBooks, streamlining the accounts payable process.
- **Real-Time Legal Document Updates**: Create a workflow where updates to legal documents stored in Google Drive trigger notifications. Use DocumentPro API to automatically apply changes to the document based on preset rules or conditions, ensuring all documents are up-to-date with the latest compliance standards.
