# Overview

The Microsoft Outlook Calendar API provides programmatic access to a user's calendar events, allowing for the creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of events within Outlook calendars. With Pipedream, you can integrate these calendar operations into workflows that automate tasks involving scheduling, event management, and coordination with other services. Whether it's triggering actions when new events are created, syncing calendar events with other scheduling tools, or managing attendees, Pipedream's serverless platform enables you to build custom automations with minimal overhead.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Event Reminder Emails**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever a new event is added to an Outlook Calendar. The workflow could send a reminder email via a service like SendGrid or Gmail to all the attendees a day before the event occurs, ensuring everyone is prepped and on time.

- **Cross-Platform Calendar Sync**: Sync events between Microsoft Outlook Calendar and Google Calendar. When an event is created or updated in Outlook, a Pipedream workflow can create or update a corresponding event in Google Calendar. This ensures that users who operate across different platforms have unified schedules.

- **Meeting Room Availability Checker**: Monitor your Outlook Calendar for new meetings and automatically check the availability of meeting rooms using a service like Google's G Suite Admin SDK. If a room is available, the workflow reserves it and updates the event with the room's details. If not, it could notify the organizer to select a different room or time.
