# Overview

The ChatPDF API enables you to convert chat histories from various messaging platforms into PDFs. This utility can be a game-changer for archiving conversations, legal documentation, or creating backups of critical chats. With Pipedream, you can automate the conversion process and integrate it with countless apps to streamline chat management tasks. Think of pulling chat data from messaging apps, converting them to PDF, and then saving or sharing themâ€”all set up to run on autopilot.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Chat Backups**: Set up a workflow that listens for new messages in a Slack channel or WhatsApp chat, forwards them to the ChatPDF API, and saves the resulting PDF to Google Drive or Dropbox. This ensures you always have up-to-date backups of important conversations.

- **Customer Support Ticket Archiving**: Convert completed customer support chats into PDFs for archiving. After a support session on Intercom or Zendesk, a Pipedream workflow can trigger the PDF conversion and attach the file to the corresponding support ticket or email it to the customer for their records.

- **Event Conversation Compilation**: After an event, you might want to compile all the chat history from a Discord server or a Slack channel into a single PDF document. With Pipedream, you can create a workflow that triggers at a specific time, grabs the chat history, sends it to ChatPDF for conversion, and then shares the PDF with attendees via email or a shared workspace.
