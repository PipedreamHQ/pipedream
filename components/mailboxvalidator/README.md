# Overview

MailboxValidator is a precision tool for email verification that checks email lists for bad or invalid addresses. It helps maintain hygiene in your mailing list by ensuring that emails are deliverable, reducing bounce rates significantly. By integrating MailboxValidator with Pipedream, you can automate the cleanse of email lists, validate emails in real-time during sign-up processes, and improve the reliability of email marketing campaigns. Pipedream's platform provides the flexibility to trigger workflows with events, schedule tasks, and connect to numerous other services to enrich data or take actions based on the results of an email validation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time Email Verification on Sign-ups**: Integrate MailboxValidator with a sign-up form on your website. When a new user signs up, trigger a Pipedream workflow to validate the email address. If it's invalid, automatically prevent form submission or signal an error to the user.

- **Scheduled Email List Cleaning**: Set up a scheduled Pipedream workflow to periodically validate your entire email list stored in Google Sheets. Use MailboxValidator to identify invalid emails, and then programmatically remove them from the sheet, ensuring your email marketing tools are working with a clean list.

- **Customer Onboarding Email Verification**: In a customer onboarding flow, verify the customer's email address with MailboxValidator. If the email is valid, proceed with sending a welcome email using SendGrid and create a new customer record in your CRM like Salesforce, all orchestrated by a Pipedream workflow.
