# Overview

The InfoLobby API offers access to extensive databases of information, including business data, personal profiles, and other valuable datasets useful for market research, due diligence, and personal verification processes. Leveraging this API within Pipedream allows users to automate data retrieval, integrate enriched data into business workflows, and dynamically respond to data-driven events.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Lead Enrichment**: Enhance your CRM system by automatically enriching leads with detailed business information from InfoLobby. When a new lead is added in Salesforce, trigger a Pipedream workflow that uses the InfoLobby API to fetch company size, key contacts, and financials, updating the CRM record with these details.

- **Due Diligence Process Automation**: Streamline your due diligence by automating the retrieval of comprehensive background information. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers whenever a new potential partnership is recorded in a tool like Airtable. The workflow uses InfoLobby to pull all relevant corporate data, ensuring decision-makers have all the necessary information at their fingertips.

- **Real-time Risk Assessment**: Implement a real-time risk assessment tool by connecting InfoLobby with your internal systems. Whenever a new transaction or application is initiated, use a Pipedream workflow to check the involved parties against InfoLobbyâ€™s database, instantly flagging any potential risks based on preset criteria.
