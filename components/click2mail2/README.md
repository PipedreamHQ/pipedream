# Overview

The Click2Mail API enables automated mailing solutions, letting you integrate direct mail processes within your digital workflows. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to craft serverless workflows that interact with other apps and services. Create, manage, and send postal mail without leaving your digital ecosystem. Automate mail for marketing, invoicing, or any correspondence that requires a physical mail presence.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Mailing**: When a new invoice is created in your accounting software, such as QuickBooks, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends the invoice details to Click2Mail. Click2Mail then prints and mails the invoice to the customer, streamlining the billing process.

- **Postcard Marketing Campaign Trigger**: Use a CRM platform like HubSpot to trigger a Pipedream workflow when a new lead is added to a specific stage in your sales pipeline. The workflow then sends a custom postcard via Click2Mail, providing a personal touch to potential customers.

- **Customer Thank You Notes**: After an order is marked as delivered in an e-commerce platform like Shopify, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends a thank you note through Click2Mail. This gesture can enhance customer satisfaction and encourage repeat business.
