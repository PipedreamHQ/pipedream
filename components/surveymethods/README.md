# Overview

The SurveyMethods API allows users to automate the management and analysis of surveys and the corresponding data. With the Pipedream integration, you can trigger workflows based on survey events, sync survey results with other databases or apps, and manage survey distribution programmatically. This serves to streamline the survey process from distribution to data actioning, all in real-time and without the need for manual intervention.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Survey Responses Aggregation**: Capture SurveyMethods responses and aggregate them in a Google Sheet for real-time analysis. Each time a new response is received, a Pipedream workflow is triggered, appending the response data to a designated Google Sheet. This is perfect for teams needing to analyze feedback instantly without manual exports.

- **Immediate Follow-up on Survey Feedback**: Instantly reach out to respondents who provided specific feedback. Say a respondent indicates dissatisfaction; Pipedream can trigger an email through an app like SendGrid, offering support or a discount code, thus acting swiftly on user sentiment.

- **Survey Completion Tracking in CRM**: Log completed surveys as events in a CRM like Salesforce. When a respondent completes a survey, Pipedream adds a record of this completion to the respondent's contact entry on Salesforce. This helps sales and customer success teams personalize follow-up communications.
