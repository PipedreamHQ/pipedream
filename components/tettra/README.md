# Overview

The Tettra API lets you automate your knowledge management tasks within the Tettra knowledge base. Using Pipedream, you can create workflows to streamline content creation, manage pages and categories, and sync with your team's tool stack. Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform enables you to connect Tettra with hundreds of other apps to automate complex processes, share information across teams and systems, and trigger actions based on events in Tettra or other integrated services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Tettra Updates to Slack**: Automatically post Tettra page updates or new pages to a dedicated Slack channel. This keeps your team informed about the latest knowledge base changes without leaving their communication hub.

- **Tettra Content Backup**: Create a workflow that triggers at regular intervals to back up Tettra pages to a cloud storage solution like Google Drive or Dropbox. This ensures your team's knowledge is safe and version-controlled.

- **Tettra Page Creation from GitHub Issues**: When a new issue is tagged as 'documentation' on GitHub, trigger a workflow to create a new Tettra page draft. This helps in maintaining up-to-date documentation for project repos and makes it easier to track documentation tasks.
