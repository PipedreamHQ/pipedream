# Overview

Sendfox is an email marketing platform designed for content creators. With the Sendfox (OAuth) API on Pipedream, you can automate your marketing efforts by creating workflows that trigger based on specific events or conditions. This includes sending customized emails, managing contacts, and analyzing campaign performance, all programmatically. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can connect Sendfox to a myriad of other services to streamline processes, such as collecting new subscribers from various sources, syncing contact lists, or triggering campaigns from external events.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Welcome Email Sequence**: Trigger a personalized welcome email sequence in Sendfox whenever a new user subscribes through a Google Form. Use Pipedream to listen for new form submissions, extract the user's information, and add them to a specific Sendfox list that kicks off the welcome email sequence.

- **Content-Based Email Campaigns**: Create an automation that sends out an email campaign from Sendfox whenever a new blog post is published on your WordPress site. Use Pipedream to watch for new posts on WordPress, then draft and send an email to your subscribers with the post content, ensuring they never miss an update.

- **E-commerce Customer Follow-Up**: After a customer makes a purchase on Shopify, set up a Pipedream workflow that adds them to a Sendfox list and triggers a follow-up email sequence for feedback or cross-selling related products. This workflow can help boost customer engagement and drive repeat business.
