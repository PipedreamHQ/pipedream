# Overview

The Drata API hooks into Drata's compliance and security platform, empowering you to automate interactions related to monitoring, evidence collection, and reporting. By harnessing this API through Pipedream, you can streamline compliance workflows, synchronize audit evidence, and trigger real-time alerts for system changes or audit issues, leading to a more resilient and responsive compliance strategy.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Evidence Collection for Audits**: Use the Drata API to periodically gather and upload evidence of compliance controls to Drata. Connect with GitHub to automatically pull in the latest commit logs or issue tracking data, ensuring continuous audit readiness.

- **Real-time Compliance Alerts**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for changes in your infrastructure or SaaS apps, using APIs like AWS CloudTrail or Okta. When a change is detected that might affect your compliance status, an alert is sent to a designated Slack channel via the Drata API.

- **Compliance Status Dashboard**: Combine Drata with a dashboard tool like Google Sheets or a BI app to visualize your compliance status. Regularly fetch key compliance metrics from Drata through Pipedream and display them on your dashboard to keep your team informed.
