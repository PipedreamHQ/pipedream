# Overview

The Smartsheet API unlocks the power of managing and automating complex workflows, directly interacting with Smartsheet's features such as sheets, rows, columns, and attachments. You can create, read, update, and delete sheets, share them with others, and extract complex data reports. Leveraging the API on Pipedream allows for seamless integration with other services for enhanced productivity and data management. Whether you're orchestrating an approval process, syncing data across platforms, or automating project tracking, the Smartsheet API pairs with Pipedream's serverless platform to build powerful, scalable, and automated workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Project Management Automation**: Automatically create tasks in Smartsheet from GitHub issues. Each time a new issue is opened in a specified GitHub repository, a Pipedream workflow triggers to create a corresponding task in Smartsheet, ensuring project managers have instant visibility of development queues.

- **Sales Lead Tracking**: Sync new leads from a Google Form to a Smartsheet sales pipeline. When a prospective customer submits their information, a Pipedream workflow captures this data, populates a row in Smartsheet, and can even trigger an email notification to the sales team via Gmail.

- **Inventory Management**: Connect Smartsheet to Shopify for real-time inventory updates. Anytime a product's stock changes on Shopify, a Pipedream workflow updates the relevant inventory sheet in Smartsheet, keeping supply chain managers in sync with current stock levels.
