# Overview

The Google Safe Browsing API lets you check URLs against Google's constantly updated lists of unsafe web resources. These include social engineering sites (like phishing and deceptive sites) and sites that host malware or unwanted software. Within Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate the process of scanning URLs in various contexts, such as user-generated content, emails, or within applications that require high-security measures.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated URL Check in User Submissions:** Create a Pipedream workflow that automatically checks URLs submitted by users through a form or a chatbot. If the URL is flagged as unsafe, the workflow can alert a moderator or log the incident for further review.

- **Email Security Scanning:** Build a Pipedream workflow that scans links in incoming emails using the Google Safe Browsing API. Connect this with your email service to automatically quarantine or flag emails containing malicious links, enhancing your email security.

- **Link Validation in Content Publishing:** Integrate the Google Safe Browsing API in a Pipedream workflow that validates links in content before publishing on your website. This can ensure that external links in blog posts or articles do not lead to harmful sites, protecting your readers and your site's reputation.
