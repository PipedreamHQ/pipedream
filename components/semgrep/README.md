# Overview

The Semgrep API enables developers to integrate powerful static code analysis within their workflows on Pipedream. Semgrep scans codebases for bugs, security issues, and code standards, making it a vital tool for maintaining code quality. On Pipedream, you can automate code reviews, enforce coding standards, and trigger alerts or actions based on scan results. By connecting Semgrep to Pipedream, you can streamline your CI/CD pipelines, notify teams of critical issues, and even auto-fix problems under certain conditions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Code Review Notifications**: Trigger a Semgrep scan whenever code is pushed to a GitHub repository. If issues are detected, format the results and send them as a pull request comment or to a Slack channel, notifying developers of potential problems immediately.

- **Enforce Coding Standards on Merge Requests**: Before merging code into the main branch, use Semgrep to ensure it meets your organization's coding standards. If the code fails the check, block the merge request and create an issue in Jira or another project management tool for remediation.

- **Scheduled Codebase Audits with Reporting**: Schedule regular Semgrep scans of your entire codebase and collate the findings into a report. Send this report to an email list, or log it in a tool like Confluence for team review, ensuring ongoing code hygiene and security compliance.
