# Overview

The LifterLMS API allows you to leverage a powerful learning management system within your Pipedream workflows, enabling automation of course-related tasks, user management, and more. With this API, you can create new courses, enroll students, track progress, and trigger actions based on course events. Integrating LifterLMS with Pipedream can streamline operations, enhance student engagement, and provide personalized learning experiences by connecting to various other services like email platforms, CRMs, or analytics tools.

# Example Workflows

- **Automated Student Onboarding**: When a new user signs up for a course via LifterLMS, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends a personalized welcome email through SendGrid, adds the userâ€™s details to a Google Sheet for tracking, and enrolls the student in an introductory course.

- **Course Completion Certificates**: Once a student completes a course in LifterLMS, use Pipedream to generate a certificate using a PDF generation service, then email the certificate to the student and update their status in a connected CRM like HubSpot, marking them as a certified user.

- **Real-time Course Analytics**: Monitor student progress and course interactions in real-time by setting up a Pipedream workflow that captures LifterLMS events, analyzes the data using a service like Google BigQuery, and visualizes these insights using a dashboard tool like Google Data Studio for better decision-making.
