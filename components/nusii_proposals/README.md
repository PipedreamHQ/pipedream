# Overview

The Nusii Proposals API enables users to automate and integrate their proposal workflow with other tools and services. With this API, you can create, send, and manage proposals, keep track of their status, and handle clients efficiently. Leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can construct workflows that respond to events in Nusii, like a new proposal acceptance, or trigger actions in Nusii based on activities in other apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Proposal Follow-ups**: When a proposal is sent and remains unopened for a set period, trigger a follow-up email sequence or a reminder task in your CRM to ensure timely engagement.

- **Proposal Acceptance to Project Kick-off**: On proposal acceptance, automatically create a project in your project management tool, like Asana or Trello, and notify team members in Slack or Microsoft Teams to commence work.

- **Client Onboarding Workflow**: After a proposal gets accepted, trigger a client onboarding sequence, which could include adding client details to a CRM like Salesforce, scheduling a kick-off call via Calendly, and creating an invoice in QuickBooks or Xero.
