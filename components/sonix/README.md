# Overview

The Sonix API enables automated transcription of audio and video files into text, offering functions like uploading media, managing files, and retrieving transcripts. Leveraging Pipedreamâ€™s capabilities, you can integrate the Sonix API with various services to streamline media processing workflows, making transcription tasks more efficient. By automating interactions with Sonix, you can trigger actions based on the transcription status, analyze content, and connect transcribed text with other apps for further processing or analysis.

# Example Use Cases

- **Transcription Triggered from Cloud Storage Upload**: When a new audio file is uploaded to cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive), Pipedream detects the event and triggers a workflow that uploads the file to Sonix for transcription. Once the transcript is ready, it can be saved back to Google Drive or sent via email.

- **Media Management with Slack Notifications**: Use Pipedream to monitor your Sonix account for new transcripts. When a transcript is completed, send a notification with details and a download link to a designated Slack channel. This keeps the team updated on transcription progress in real-time without manual checks.

- **Content Analysis and Keyword Extraction**: After a transcript is generated, a workflow can pass the text to a natural language processing (NLP) service, like the Google Cloud Language API, to extract keywords and analyze sentiment. The results could then be sent to a Google Sheet for tracking trends over time.
