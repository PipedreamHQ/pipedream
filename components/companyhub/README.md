- **Email Campaign Trigger Based on CRM Updates**: Set up a workflow where changes in CompanyHub, such as a lead status update, automatically trigger a personalized email campaign in a marketing platform like Mailchimp. This ensures timely follow-up emails that are tailored to the lead's journey stage.
