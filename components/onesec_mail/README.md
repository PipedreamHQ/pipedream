# Overview

The 1sec Mail API lets you interact with temporary email accounts, providing functionalities like creating new emails, fetching messages, and downloading attachments. It's a handy tool for testing email-related functionalities without spamming your inbox or when privacy is a concern. Within Pipedream, you can leverage this API to build automated workflows that can handle email verification, temporary account creation for testing, and more, all without cluttering your main email account.

# Example Use Cases

- **Email Verification Automation**: Automatically create a temporary email address with 1sec Mail, use it to sign up for a service, and then use Pipedream to check the inbox for a verification email and extract the verification link.

- **Attachment Download & Processing**: Set up a Pipedream workflow where you create a 1sec Mail address, receive emails with attachments, and have Pipedream download and send the attachments to another app like Dropbox for storage or to a service like VirusTotal for scanning.

- **Privacy-focused Newsletter Signup**: Use a 1sec Mail address to sign up for newsletters or offers, then use Pipedream to route any useful content to your permanent email or to apps like Slack for easy reading, keeping your real email address private and your inbox clean.
