# Overview

MeetingPulse is a platform designed to make meetings and events interactive by enabling real-time polling, Q&A sessions, quizzes, and more. Using the MeetingPulse API, you can integrate these interactive experiences into your processes or applications. With Pipedream, the API's potential multiplies, allowing you to create seamless workflows that react to meeting events, collate feedback, and automate follow-ups. By tapping into the API via Pipedream, you get the flexibility to trigger actions on numerous apps in response to meeting activities.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Feedback Collection**: After a MeetingPulse event ends, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that collects all feedback and polls responses. It can then format this data and send it to Google Sheets for analysis, or push it to a CRM like Salesforce to track attendee engagement over time.

- **Real-Time Notifications**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for new questions or comments submitted through MeetingPulse. These can trigger instant notifications in Slack to a designated channel, enabling your team to respond in real-time to audience engagement.

- **Post-Event Follow-Up**: Use Pipedream to craft a workflow where attendees who participated in a MeetingPulse session receive personalized follow-up emails via SendGrid. The content can be customized based on their interaction, providing resources they showed interest in, or thanking them for their questions.
