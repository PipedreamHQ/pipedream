# Overview

The GoCanvas API allows for the automation of document processing tasks, enabling data extraction from PDFs with ease, thus facilitating the seamless transfer of this data to other systems or databases. This proves particularly useful for businesses aiming to digitize paper-based processes, automate data entry, or integrate with other digital tools to enhance productivity and reduce manual errors.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever a new invoice is received in GoCanvas. Extract key information such as invoice number, amount, and line item details, then sync this data to your accounting software like QuickBooks or an Excel spreadsheet in real-time for streamlined financial management.

- **Customer Onboarding Documents**: When a new customer fills out an onboarding form in GoCanvas, use Pipedream to process the form, extracting relevant data, and then add the customer details directly to your CRM tool such as Salesforce. Additionally, trigger a welcome email via SendGrid to engage the customer instantly.

- **Job Application Sorting**: Optimize your HR processes by setting up a Pipedream workflow that activates when a new job application is submitted through GoCanvas. Extract applicant details and resume content, then automatically score and sort candidates based on predefined criteria, or add them to an Airtable base for a simplified review process.
