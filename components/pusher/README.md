# Overview

The Pusher API offers real-time communication capabilities for apps, enabling instant data delivery. With Pipedream, you can harness these features to create dynamic, real-time workflows that react to events, update clients immediately, and synchronize data across users and systems. It's perfect for powering live dashboards, instant notifications, chat applications, and any scenario where you need to push updates quickly and efficiently. Pipedream's serverless platform empowers you to build and run workflows that leverage Pusher's APIs without managing any infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time Data Sync Across Services:** Integrate Pusher with a database like PostgreSQL on Pipedream. When a new record is added to the database, trigger a Pipedream workflow that publishes this update to a Pusher channel, instantly updating all connected clients.

- **E-Commerce Order Notifications:** Connect Pusher with Shopify on Pipedream. Set up a workflow that listens for new orders and pushes instant confirmations or updates to customers through a Pusher-powered frontend, enhancing the shopping experience with real-time notifications.

- **IoT Device State Monitoring:** Pair Pusher with IoT platforms such as Particle. Create a Pipedream workflow that subscribes to IoT device state changes, and use Pusher to broadcast these updates to a network of subscriber devices or dashboards, maintaining real-time device status awareness.
