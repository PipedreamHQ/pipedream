# Overview

The Google Gemini API is a cutting-edge tool from Google that enables developers to leverage AI models like Imagen and MusicLM to create and manipulate images and music based on textual descriptions. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to automate workflows that integrate AI-generated content into a variety of applications, from generating visuals for social media posts to composing background music for videos. Pipedream's serverless platform allows you to connect Google Gemini API with other apps to create complex, event-driven workflows without managing infrastructure.
