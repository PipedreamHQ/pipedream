# Overview

The faktoora API offers a suite of tools for managing invoices and financial documents within applications. By integrating this API with Pipedream, you can automate tasks related to invoice creation, retrieval, and management, streamlining your financial operations. Pipedream's serverless execution model allows the API's capabilities to be woven into custom workflows that trigger on various events, process data, and connect to countless other apps to create powerful automations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing Workflow**: When new invoices are issued via faktoora, this workflow can trigger, automatically capturing invoice data and storing it in a Google Sheets document for accounting purposes. It can also send out payment reminders to clients via email when due dates approach.

- **Expense Tracking and Analysis**: Collect and analyze expenditure data by triggering a workflow whenever invoices are marked as paid in faktoora. The workflow could then feed this information into a data visualization tool like Tableau, giving you real-time insights into your financial health.

- **Vendor Onboarding and Payment Automation**: Streamline vendor onboarding by using a workflow that, upon a new vendor signup in your system, creates a corresponding profile in faktoora. Automate subsequent invoice payments to these vendors when certain conditions are met, and log these transactions in your preferred accounting software.
