# Overview

The Dex API offers a path to streamline and automate your relationship management by allowing you to sync, update, and interact with your personal Dex CRM data programmatically. On Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create powerful automations that keep your network vibrant and your connections strong, without manual effort. By integrating Dex with other apps on Pipedream, you can tailor workflows that sync contact info, set reminders for follow-ups, or trigger personalized communications based on various criteria.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contact Syncing Workflow**: Use the Dex API to automatically sync new LinkedIn connections to your Dex account. Trigger a Pipedream workflow when someone accepts your LinkedIn connection request, and add them as a contact in Dex with their details, such as name, company, and title.

- **Follow-Up Reminder Setup**: Create a workflow that adds follow-up reminders in Dex for new contacts added from a networking event. Whenever a new contact is added to your Google Sheets spreadsheet from a conference, use that trigger to create a corresponding reminder in Dex, ensuring you never miss an opportunity to nurture a connection.

- **Personalized Email Campaigns**: Launch personalized email campaigns by integrating Dex with a mailing service like SendGrid on Pipedream. When you tag a contact in Dex for a specific interest, automatically enroll them in a tailored email sequence in SendGrid, providing valuable content that aligns with their interests.
