# Overview

The Delay API allows you to build workflows that wait a specified amount of
time before continuing. This can be useful for rate-limiting actions, or
waiting for an external event to occur.

Here are some examples of what you can build using the Delay API:

- A workflow that sends a Slack message after a specified amount of time
- A workflow that checks for new data from an external API every hour
- A workflow that backs up a file to Dropbox every day
