# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Competitor Price Monitoring**: Use ScrapeNinja to scrape pricing information from competitor websites and feed the data into a Pipedream workflow. You can then compare these prices against your own, and if certain thresholds are met, automate a notification or update pricing in your ecommerce platform using Pipedream's integration with Shopify or WooCommerce.

- **Real-time News Aggregation**: Set up ScrapeNinja to gather the latest news articles from various outlets. Process and filter this content within Pipedream to identify articles relevant to your industry. The results can be automatically posted to a Slack channel or compiled into a digest email using Pipedream's Email by Zapier app.

- **Lead Generation from Online Directories**: Configure ScrapeNinja to extract data from online business directories. Use Pipedream to enrich this data, for instance by using the Clearbit app to find additional company information. Finally, push the leads into a CRM system like Salesforce or HubSpot, all within the same Pipedream workflow.
