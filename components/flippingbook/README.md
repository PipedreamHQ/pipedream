# Overview

FlippingBook is an online tool that converts PDFs into interactive, flippable digital publications. With the FlippingBook API, users can automate the transformation of static PDF documents into engaging digital flipbooks, manage their publications, track viewer statistics, and update existing documents without manual re-uploads. Integrating this API on Pipedream allows users to streamline content delivery workflows, enhance engagement analytics processes, and synchronize publication updates across various platforms automatically.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Digital Magazine Creation**: - Automatically convert new issues of a magazine, saved as PDFs in a Google Drive folder, into flippable formats using FlippingBook. Once converted, share the new FlippingBook URL via a Mailchimp email campaign to subscribers.

- **Real-time Publication Update**: - Monitor a specific Dropbox folder for updated PDFs. When an update is detected, use FlippingBook to convert the updated PDF to a digital publication and automatically replace the older version on your website by updating the embedded link via WordPress API.

- **Engagement Analytics Reporting**: - Set up a weekly routine that collects usage and engagement statistics from FlippingBook publications, compiles them into a report using Google Sheets, and then sends this report via Slack to the marketing team for review and decision-making.
