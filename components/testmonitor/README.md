# Overview

TestMonitor API taps into the robust testing and project management platform, allowing you to automate issue tracking and test management processes. With this API, you can create, update, and retrieve issues, manage test cases and results, and integrate testing workflows with other systems. Leveraging Pipedream's serverless execution model, you can craft workflows that trigger on specific events within TestMonitor, reflect changes in real-time across other applications, or systematically analyze and report test outcomes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Bug Tracking**: When a test case in TestMonitor fails, trigger a workflow that automatically creates a bug report in an issue tracking system like Jira or GitHub Issues. This keeps developers in the loop and ensures that no test failure goes unnoticed.

- **Test Result Notifications**: Set up a workflow where team members get immediate notifications through Slack or email whenever a new test result is posted in TestMonitor. This keeps the whole team up to speed and can fast-track the fixing process.

- **Synchronized Requirement Tracking**: Whenever a new requirement is added to a project management tool like Trello or Asana, trigger a Pipedream workflow that creates a corresponding test case in TestMonitor. This ensures that testing requirements stay in sync with project development milestones.
