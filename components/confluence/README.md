# Overview

The Confluence API allows developers to interact with Confluence remotely, from
within another application. This means that you can create, update, delete, and
retrieve information from Confluence, without needing to use the Confluence
user interface.

Some examples of what you can build using the Confluence API include:

- A process manager that updates Confluence pages as processes are completed
- A tool that automatically generates meeting minutes based on information
  stored in Confluence
- A customer support system that creates and updates Confluence pages based on
  customer queries
- A project management tool that updates Confluence pages as project milestones
  are reached
