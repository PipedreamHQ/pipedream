# Overview

The Confluence API allows you to harness the collaborative power of Confluence programmatically. With it, you can automate content creation, update pages, manage spaces, and extract data for reporting or integration with other tools. Leveraging this API within Pipedream enables streamlined workflows that can react to events or schedule tasks, interacting with Confluence data and connecting to an array of other apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Management**: Trigger a workflow when a new Jira ticket is created to generate a Confluence page pre-populated with the ticket details. This page can then be linked back to the Jira ticket, ensuring that documentation is initiated from the outset of a project.

- **Team Onboarding**: Onboard new team members by creating a personalized Confluence space with essential reading and tasks when a new user is added to your HR system, like BambooHR. You could also set up reminders to check in on their progress by sending follow-up emails after a set period.

- **Meeting Minute Distribution**: After a meeting is concluded in a tool like Zoom, automatically create a Confluence page using the meeting notes and distribute it to attendees via Slack or email, ensuring everyone has access to the discussed points and action items.
