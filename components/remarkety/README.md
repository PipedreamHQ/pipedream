# Overview

The Remarkety API lets you automate your email marketing campaigns by leveraging customer data. With it, you can build workflows that trigger personalized emails based on shopping behavior and customer profiles. Remarkety's API on Pipedream is a powerhouse for creating dynamic, data-driven marketing strategies by connecting various apps to orchestrate complex workflows, such as syncing customer data, segmenting audiences, or triggering targeted campaigns.

# Example Use Cases

- **Cart Abandonment Email Trigger**: When a customer leaves items in their cart without completing a purchase, you can use the Remarkety API to trigger a targeted cart abandonment email. Combine this with scheduled checks of shopping cart statuses and use Pipedream's cron job feature to send reminders at optimal times.

- **Customer Segmentation and Targeted Campaigns**: Segment customers based on their purchase history and preferences. Use the Remarkety API to tag customers in your database and create targeted email campaigns. Integrate with Shopify to sync customer purchases and create segments based on recent activity or total spend.

- **Engagement Metrics to Google Sheets**: Use Remarkety to track customer engagement with your emails, such as opens and clicks. Then, send this data to a Google Sheet using Pipedream's Google Sheets app. This allows for easy monitoring of campaign performance and can inform future marketing strategies.
