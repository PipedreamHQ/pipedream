# Overview

The Facebook Conversions API allows you to send web and offline events from your server directly to Facebook's systems, helping to enhance ad targeting, decrease reliance on cookies, and measure customer actions in ways that respect their privacy. With Pipedream, you can integrate this API into serverless workflows to automate data tracking and improve ad performance. You can, for example, track when a user completes a purchase, signs up for a newsletter, or takes another valuable action and relay this data to Facebook in real time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync E-commerce Transactions**: Automate the sending of server-side e-commerce transaction events (like purchases or cart additions) to Facebook Conversions API every time a new order is processed in your online store. Connect Pipedream to an e-commerce platform like Shopify to trigger this workflow.

- **Lead Tracking for CRM**: Whenever a new lead is captured in your CRM system, such as Salesforce, push that event to Facebook Conversions API. This allows you to optimize your Facebook ad campaigns based on lead generation data and enhance retargeting strategies.

- **Custom Event Triggering from Webhooks**: Configure a webhook to listen for specific user actions on your website or app. When the designated event occurs, such as a form submission or a milestone achievement, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends this event information to Facebook Conversions API for improved ad targeting.
