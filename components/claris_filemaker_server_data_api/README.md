# Overview

The Claris FileMaker Server Data API allows you to interact with FileMaker databases hosted on FileMaker Server or FileMaker Cloud for AWS, enabling you to manage your database records, run scripts, and perform queries through standard API calls. This API integration on Pipedream can automate workflows between your FileMaker databases and other platforms, streamlining data processes like syncing contacts, updating inventories, and generating reports without manual data entry.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contact Sync Between FileMaker and a CRM**: Automatically sync new contacts added to a FileMaker database to a CRM platform like Salesforce or HubSpot. Whenever a new contact is created in FileMaker, the workflow can capture this event, extract the contact details, and use them to create or update a contact in the CRM, ensuring your sales team has the latest information.

- **Inventory Management Automation**: Keep your inventory management systems in sync with your FileMaker database. Set up a workflow that triggers every time inventory levels change in the FileMaker database. This change can update an external inventory management system like Shopify or WooCommerce, ensuring that your online consumer-facing platforms always display the correct stock levels.

- **Scheduled Report Generation and Emailing**: Automate the generation of daily, weekly, or monthly sales reports from data stored in FileMaker and email them to specified stakeholders using an email service like SendGrid or Gmail. The workflow can be scheduled to run at specific times, extract the required data from FileMaker, generate a report, and then send it via email, reducing the manual effort required in report preparation and distribution.
