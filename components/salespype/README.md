# Overview

The Salespype API provides a suite of tools to automate and integrate your CRM workflows. With Pipedream, you can harness this power to connect Salespype with a vast array of other services, creating customized workflows without needing to manage server infrastructure. Whether you're looking to sync contacts, manage deals, automate follow-ups, or trigger custom actions based on CRM events, Pipedream makes it straightforward.

# Example Workflows

- **Sync Salespype Contacts with Google Sheets**: Automate the synchronization of new contacts from Salespype into a Google Sheet. Each time a new contact is added in Salespype, it triggers a Pipedream workflow that appends the contact's details to a specified Google Sheet. This can be used for backup, reporting, or further data analysis.

- **Create Tasks in Asana from Salespype Deals**: Whenever a new deal reaches a specific stage in Salespype, trigger a Pipedream workflow that creates a corresponding task in Asana. This helps in task management and ensures that the team focuses on the right deals at the right time without manual entry.

- **Send Custom Email Alerts for Stalled Deals**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that monitors deal progress in Salespype. If a deal hasn't moved stages within a set timeframe, trigger an email alert to the assigned salesperson or team via an email service like SendGrid. This can prompt timely follow-ups and keep deals moving forward.
