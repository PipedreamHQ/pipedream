The Wire2Air API provides the ability to integrate SMS capabilities into your applications, allowing for sending and receiving text messages, managing contacts, and automating communication processes. On Pipedream, you can leverage these features to create powerful serverless workflows, connecting the Wire2Air API with a multitude of other services for various use cases, such as notifications, marketing, and customer support.
