# Overview

The Tavily API allows users to access and manage their travel data efficiently. It provides endpoints for retrieving detailed information about destinations, accommodations, travel itineraries, and user profiles. With Tavily API on Pipedream, you can automate travel-related tasks, sync data across various travel and business applications, and build custom notifications or alerts based on travel data changes.

# Example Use Cases

Use this trigger to automatically update connected applications such as Google Calendar, sending real-time updates to travelers via SMS or email through Twilio or SendGrid.

- **Sync Accommodation Reviews to CRM:** Develop a workflow where new accommodation reviews on Tavily trigger a capture of that data, which is then pushed to a CRM platform like Salesforce or HubSpot. This can help travel agencies keep track of customer satisfaction and service quality in real-time.

Use this data to push notifications to Slack or Microsoft Teams, informing both travel agents and clients about important updates that could impact their travel plans.
