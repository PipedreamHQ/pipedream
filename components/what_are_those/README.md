# Overview

The What Are Those API provides a unique capability to identify shoes from images. It enables users to input an image of footwear and receive details about the model, brand, and other relevant data. This presents a fantastic opportunity for developers to create applications that can automatically catalogue footwear, assist in retail environments to enhance customer shopping experiences, or even help in lost-and-found services by identifying shoes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Shoe Identification for E-commerce Integrations**: Automatically identify shoes in user-uploaded images on an e-commerce platform. When a user uploads a picture of a sneaker, the What Are Those API can identify the model and brand, and Pipedream can trigger the e-commerce system (like Shopify) to show similar available products, enhancing user engagement and potential sales.

- **Inventory Management for Retailers**: Use the API to streamline inventory checks and organization. Retail employees or automated systems can snap pictures of footwear on shelves, and the API can identify the models and update inventory counts in a management system like Square or Lightspeed via Pipedream. This can reduce human error and save time in managing stock levels.

- **Lost and Found Automation Service**: Build a service where users can upload images of found shoes, and the API will identify them, automatically updating a centralized lost-and-found database system. This can be integrated with a messaging platform like Slack or email services to alert users when a match is found, potentially reuniting them with their lost items efficiently.
