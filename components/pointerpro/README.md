# Overview

The Pointerpro API enables automated interactions with Pointerpro's survey platform, allowing developers to create, manage, and analyze surveys without manual intervention. This can streamline feedback collection and data analysis, making it easier to integrate customer insights into business processes. With Pipedream, you can leverage the Pointerpro API to build custom workflows that trigger actions in other apps, based on survey responses or other events, making your data work for you in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Survey Response to CRM Update**: When a survey is completed, Pipedream can capture the response and update a contact or lead record in a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot with the new data. This keeps customer profiles up-to-date with their latest feedback and preferences.

- **Net Promoter Score (NPS) Alerting**: Create a workflow where Pipedream listens for new NPS survey submissions. If a score falls below a certain threshold, trigger an alert in Slack or send an email to the customer success team, prompting immediate follow-up with the dissatisfied customer.

- **Automated Survey Result Analysis**: Use Pipedream to send completed survey responses to a data analysis tool like Google Sheets or Tableau. Apply formulas or visualizations to identify trends and insights, which can then be shared with stakeholders through automated reports.
