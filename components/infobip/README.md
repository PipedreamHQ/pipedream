# Overview

The Infobip API is a communication platform that enables seamless integration of messaging, voice, and email functionalities into various applications. With Infobip, you can automate notifications, authenticate users via one-time passwords, engage customers across multiple channels, and track communication performance. Pipedream's serverless execution environment lets you create sophisticated workflows that harness the capabilities of Infobip by triggering actions based on events, manipulating data, and connecting with numerous other apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Automation**: When a new ticket is created in Zendesk, use Infobip to send an SMS confirmation to the customer. Automatically escalate unresolved issues by triggering a voice call after a set period, enhancing customer experience and response times.

- **Multi-channel Marketing Campaigns**: Trigger an Infobip workflow from a Shopify order event. Send personalized SMS messages for order confirmations, then follow up with email campaigns for related products, feedback requests, or loyalty program invites, all orchestrated within Pipedream.

- **Two-factor Authentication (2FA)**: Implement 2FA by integrating Infobip with a custom authentication system. Generate and send one-time passwords via SMS when a user attempts to log in, and verify the tokens within Pipedream workflows to enhance security across your application.
