# Overview

The SolarWinds Service Desk API provides a way to automate and integrate your IT service management processes. Using this API in Pipedream, you can create, update, and track service requests, manage incidents, problems, and changes, access asset information, and leverage user data within your workflows. It's about connecting your service desk with other apps to streamline processes, reduce response times, and enhance service delivery.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Incident Reporting**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that monitors for specific system alerts or error logs from your infrastructure (possibly using a tool like Datadog). When an issue is detected, automatically create an incident in SolarWinds Service Desk, assigning the right team and priority based on the alert details.

- **SLA Monitoring**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that checks ongoing incidents in SolarWinds Service Desk periodically and evaluates their response times against SLAs. If an incident is at risk of breaching its SLA, the workflow could notify a manager via email or Slack to take immediate action.

- **Asset Management Update**: Whenever a new asset is registered in your inventory system, use a Pipedream workflow to add or update the asset details in SolarWinds Service Desk. This ensures your IT asset information is always in sync and up-to-date for efficient service management.
