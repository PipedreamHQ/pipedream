# Overview

Keycloak, an open-source identity and access management solution, allows enterprises to secure applications and services with minimal effort. On Pipedream, the Keycloak API can be leveraged to automate user management processes, synchronize user information, and enhance security protocols across apps. Using Pipedream's capabilities, developers can create workflows that respond to events in Keycloak, manage user sessions, or update user roles across systems, ensuring that identity management is both seamless and secure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated User Onboarding**: When a new employee is added to an HR system like BambooHR, automatically create a user in Keycloak, assign appropriate roles, and send the account details to the employee via Slack. This workflow ensures that new employees have immediate and secure access to necessary systems.

- **Sync User Roles Between Systems**: If a user's role changes in an external system like Salesforce, detect this change and automatically update their corresponding role in Keycloak. This can help maintain role consistency across different platforms, reducing administrative overhead and security risks.

- **Scheduled User Account Review**: Set up a scheduled workflow in Pipedream to periodically fetch all user accounts from Keycloak, review their access levels, and flag accounts that no longer comply with security policies or that appear to be inactive. This can be integrated with Jira to automatically create tickets for IT to investigate or adjust these accounts.
