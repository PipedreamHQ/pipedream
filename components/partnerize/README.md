# Overview

The Partnerize API enables you to interact programmatically with the Partnerize platform, which specializes in partner marketing and affiliate management. With this API, you can automate tasks related to tracking, commissioning, and reporting on marketing campaigns. In Pipedream, you can leverage these capabilities to create automated workflows that respond to various triggers (like webhooks), manipulate data, and integrate with a myriad of other services without having to manage servers or complex infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Affiliate Signup Notifications**: Send a Slack notification or an email via SendGrid whenever a new affiliate signs up through Partnerize. This can help you stay on top of your growing affiliate network and respond promptly to new partners.

- **Campaign Performance Dashboarding**: Use Partnerize API to fetch the latest performance metrics for your marketing campaigns and feed them into a Grafana dashboard. This allows for real-time visualization and monitoring of campaign effectiveness.
