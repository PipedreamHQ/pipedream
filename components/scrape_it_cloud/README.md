# Overview

The Scrape-It.Cloud API allows you to automate the extraction of data from websites. It can parse, scrape, and retrieve content without the need for manual intervention. With this API on Pipedream, you can build workflows that trigger on various events and use the scraped data for numerous applications like data analysis, lead generation, and content aggregation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Change Detection**: Monitor changes on a webpage and receive notifications. When Scrape-It.Cloud detects a change, it can trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends an alert via email, Slack, or another messaging app.

- **Competitor Price Monitoring**: Use Scrape-It.Cloud to track competitor pricing. Pipedream can schedule the scrape and integrate with a database like Google Sheets or Airtable to log price changes over time, enabling market analysis and strategic responses.

- **Aggregating News for Curated Digests**: Scrape news sites or blogs for the latest articles. Pipedream workflows can combine this data with an app like SendGrid to distribute a curated newsletter to subscribers with the most recent updates in their industry.
