# Overview

Enedis Data-Connect API provides access to energy consumption data, enabling users to analyze and optimize electricity usage. By integrating with this API on Pipedream, you can automate the collection of meter readings, track energy consumption patterns, and even develop personalized energy-saving strategies. Pipedream's serverless platform simplifies connecting Enedis Data-Connect with other apps, allowing you to set up complex workflows without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Energy Monitoring Dashboard**: Craft a workflow that periodically fetches energy consumption data from Enedis Data-Connect and pushes it to a Google Sheet. Use the sheet to power a live dashboard for real-time monitoring, leveraging Google Data Studio for visual analytics.

- **Smart Home Integration**: Combine Enedis Data-Connect with smart home platforms like Philips Hue or Nest. Automate the dimming of lights or temperature adjustments based on real-time energy usage data, making your home more energy-efficient.

- **Billing and Alerts System**: Implement a system that correlates energy consumption with billing cycles. Use the API to fetch usage data, calculate projected costs, and send alerts via email or SMS if projected consumption exceeds a set threshold, using SendGrid or Twilio on Pipedream.
