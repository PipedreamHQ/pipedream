# Overview

The CurrencyScoop API offers real-time and historical exchange rate data, as well as currency conversion and time-series data. By integrating with Pipedream, users can create automated workflows that react to currency fluctuations, update pricing in their apps, or generate financial reports. Pipedream's serverless architecture enables running these workflows on a schedule or in response to certain triggers without managing any infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Currency Alert System**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that monitors specific currency pairs and sends alerts via email or Slack when exchange rates hit certain thresholds. This can help businesses and individuals make timely financial decisions.

- **Dynamic Pricing Model**: Implement a workflow that adjusts the prices of products or services in an eCommerce platform by pulling the latest exchange rates from CurrencyScoop. This can ensure international prices remain competitive and accurate.

- **Financial Reporting Automation**: Create a workflow that periodically retrieves historical exchange rates to analyze currency performance over time. The data can be formatted into reports and automatically sent to stakeholders or saved to Google Sheets for further analysis.
