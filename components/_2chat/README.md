# Overview

The 2Chat API allows developers to build and manage chatbots that can engage users in personalized conversations across various platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, and more. This API facilitates the creation, training, and integration of chatbots with existing applications, enabling automated responses based on user inputs and behaviors. Utilizing Pipedream's capabilities, developers can orchestrate complex workflows that react to events from 2Chat, process data, and trigger actions in other apps, streamlining communication processes and enhancing user interaction.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Automation**: Automate initial customer interactions on your business's WhatsApp number using a 2Chat-powered chatbot. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers whenever a new message is received. The workflow could analyze the message, use AI to understand the query, and either provide an instant reply or escalate complex issues to a human agent. Connect this system to a CRM like Salesforce to log interactions automatically.

- **Feedback Collection**: Use a 2Chat bot to solicit feedback after customer interactions or events. Configure a Pipedream workflow that triggers at the end of a chat session or after a purchase. The workflow can prompt the chatbot to ask for feedback, parse the responses, and save them to a Google Sheets document for analysis and future action.

- **Event Reminder and Follow-Up**: Integrate 2Chat with a calendar app like Google Calendar via Pipedream to manage event reminders and follow-ups. Set up a workflow where the chatbot sends reminders to participants before the event and collects RSVPs or answers inquiries about the event details. After the event, the chatbot can reach out for feedback or provide additional resources related to the event topics.
