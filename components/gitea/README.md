# Overview

Gitea is an open-source, self-hosted Git service, similar to GitHub. With the Gitea API, you can automate and enhance your software development practices by creating workflows that trigger actions within Gitea or across other connected services. You can manage repositories, automate issue tracking, synchronize with task management systems, and orchestrate continuous integration and deployment processes. Pipedream serves as an integration platform to connect Gitea with hundreds of other apps, allowing for complex automations that can reduce manual effort and improve efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Repository Management Automation**: Automate the creation, deletion, and updating of Gitea repositories. When a new project is started in your project management tool, such as Trello, Pipedream can listen for this event and create a corresponding repository in Gitea, set up default issue labels, and even invite team members.

- **Issue Synchronization Workflow**: Sync Gitea issues with an external tracking system like Jira. Whenever an issue is reported in Gitea, Pipedream can create a corresponding issue in Jira and keep statuses and comments in sync between the two platforms, ensuring that all team members have visibility into project issues, regardless of the system they prefer.

- **CI/CD Pipeline Trigger**: Trigger a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline in a tool like Jenkins whenever code is pushed to a specific branch in Gitea. Using Pipedream to listen for push events, you can automatically initiate build and test sequences, and if successful, deploy the latest code to staging or production environments.
