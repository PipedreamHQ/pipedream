# Overview

FlexiSign API allows for advanced document signing and management functionalities. Imagine automating document workflows, tracking status updates, and integrating digital signatures directly into your business processes. With Pipedream, you can leverage these capabilities to automate repetitive tasks, sync data across multiple platforms, and enhance efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Workflow**: Create a workflow in Pipedream that triggers when a new contract is uploaded to your cloud storage (like Google Drive). The FlexiSign API can automatically send these contracts for signing, and upon completion, store the signed version back in Google Drive and update your CRM.

- **Onboarding Automation**: For new employee onboarding, use Pipedream to automatically send employment documents via FlexiSign when a new employee record is added to your HR system (like BambooHR). Once signed, the documents are saved in a secure HR folder, and relevant teams are notified via Slack.

- **Customer Onboarding and Documentation**: Automate the sending of customer onboarding documents when a new client is added to your sales CRM, like Salesforce. With Pipedream, send these documents through FlexiSign for signature, and upon completion, update the client's record in Salesforce and send a personalized email confirmation via SendGrid.
