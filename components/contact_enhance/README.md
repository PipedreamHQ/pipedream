# Overview

The Contact Enhance API allows you to enrich contact data by providing detailed information on individuals or companies based on email, domain, or other identifying data. With this API integrated into Pipedream, it's possible to automate enriching contact lists, validate and score leads for marketing, and augment customer profiles for better personalization. Pipedream's serverless platform enables these tasks to be set up with minimal coding, leveraging a vast array of triggers and actions from various apps to create powerful workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Qualification Automation**: Trigger a workflow with a new lead submission from a form or CRM like Salesforce. Pass the lead's email to Contact Enhance API to retrieve detailed information, then use conditional logic in Pipedream to score the lead and add it to the appropriate pipeline or nurturing sequence in the CRM.

- **Enriched Contact Segmentation**: When a new email is added to a mailing list in an email marketing platform like Mailchimp, use Contact Enhance API to get additional details about the contact. Based on the enriched data, create segments in Mailchimp for targeted campaigns, improving engagement and conversion rates.

- **Customer Data Platform Enhancement**: On a regular schedule, pull records from a Customer Data Platform (CDP) like Segment. Use Contact Enhance API to update each record with additional data. The enriched profiles can then be synchronized back to the CDP or used to tailor customer experiences across various touchpoints.
