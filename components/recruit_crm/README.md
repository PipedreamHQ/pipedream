# Overview

The Recruit CRM API provides a suite of functions to automate and streamline recruitment processes. It allows you to integrate your recruitment workflow with other services, create custom applications, or even build bots. With Pipedream, you can connect the Recruit CRM API to a vast array of other apps and services to automate actions like updating candidate records, syncing with HR systems, or triggering notifications based on recruitment activities.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Candidate Sourcing**  
  Whenever a new job opening is created in Recruit CRM, use Pipedream to automatically post the job details to multiple job boards or social media platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed or Glassdoor.

- **Sync Candidate Progress with Google Sheets**  
  Monitor candidate progress through the recruitment pipeline by connecting Recruit CRM to Google Sheets. Each time a candidate moves to a new stage, Pipedream can automatically update a Google Sheet, keeping your team in sync.

- **Candidate Feedback Collection and Analysis**  
  After an interview, trigger a feedback form to the interviewer using Google Forms or Typeform. Once the feedback is submitted, Pipedream can parse the responses and update the candidate's record in Recruit CRM, or send a digest to the hiring team.
