# Overview

The ActiveCalculator API allows developers to integrate complex mathematical and financial calculation capabilities into their applications. This API can handle everything from simple arithmetic to more complex financial calculations, such as loan amortizations or investment growth projections. By connecting the ActiveCalculator API with Pipedream, users can automate these calculations based on triggers from various sources, streamlining processes that require dynamic data inputs to generate real-time results.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Expense Tracking and Budgeting**: Connect the ActiveCalculator API to a Google Sheets or Airtable base on Pipedream. Whenever a new expense is added to the sheet or table, trigger a Pipedream workflow that calculates current spending against budget limits, updating the sheet or sending a notification if the budget threshold is exceeded.

- **Dynamic Pricing Model Adjustments**: Integrate ActiveCalculator with a sales platform like Shopify using Pipedream. Set up a workflow where product prices are automatically adjusted based on a complex set of variables, such as changes in supply costs or demand fluctuations, calculated through ActiveCalculator. This can help maintain profit margins or competitive pricing automatically.

- **Investment Portfolio Rebalancing**: Use ActiveCalculator with a finance management tool like QuickBooks on Pipedream. Create a workflow that triggers monthly or quarterly to calculate the necessary adjustments needed to maintain a desired asset allocation in an investment portfolio, based on recent performance data fetched from market APIs or financial databases.
