# Overview

The ActiveCalculator API allows users to perform complex mathematical computations and retrieve financial calculation results programmatically. Integrated within Pipedream, this API powers workflows that automate numeric operations and financial analyses, enabling real-time decision-making and data-driven actions in various business applications.

# Example Use Cases

- **Mortgage Payment Automation**: Automatically calculate monthly mortgage payments for a real estate website's users. When a user inputs loan details on the website, a Pipedream workflow triggers the ActiveCalculator API to compute the payment, and subsequently stores the result in a Google Sheets spreadsheet for record-keeping and further analysis.

- **Investment Return Analysis**: For financial advisors, set up a workflow that calculates potential investment returns based on various scenarios submitted by clients through a form. Use the ActiveCalculator API to compute compound interest and project future values, then output the data directly to a client's Slack channel or email for immediate review.

- **Budget Forecasting for Event Planners**: Event planners can benefit from a workflow where anticipated expenses are automatically calculated and adjusted in real-time. As expenses are entered into an Airtable base, Pipedream triggers the ActiveCalculator API to update total costs and compare them against the budget, notifying the planner via SMS if the budget threshold is exceeded.
