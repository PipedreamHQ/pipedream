# Overview

The DataTrails API, formerly known as RKVST, is designed to track the provenance and integrity of digital assets across their lifecycle. With this API, you can create an immutable record of actions, decisions, and processes that affect any asset, thereby providing an auditable trail. Leveraging Pipedream, you can automate workflows that require secure, verifiable, and traceable asset history. You can react to events in real-time, integrate with other services, and trigger actions based on asset changes or compliance checks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Compliance Reporting**: Create a workflow that triggers whenever a new compliance report is generated in DataTrails. The report can be sent automatically to relevant stakeholders via email (using the Pipedream Email by Zapier app) and saved to cloud storage solutions like Dropbox for easy access and archiving.

- **Asset Change Notifications**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for asset status changes in DataTrails. When a change occurs, send a notification through Slack or Microsoft Teams to inform the team promptly, ensuring that everyone is aware of the latest asset state and can act accordingly.

- **Continuous Integrity Verification**: Develop a workflow where Pipedream periodically checks the integrity of an asset using DataTrails API. If any discrepancies are found, the workflow can create an incident ticket in a system like Jira or ServiceNow, initiating a review process to investigate and remediate any issues.
