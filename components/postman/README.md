# Overview

The Postman API enables you to automate tasks within your Postman collections, such as running collections, fetching and updating environments, and integrating your API development workflow into your CI/CD pipeline. Using Pipedream, you can harness this functionality to create custom workflows that trigger on various events, process data, and connect with other apps, extending the capabilities of your API testing and development processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Scheduled Collection Runs**: Use Pipedream to schedule and run Postman collections at regular intervals. You can analyze the results, send alerts if a test fails, or even trigger other workflows based on those results.

- **Dynamic Environment Updates**: Automatically update Postman environment variables when changes occur in your apps. For instance, sync new user data from a CRM platform to Postman's environment, ensuring your API tests always use the latest data.

- **CI/CD Integration**: Connect your Postman tests with your CI/CD pipeline. After every code commit, use Pipedream to trigger a workflow that runs a specific Postman collection and reports the status back to your CI/CD tool, such as GitHub Actions, ensuring that only tested code gets deployed.
