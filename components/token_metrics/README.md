# Overview

The Token Metrics API offers access to a trove of cryptocurrency data, including analytics, rankings, and predictions that leverage artificial intelligence and expert insights. With this API, you can automate investment strategies, integrate up-to-date crypto data into your applications, and stay informed with the latest market trends. When used on Pipedream, it allows you to build robust, serverless workflows that can react to various triggers and integrate with numerous services for a seamless data handling experience.

# Example Use Cases

- **Crypto Alert System**: Build a workflow on Pipedream that monitors the Token Metrics API for significant changes in crypto ratings or predictions. When certain thresholds are met, use the integrated Twilio app to send SMS alerts, ensuring you or your audience stay up-to-date on important market movements.

- **Investment Tracker**: Create a Pipedream workflow that pulls daily investment insights and portfolio analytics from the Token Metrics API and logs them to a Google Sheets document. This allows for easy tracking and historical data analysis, helping to refine investment strategies over time.

- **Market Dashboard Sync**: Use Pipedream to set up a workflow where market data and analytics from the Token Metrics API are fetched periodically and pushed to a real-time dashboard built with Geckoboard. This keeps your team or clients informed with the latest crypto market trends and forecasts.
