# Overview

Device Magic is a mobile forms and data collection tool that allows field teams to capture and submit form data using smartphones and tablets. With the Device Magic API on Pipedream, you can automate the ingestion, processing, and distribution of this data. Harnessing Pipedream's capabilities, you can trigger workflows upon form submission, manipulate the data, and integrate it with countless other services, all in real-time. This enables seamless data flow from field to office, triggering notifications, analytics, and even actions in other business applications.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Processing and Storage**: Once a form is submitted via Device Magic, trigger a Pipedream workflow to parse the data, apply any necessary transformations, and store it in a cloud database like AWS DynamoDB. This can be instrumental for maintaining up-to-date records and ensuring data quality.

- **Dynamic Reporting and Notification**: Use Pipedream to create a workflow where new Device Magic submissions trigger a report generation. The workflow could format the data into a report within Google Sheets, and then send a notification with a summary or link to the report via email through apps like SendGrid or direct messaging platforms like Slack.

- **Streamlined Task Assignment**: On submission of a Device Magic form, trigger a Pipedream workflow to analyze the data and create tasks in a project management tool such as Trello or Asana. For instance, a maintenance request form could result in the automatic creation of a new card in Trello, assigned to the appropriate team with all the relevant details included.
