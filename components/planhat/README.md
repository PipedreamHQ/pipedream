# Overview

Planhat is a customer platform designed to drive customer success and growth. The Planhat API allows you to automate and streamline customer success operations by interacting with customer data programmatically. With the Planhat API on Pipedream, you can automate workflows that sync data between apps, trigger communications based on customer interactions, and gather insights from various touchpoints to enhance customer experiences.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Onboarding Automation**: Automate the customer onboarding process by using the Planhat API to create new customer profiles and subscriptions as soon as they sign up via your platform. Connect this with Slack on Pipedream to send notifications to the customer success team to initiate personalized onboarding sequences.

- **Renewal Management**: Set up a workflow where Planhat monitors subscription end dates and triggers renewal reminders to customers via email through SendGrid. Use conditional logic to personalize messages based on customer usage data and past interaction history, ensuring high engagement and renewal rates.

- **Feedback Collection and Analysis**: After a customer interaction or product usage milestone, trigger a feedback survey using Typeform or Google Forms. Collect responses and sync them back to Planhat to update the customer profile. Use this data to drive machine learning models on Pipedream for sentiment analysis and to tailor future interactions, enhancing customer satisfaction and product development.
