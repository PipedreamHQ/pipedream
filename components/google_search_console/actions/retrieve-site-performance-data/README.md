# Google Search Console â€“ Site Performance (Analytics) Action

This action queries **search performance data** for a verified website using the [Google Search Console API](https://developers.google.com/webmaster-tools/search-console-api-original/v3/searchanalytics/query). It allows you to extract insights like:

- Top search queries  
- Click-through rates  
- Page impressions  
- Device types, countries, and more  

---

## Use Cases

- Automate SEO reporting  
- Analyze organic search trends  
- Filter and break down traffic by dimensions (e.g. query, device, country)  

---

## Internals

- Supports all relevant props from the [Search Analytics Query API](https://developers.google.com/webmaster-tools/search-console-api-original/v3/searchanalytics/query)  
- Trims and validates all input props  
- Accepts optional `dimensionFilterGroups` either as an object or JSON string  
- Automatically builds the POST request body using `propsMeta` metadata  
- Returns the raw Search Console API response for full access to metrics  
- Accumulates and displays warnings for non-blocking input issues
