# Overview

The PlanSo Forms API allows for the automation of form-related tasks and the seamless integration of form data into various applications or workflows. On Pipedream, this translates to crafting serverless workflows that trigger upon form submissions, manipulating and routing the data to other services for analysis, storage, or further action. With this API, you can trigger events, process form inputs, and integrate with countless other apps in the Pipedream ecosystem to streamline processes and enhance data management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Auto-Respond to Form Submissions**: When a new form submission is detected by PlanSo Forms, use Pipedream to send an automated email response to the submitter. Integrate with email services like SendGrid or Gmail to personalize and deliver the message promptly.

- **Sync Form Data with a CRM**: Integrate PlanSo Forms with a CRM service like Salesforce or HubSpot. When a form is submitted, Pipedream can parse the data and create or update contact records in the CRM, ensuring your sales or customer service teams have the latest information.

- **Analyze and Visualize Form Data**: On form submission, collect the data and feed it into a Google Sheets spreadsheet. Use this as a basis for creating dashboards or reports in data visualization tools like Google Data Studio, helping you gain insights into your form data trends over time.
