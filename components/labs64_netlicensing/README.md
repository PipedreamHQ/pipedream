# Overview

The Labs64 NetLicensing API is a sophisticated software licensing service that enables you to manage product licenses and configurations seamlessly. Using Pipedream, you can tap into this power to automate license creation, validation, and tracking. This enables you to integrate licensing operations into your sales, deployment, and customer support workflows, ensuring consistent and automated management of software licenses across customer lifecycles.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated License Provisioning**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream that automatically generates and assigns licenses to new customers when a sale is made through Stripe. The workflow captures the Stripe payment event, creates a new license in NetLicensing, and sends the license details to the customer via Email by SendGrid.

- **License Validation for Access Control**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for user login attempts in your application (via a webhook). The workflow checks the user's license validity through NetLicensing API and, based on the result, either grants access or triggers an alert to your Slack channel for a follow-up.

- **Customer Support Automation**: Integrate a Pipedream workflow with Zendesk that automatically checks customer's license status when they submit a support ticket. If a license issue is detected, the workflow updates the ticket and informs support staff, or it can automatically generate a response to guide the customer through troubleshooting or renewal steps.
