# Overview

The Mamo Business API offers capabilities for organizations to manage payments and financial tasks. With the API, you can create and oversee invoices, process payments, and handle transfers among other operations. Integrating Mamo Business with Pipedream allows you to automate workflows involving payment processing, financial monitoring, and syncing transaction data with other business systems. Use it to streamline how money moves into and out of your organization, ensuring accurate financial records while saving time on manual tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing**: Build a workflow where you automatically create invoices in Mamo Business whenever a new order is placed in an e-commerce platform like Shopify. Once the invoice is paid, trigger an update in your inventory management system.

- **Payment Notifications**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to listen for new payments on Mamo Business. When a payment is received, you can automate the sending of a custom thank-you email to the customer via SendGrid and log the payment details in a Google Sheet for accounting purposes.

- **Financial Monitoring Dashboard**: Create a dashboard on Pipedream that pulls in transaction data from Mamo Business at regular intervals. Combine this data with other financial metrics from apps like QuickBooks or Xero for a comprehensive financial overview, which could be used to trigger alerts if certain thresholds or anomalies are detected.
