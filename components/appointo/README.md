# Overview

The Appointo API allows developers to integrate robust appointment scheduling capabilities into their applications. Appointo offers features such as managing bookings, availability settings, and automatic reminders. By leveraging this API on Pipedream, users can automate workflows that connect Appointo with other applications, synchronizing calendars, triggering notifications, or even handling cancellations and rescheduling programmatically to enhance overall efficiency and user experience.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Appointment Confirmation Emails**: Automatically send customized confirmation emails via SendGrid or Gmail when a new appointment is booked through Appointo. This can include details like date, time, and preparation instructions.

- **Sync Appointments with Google Calendar**: Whenever a new appointment is scheduled in Appointo, automatically create an event in Google Calendar. This helps in keeping personal or team calendars up to date without manual entry.

- **SMS Reminders for Upcoming Appointments**: Setup a workflow where SMS reminders are sent to clients a day before their appointment using Twilio SMS integration. This can reduce no-shows and ensure clients are well-prepared for their meetings.
