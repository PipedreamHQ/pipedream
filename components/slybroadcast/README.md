# Overview

The Slybroadcast API lets you send voice messages directly to the voicemail boxes of your audience without ringing their phones. Integrating this API with Pipedream allows you to automate voice message campaigns, follow-ups, and notifications, by triggering voice messages based on events in other apps or through scheduled workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Follow-Up**: After a customer makes a purchase on your e-commerce platform, automatically send a thank you voice message to foster a personal connection and enhance customer satisfaction.

- **Event-Triggered Alerts**: Set up a workflow where a voice message is sent through Slybroadcast when your monitoring system detects a critical issue, ensuring stakeholders are promptly informed with a personal touch even if they miss an email or text alert.

- **Appointment Reminders**: Connect Slybroadcast to your calendar or booking system to send out voicemail reminders, reducing no-shows for appointments and meetings.
