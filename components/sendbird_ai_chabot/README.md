# Overview

The Sendbird AI Chatbot API enhances user interaction through automated, intelligent messaging. With the ability to comprehend and process user requests, it streamlines communication in apps integrating customer service, e-commerce support, and interactive engagements. Leveraging this API on Pipedream enables the creation of dynamic workflows that can respond to events in real-time, automate responses, and connect with multiple other services for extended functionality.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Automation**: Automate initial customer support interactions in a service app. Use Sendbird AI Chatbot to handle common queries like order status, product details, or troubleshooting steps. If the query becomes too complex, the workflow can escalate the issue by notifying a human agent via Slack or email, ensuring seamless support continuity.

- **Event-Driven Notifications**: In a community or event management application, use Sendbird AI Chatbot to answer FAQs about event details, registration processes, or schedules. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers the chatbot responses based on user messages and can dynamically pull data from a Google Sheets or Airtable containing event information, sending real-time updates or changes to participants.

- **Feedback Collection and Analysis**: Deploy Sendbird AI Chatbot in an app to collect user feedback on services or products. Integrate this with a CRM like HubSpot on Pipedream, where the workflow can analyze sentiment, categorize feedback, and update customer profiles accordingly. This allows for automated follow-ups tailored to the feedback's nature, enhancing customer satisfaction and engagement.
