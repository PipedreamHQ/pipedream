# Overview

Sendbird's AI Chatbot API enables the integration of advanced messaging bots into applications, enhancing customer support and user engagement through automated, intelligent conversations. When combined with Pipedream's capabilities, you can create powerful automations and workflows that respond dynamically to user input, integrate with multiple services (like CRM systems, databases, and other APIs), and manage complex interactions seamlessly.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Automation**: Automatically handle common customer queries using the Sendbird AI Chatbot within your app. Connect the chatbot to a CRM platform like Salesforce on Pipedream to log conversations or escalate issues without manual intervention. This reduces response times and increases customer satisfaction.

- **Event-Driven Notifications**: Use the chatbot to send personalized notifications about events or updates. For instance, integrate Sendbird with Google Calendar via Pipedream to automatically notify users about upcoming events or changes in their schedule, directly through your application's messaging interface.

- **Feedback Collection and Analysis**: Deploy Sendbird AI Chatbot to collect feedback within an application. Link it with a tool like Google Sheets on Pipedream to automatically store user responses. Further, connect this data with a machine learning API to analyze sentiment and feedback trends, helping you make informed decisions about product improvements.
