# Overview

Teach 'n Go is a powerful API that lets educational institutions manage schedules, student data, and communications efficiently. By integrating Teach 'n Go with Pipedream, you can automate routine tasks, sync data across various educational tools, and enhance communication between teachers, students, and parents. Utilizing Pipedream's capabilities, you can set up workflows that trigger actions based on specific events in Teach 'n Go, such as new student registrations or updates to class schedules.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Attendance Reports**: Automatically generate and send daily or weekly attendance reports to teachers and school administrators. Set up a workflow on Pipedream that triggers whenever attendance data is updated in Teach 'n Go. The workflow can process this data to create comprehensive reports and then use an email service like SendGrid to distribute the reports.

- **Student Onboarding Emails**: Streamline the process of welcoming new students. When a new student is added to Teach 'n Go, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends a personalized welcome email using a tool like Mailchimp. This workflow can also include steps to add the student to relevant educational platforms or communication tools.

- **Synchronization with Google Calendar**: Keep everyone's schedules in sync. Create a workflow in Pipedream that listens for changes in the Teach 'n Go class schedules and automatically updates a Google Calendar shared with staff, students, and parents. This ensures that any changes in class timings or new events are immediately reflected on everyone's personal calendars.
