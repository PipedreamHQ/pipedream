# Overview

The Teach 'n Go API provides programmatic access to a robust educational platform, allowing users to manage scheduling, student information, financials, and more. With the API, developers can automate interactions with the Teach 'n Go system, facilitating streamlined operations for educational organizations. Using Pipedream, these capabilities can be extended to integrate seamlessly with other apps, enabling automated workflows that significantly reduce manual overhead and enhance organizational efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Student Onboarding**: Create a workflow in Pipedream that triggers every time a new student is added in Teach 'n Go. It can automatically send personalized welcome emails via SendGrid, schedule introductory sessions on Google Calendar, and create a profile for the student in a CRM like Salesforce.

- **Attendance Tracking and Alerts**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream where attendance data from Teach 'n Go triggers a series of actionsâ€”if a student reaches a predefined absence threshold, automatically send alert emails to the student and their guardian, and notify school counselors via Slack or Microsoft Teams.

- **Invoice and Payment Automation**: Configure a Pipedream workflow that detects when a new invoice is created in Teach 'n Go. It can then automatically send payment reminders via Twilio SMS, update payment status in an accounting tool like QuickBooks, and log this activity in a Google Sheets spreadsheet for financial tracking.
