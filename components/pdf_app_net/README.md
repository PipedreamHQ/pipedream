# Overview

The PDF-app.net API provides capabilities to manipulate PDF files dynamically, allowing you to create, convert, merge, split, and extract data from PDFs programmatically. Leveraging this API on Pipedream enables the automation of document workflows, integrating seamlessly with other services for data extraction, reporting, and file management tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Generation and Emailing**: Combine customer data from a CRM like Salesforce with PDF-app.net on Pipedream to automatically generate invoices as PDFs. Once the PDF is created, use the Email by Zapier app to send the invoice directly to the customer, streamlining the billing process.

- **Daily Sales Reports Compilation**: Set up a scheduled workflow on Pipedream that fetches sales data from e-commerce platforms like Shopify at the end of each day. Use PDF-app.net to format this data into a PDF report and then upload it to Google Drive or Dropbox for easy access and sharing.

- **Event Registration PDF Confirmation**: After a user registers for an event via a platform like Eventbrite, trigger a workflow on Pipedream that uses PDF-app.net to create a personalized registration confirmation PDF. This PDF can include the event details, participant information, and a QR code for entry. Then, automatically email the PDF to the registrant using SendGrid or a similar email service.
