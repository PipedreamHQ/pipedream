# Overview

The CDR Platform API provides tools for automating and integrating processes related to cyber defense and threat intelligence. With this API, you can access and manage threat data, analyze security incidents, and enhance your cybersecurity measures. Pipedream serves as a powerful platform to create workflows leveraging the CDR Platform API, enabling you to connect with numerous other services, orchestrate complex automations, and react to events in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Threat Intelligence Gathering**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow with a scheduled timer to fetch the latest threat intelligence from the CDR Platform. Process this data and pipe it into a Slack channel, alerting your team to new threats immediately.

- **Incident Response Coordination**: Use a webhook to start a Pipedream workflow when a new incident is reported to the CDR Platform. The workflow could then create a ticket in Jira for your response team, ensuring swift action and tracking.

- **Security Dashboard Updates**: Combine the CDR Platform API with a data visualization tool like Google Sheets. Set up a Pipedream workflow to periodically pull the latest security analysis and metrics, then update a Google Sheet that powers a live security dashboard.
