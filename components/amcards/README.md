# Overview

I can build a Markdown document with a few paragraphs, followed by a list of
examples, telling me what I can build using the [AMcards
API](https://amcards.com/>).

Some things I can build using the AMcards API include:

- A card that displays a user's name, location, and website
- A card that links to a user's social media profiles
- A card that displays a user's email address and phone number
- A card that links to a user's resume or CV
- A card that displays a user's skills and experience
- A card that links to a user's portfolio
