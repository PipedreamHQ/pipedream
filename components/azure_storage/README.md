# Overview

Azure Storage on Pipedream provides a powerful way to automate interactions with your cloud storage solutions. This includes creating, reading, updating, and deleting blobs, files, queues, and tables. Leveraging Azure Storage APIs within Pipedream workflows allows you to connect your storage operations with over 800+ apps, streamlining data management and facilitating complex automations that respond in real-time to changes in your storage environment.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Backup Notifications**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a new file is uploaded to an Azure Blob Storage container. The workflow can analyze the file type and size, log this information to a Google Sheets spreadsheet, and send a notification via Slack to notify team members about the backup status.

- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Whenever new data is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage, trigger a Pipedream workflow that processes this data, perhaps converting images, parsing CSV files, or compressing video files. After processing, the workflow can move the processed data to a new Blob for further use or archive.

- **Event-driven Content Distribution**: Use Pipedream to monitor Azure Table Storage for new entries that might contain metadata of newly available content. Trigger a workflow that distributes this content by updating a website via WordPress API, posting on social media platforms like Twitter, and sending email updates to subscribers via SendGrid.
