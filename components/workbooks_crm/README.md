# Overview

The Workbooks CRM API unlocks a treasure trove of possibilities for automating customer relationship management tasks. With this API, you can seamlessly sync contact info, manage sales leads, automate follow-up tasks, and build custom reports to unlock actionable insights. Harnessing the power of the Workbooks CRM API on Pipedream allows you to supercharge these functionalities, triggering workflows on custom events, and connecting to numerous other apps to streamline your CRM processes even further.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sales Lead Auto-Assignment**: Automatically assign new leads to sales reps based on custom criteria such as geographic location or industry. When a new lead is created in Workbooks CRM, a Pipedream workflow can parse the lead details and assign it to the correct sales rep in your team, sending them a notification via Slack or email.
- **Customer Onboarding Sequence**: Kick off a customer onboarding sequence when a deal is marked as won. This could involve sending a series of welcome emails via SendGrid, creating tasks for account managers in Asana, and scheduling a check-in call using the Zoom API.
- **Support Ticket Integration**: Integrate customer support by creating a ticket in a service like Zendesk whenever there is a significant update on a customer's account in Workbooks CRM. Use Pipedream to monitor for changes in account status or other key fields, and automatically create or update tickets in Zendesk to ensure timely customer support.
