# Overview

The ISN API allows developers to access data stored in the ISN system. This
data includes information on properties, inspections, vendors, and more. Using
the ISN API, developers can build applications that allow users to view and
manipulate this data.

Some examples of applications that can be built using the ISN API include:

- A property management application that allows users to view and update
  property information
- An inspection scheduling application that allows users to schedule and track
  inspections
- A vendor management application that allows users to view and update vendor
  information
