# Overview

The Wonderchat API lets you automate interactions with your Wonderchat account, streamlining conversations and enhancing customer engagement. On Pipedream, you can build workflows that trigger on specific events and automate tasks like sending messages, managing contacts, or integrating with CRMs. By coupling the Wonderchat API with Pipedreamâ€™s capabilities, you get a powerful synergy where you can seamlessly connect various apps and services, run serverless code, and manipulate data with ease.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Welcome Messages**: When a new contact is added in Wonderchat, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends a personalized welcome message. This small touch can significantly impact user experience and retention.

- **Sync Contacts with CRM**: Whenever a contact is updated or tagged in Wonderchat, use a Pipedream workflow to sync these changes to a CRM like Salesforce. Keeping customer information up-to-date across platforms enhances sales and support efforts.

- **Customer Support Ticketing**: Integrate Wonderchat with a ticketing system such as Zendesk. When a conversation on Wonderchat reaches a certain threshold or keyword is detected, create a support ticket in Zendesk to ensure no query goes unnoticed.
