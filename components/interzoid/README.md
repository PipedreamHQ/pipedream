# Overview

The Interzoid API offers a plethora of data-driven APIs that enable you to enrich, standardize, and deduplicate data across various fields such as demographics, financials, and text. With these capabilities, you can enhance data quality, drive better analytics, and create more intelligent workflows and applications. In Pipedream, you can integrate these APIs into serverless workflows, triggering actions based on various events, manipulating and routing data to other apps, services, or data stores with ease.

# Example Use Cases

- **Verify Email Addresses in Real-Time**: Upon receiving new email sign-ups through a web form, use Interzoid's Email Information API to verify and score each email in a Pipedream workflow. If the score is acceptable, automatically add the email to a Mailchimp list for marketing campaigns, otherwise flag for review.

- **Standardize and Clean Customer Data**: As new customer data comes in via CRM platforms like Salesforce, harness Interzoid's Global Telephone Information API to format international phone numbers and the Get Full Name Match API to normalize names. Your Pipedream workflow can then update the customer profiles in Salesforce with this standardized information, ensuring data consistency.

- **Currency Exchange Rate Analysis**: Use the Interzoid Get Currency Rate API within Pipedream to fetch real-time currency exchange rates. Combine this data with a time-based trigger to create a daily snapshot of exchange rates. This can be stored in a Google Sheet for historical analysis or used to update pricing information across e-commerce platforms.
