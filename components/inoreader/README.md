# Overview

The Inoreader API taps into the functionality of the Inoreader content reader, allowing the automation of tasks like subscribing to new feeds, listing articles, or marking items as read. In Pipedream, this can be leveraged to create custom workflows that integrate with other apps, trigger actions based on new content, or manage content consumption in a more efficient way.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Distribution**: Create a workflow that monitors specific Inoreader folders or tags for new articles and automatically shares them to social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook with predefined hashtags.

- **Email Digests from Starred Articles**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that collects articles you've starred throughout the day in Inoreader, and sends a neatly formatted digest to your email every evening, ensuring you never miss an important read.

- **Sync Read Status with Task Managers**: Develop a system where articles marked as read in Inoreader trigger updates in a task management app like Todoist, marking related tasks as complete, keeping your reading and productivity apps in sync.
