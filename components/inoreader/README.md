# Overview

The Inoreader API offers a robust platform for automating content curation, management, and distribution tasks, allowing for seamless integration with the diverse toolkit of Pipedream. With Inoreader's API on Pipedream, you can create workflows to track new articles, manage subscriptions, or organize content using a range of triggers and actions. Whether it's for personal use or content distribution, harnessing the Inoreader API via Pipedream can significantly streamline your content workflows.

## Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Digest**: Combine Inoreader with email services like Gmail to send a daily digest. When Inoreader tags new articles in your preferred categories, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that compiles those articles into an email summary sent to your inbox.

- **Social Media Sharing**: Use Inoreader to monitor content feeds, and pair it with Twitter or Facebook on Pipedream. When articles matching your criteria appear, automatically post them to your social media profiles to keep your audience engaged with the latest content.

- **Data Storage and Analysis**: Link Inoreader with Google Sheets or AWS S3 on Pipedream to store and analyze your feeds. As new articles are saved in Inoreader, the workflow can append the article details to a Google Sheet for tracking or upload them to AWS S3 for archival purposes.
