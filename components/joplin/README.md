# Overview

The Joplin API enables you to create, read, update, and delete notes, notebooks, tags, and resources, as well as manage note revisions and searching within Joplin. With Pipedream, you can leverage these API capabilities to automate workflows involving note-taking, organization, and synchronization with other apps. For example, you can build workflows that trigger when you create a new note, append content to an existing note from external sources, or synchronize notes across different platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automatically Create Joplin Notes from Emails**: Set up a workflow that listens for incoming emails using an app like Gmail on Pipedream, parses the email content, and creates a new note in a specified Joplin notebook. This helps you keep track of important emails as part of your note-taking routine.

- **Sync Notes with a Calendar App**: Create a workflow that triggers when a new note with a specific tag is added in Joplin. The workflow can then format the note content and create an event in a calendar app like Google Calendar, with the note details included in the event description. This allows for an integrated planning system that connects notes with scheduled activities.

- **Backup Joplin Notes to Cloud Storage**: Build a workflow that triggers at regular intervals, retrieves notes from Joplin, and then uploads them to a cloud storage service such as Dropbox. This can be used to maintain a backup of your notes or to share them with other users or devices outside of Joplin's native sync functionality.
