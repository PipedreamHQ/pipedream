# Overview

HighLevel (OAuth) API provides a suite of tools for marketing automation, CRM functionalities, and customer communication. Using this API in Pipedream, you can automate interactions with leads, synchronize customer data across platforms, and streamline your sales funnel. It's perfect for creating custom workflows that can capture leads, send targeted campaigns, track customer engagement, and manage client relationships effectively.

## Example Use Cases

- **Automate Lead Capture and Follow-Up**: When a new lead is captured through a HighLevel form, use Pipedream to automatically add them to a nurture campaign, sending personalized follow-up emails or SMS messages.

- **Sync Contacts with External CRMs**: Every time a new contact is added in HighLevel, you can sync it to another CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot, ensuring that all your customer data is always up to date across all your business tools.

- **Dynamic Response Based on Customer Interaction**: Set up a workflow that listens for customer interactions (like email opens or link clicks) and triggers specific marketing actions in HighLevel, such as tagging for segmentation or initiating a different communication sequence.
