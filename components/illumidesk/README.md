# Overview

The Illumidesk API integrates virtual learning environments with tools that facilitate instruction and collaboration. On Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate educational workflows, manage courses, and interact with users. Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform lets you create workflows triggered by various events without maintaining infrastructure, focusing on the logic and integration between services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate User Enrollment**: Sync Illumidesk course enrollments with a database by triggering a workflow whenever a new user registers. Enroll them in the appropriate course based on their profile and log their details.

- **Assignment Submission Notifications**: Set up a workflow to send notifications via Slack or email when a student submits an assignment. Use Pipedream's ability to connect with SMTP services or Slack to deliver timely updates to instructors.

- **Course Material Updates**: Whenever course material is updated on Illumidesk, trigger a Pipedream workflow to update the material on connected platforms like Google Classroom or GitHub, ensuring all resources are consistent across platforms.
