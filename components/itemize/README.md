# Overview

The Itemize API enables automated processing and organization of receipts, invoices, and other financial documents. By harnessing machine learning, it extracts pertinent data such as dates, amounts, taxes, and vendor information, converting cluttered paperwork into structured data. This can be a boon for accounting, expense tracking, and financial auditing workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Expense Reporting Automation**: Streamline expense management by connecting Itemize to an HR system like BambooHR. When receipts are uploaded to Itemize, data is extracted and sent to BambooHR to create or update expense reports, cutting down on manual data entry and speeding up reimbursement processes.

- **Financial Data Syncing**: Keep financial records in real-time sync across platforms. Use Itemize to extract data from invoices, which can then be pushed to QuickBooks or Xero via Pipedream. This automation ensures that your accounting records always reflect the latest transactions without the need for manual updates.

- **Compliance Auditing Workflow**: Enhance compliance and auditing by integrating Itemize with a document management system such as Box. As financial documents are processed through Itemize, extracted information can be stored in structured formats in Box, with automated alerts set up to flag anomalies or discrepancies for review by the compliance team.
