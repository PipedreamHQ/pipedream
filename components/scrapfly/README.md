# Overview

Scrapfly API empowers developers to scrape web data efficiently by handling challenges like headless browser management, CAPTCHAs, and proxy rotation. Pipedream, with its robust integration capabilities, allows you to automate workflows by connecting Scrapfly to an array of other apps for data parsing, storage, or further processing. This unlocks potential for real-time data-driven decisions and streamlined operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time Price Monitoring**: Automate the scraping of product prices from multiple e-commerce sites using Scrapfly. Process and compare these prices in real-time, and use Pipedream to trigger alerts or updates to a Google Sheets document whenever a significant price change is detected.

- **Content Change Detection**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that uses Scrapfly to monitor changes on specific websites (such as news sites or corporate pages). When a change is detected, the workflow can push notifications via Slack or email, ensuring that your team stays informed about latest updates without manual monitoring.

- **Competitor Analysis Automation**: Use Scrapfly to scrape competitor websites for new products, marketing strategies, or content updates. Pipedream can then analyze this data and integrate with tools like Airtable or a custom database to keep a structured record. This can be further enhanced with periodic reports generated and sent through email or a communication platform like Microsoft Teams.
