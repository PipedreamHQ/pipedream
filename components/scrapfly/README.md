# Overview

The Scrapfly API provides robust web scraping capabilities, allowing users to extract data from websites efficiently. Integrated with Pipedream, this API can power automated workflows to gather and process data from various web sources. This data can then be used for market research, competitive analysis, real-time content aggregation, or monitoring website changes. The API's ability to handle large volumes of requests and manage proxy rotations makes it particularly useful for scalable and reliable scraping operations.

# Example Use Cases

This workflow can trigger daily or in real-time as prices change, providing businesses with up-to-date market insights.

- **Content Aggregation for News Outlets**: Create a workflow that uses Scrapfly to scrape the latest news content from various online news portals. The scraped data can be processed and pushed to a CMS like WordPress or sent via Slack to content teams for rapid publishing or further editorial review.

- **SEO Monitoring Tool**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that uses Scrapfly to regularly scrape your companyâ€™s and competitors' website pages. Analyze changes in SEO practices or content updates. Integrate this with Slack to send automated alerts about significant changes or schedule regular update reports to keep the marketing team informed.
