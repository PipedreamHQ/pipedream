# Overview

The Ragic API offers a robust way to interact with your Ragic databases, enabling you to create, read, update, and delete records programmatically. With its API, you can automate data entry, synchronize data across platforms, and trigger custom workflows. Pipedream amplifies these capabilities with a serverless platform where you can deploy these automations rapidly, reacting to events in Ragic or orchestrating actions across multiple apps.

# Getting Started

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Backup**: Schedule a daily Pipedream workflow to fetch records from Ragic and save them to Google Sheets, ensuring your data is backed up and easily accessible for reporting.

- **Lead Management**: When a new lead is entered into Ragic, trigger a Pipedream workflow to enrich the lead data using Clearbit, then push the enhanced data to Salesforce and notify your sales team via Slack.

- **Inventory Tracking**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that detects when inventory levels in Ragic fall below a threshold, automatically reordering stock from suppliers through an email API and updating the Ragic inventory records accordingly.
