Fraud Detection for E-commerce

The FraudLabs Pro API enables e-commerce businesses to detect fraudulent orders with ease. Businesses can simply send in an order’s information, and FraudLabs Pro will return a fraud score and report explaining the decision. This allows businesses to make informed decisions on whether to accept, flag, or reject an order.

FraudLabs Pro can help e-commerce businesses in the following ways:

- Detect fraudulent orders
- Reduce chargebacks and fraud-related losses
- Prevent fraudsters from abusing the system

Here are some examples of what you can build with the FraudLabs Pro API:

- A fraud detection system for your e-commerce website
- A chargeback prevention system for your business
- A fraud monitoring system to track fraudsters and their activities
