# Overview

Browserless allows you to build websites and applications that can be used
without a web browser. This means that you can create apps that can be used
offline, or that can be used on devices that don't have a web browser
installed.

Some examples of things that you can build using Browserless are:

- A website that can be used without a web browser
- An app that can be used offline
- A app that can be used on devices that don't have a web browser installed
