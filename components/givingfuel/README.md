# Overview

The GivingFuel API enables non-profit organizations to automate their donation processes, manage donor information, and analyze donation data directly within Pipedream. By leveraging this API, you can create workflows that streamline the collection and use of donation information, trigger actions based on donation events, and integrate with other apps to enrich the donor's journey or facilitate the management of fundraising campaigns.

# Example Use Cases

- **Donation Triggered Thank You Email**: When a new donation is received via GivingFuel, a workflow can be triggered that sends a personalized thank you email to the donor. This can be done by integrating with email platforms like SendGrid or Mailgun within Pipedream.

- **Donor Data Synchronization**: Keep your CRM updated by synchronizing new donor information from GivingFuel to CRM systems like Salesforce or HubSpot. Whenever a new donor contributes, the workflow creates or updates their record in your CRM, ensuring your donor database is always current.

- **Donation Summary Reports**: Generate daily or weekly donation summary reports and send them to your team via Slack or email. This allows for real-time insights into fundraising progress and helps inform strategy decisions based on the latest data.
