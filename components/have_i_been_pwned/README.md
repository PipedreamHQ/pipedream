# Overview

The Have I Been Pwned API allows you to check if an email or domain has been compromised in a data breach. This powerful tool can be integrated within Pipedream workflows to automate security monitoring and alerting, helping to maintain digital safety proactively. By leveraging real-time data from Have I Been Pwned, users can set up automated processes to regularly check for potential breaches and react swiftly to secure affected systems or notify stakeholders.

# Example Use Cases

- **Employee Email Monitoring**: Automatically monitor and report on company email addresses. If an employeeâ€™s email appears in a breach, the workflow can trigger immediate notification emails to IT security and the affected person, recommending password changes and other security measures.

- **Customer Trust Enhancement**: Integrate Have I Been Pwned checks into your customer onboarding processes. When a new email is registered, the workflow can check if the email has been compromised before and alert the customer service team to provide guidance on secure account setup.

- **Regular Domain Scans for Compliance**: Set up a scheduled workflow that scans your corporate domains against the Have I Been Pwned database and logs the results. This can be useful for compliance with data protection regulations, ensuring that any breach involving your domain is known and addressed promptly.
