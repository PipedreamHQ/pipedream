# Overview

Mission Mobile specializes in SMS solutions, facilitating powerful ways to connect organizations directly with their audience via mobile messaging.

Using Pipedream, these capabilities can be leveraged to create workflows that respond to various triggers from other apps, process data, and utilize SMS for notifications, data collection, and user engagement.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Feedback Collection via SMS after E-Commerce Purchases**: Automate the process of collecting customer feedback after a purchase. When a new order is registered in Shopify, use Pipedream to trigger an SMS via Mission Mobile to the customer, asking for feedback. The response can be logged and analyzed for insights.

- **Appointment Reminders for Healthcare Providers**: Integrate Mission Mobile with a healthcare provider's scheduling system (like Google Calendar). Set up a Pipedream workflow that automatically sends SMS reminders to patients 24 hours before their appointments, reducing no-shows and improving operational efficiency.

- **Real-Time Event Alerts for IT Monitoring**: Link Mission Mobile with monitoring tools like Datadog. Configure a Pipedream workflow to send SMS alerts via Mission Mobile to the IT team when critical incidents or performance anomalies are detected, enabling swift response to potentially service-impacting events.
