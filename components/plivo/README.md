# Overview

The Plivo API taps into the power of cloud communication, allowing you to programmatically send SMS messages, make voice calls, and manage user verifications among other telephony functions. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can easily integrate Plivo into workflows that automate these communication tasks, react to incoming messages or calls, and connect with numerous other apps for comprehensive automation solutions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Ticket Creation via SMS**: When a customer sends a support query via SMS to your Plivo number, a Pipedream workflow can intercept that message, extract the content, and automatically create a support ticket in a service like Zendesk. This streamlines the support process and ensures timely responses.

- **Appointment Reminder Calls**: Use Plivo to automate voice call reminders for appointments. A Pipedream workflow can schedule calls based on your calendar events in Google Calendar, extract the necessary details, and trigger Plivo to call clients with personalized reminders, reducing no-shows and improving client relations.

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) with One-Time Passwords (OTP)**: Enhance security by implementing 2FA using SMS OTPs sent through Plivo. A workflow on Pipedream could listen for authentication requests from your app, generate a secure OTP, and leverage Plivo to send this password to the user's phone. The workflow can then verify the submitted OTP against the generated one, providing an extra layer of security to user logins.
