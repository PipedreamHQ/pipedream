# Overview

The Eagle Doc API allows users to automate document management processes, including generation, storage, and retrieval of documents. This API can be especially useful in environments where documentation needs to be dynamically created and linked with various data points from different sources. On Pipedream, leveraging Eagle Doc with other integrated apps can streamline workflows that require heavy documentation handling, such as in legal, finance, or HR sectors.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Generation and Storage**: - Use Eagle Doc API on Pipedream to generate contracts based on data received from a CRM system like Salesforce. Once the contracts are generated, they can be automatically stored in Eagle Doc and linked back to the respective customer records in Salesforce.

- **Dynamic Report Compilation for Projects**: - Combine Eagle Doc with Google Sheets on Pipedream to automatically generate end-of-month reports. Input data can be collected from Google Sheets, used to create detailed documents via Eagle Doc, and then these documents can be emailed to stakeholders using a service like SendGrid integrated into the workflow.

- **Employee Onboarding Documentation**: - Set up a Pipedream workflow where new employee data from an HR platform like BambooHR triggers the creation of personalized onboarding documents through Eagle Doc. These documents can then be stored in a secure cloud storage like Google Drive and shared with specific folders or personnel.
