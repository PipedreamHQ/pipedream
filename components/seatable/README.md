# Overview

The SeaTable API allows you to interact programmatically with SeaTable databases. With it, you can create, update, and delete records, rows, and columns, manipulate tables, and manage users. In Pipedream, you can harness this API to automate data flows between SeaTable and other apps, trigger workflows based on changes in your SeaTable bases, and manipulate data without manual intervention. Think of it as connecting your spreadsheets' data to the wider web.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Entry from Web Forms to SeaTable**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow with a new form submission from Typeform. Extract the data and create a new row in a SeaTable base to keep track of survey results or lead information without lifting a finger.

- **Sync SeaTable Records with Google Calendar**: Whenever a new event is added to a SeaTable base, such as a project deadline or a meeting, use Pipedream to create a corresponding event in Google Calendar. This ensures your schedule is always up-to-date across platforms.

- **Aggregate Social Media Metrics in SeaTable**: Collect social media stats from platforms like Twitter or Facebook via their APIs and insert the data into SeaTable. Use Pipedream to run this workflow daily, giving you a clear, continually updated view of your social media performance metrics.
