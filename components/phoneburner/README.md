# Overview

The PhoneBurner API provides programmatic access to call center functionality, allowing you to manage contacts, handle dial sessions, and interact with call logs. With Pipedream, you can automate workflows that respond to events in PhoneBurner or orchestrate PhoneBurner actions based on triggers from other apps. This melds the power of cloud telephony with broad integration possibilities, unlocking productivity gains and streamlined operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Contacts from CRM to PhoneBurner**: Create a workflow in Pipedream that listens for new or updated contacts in your CRM system (like Salesforce or HubSpot). When a change is detected, the workflow can automatically update or add the contact's details to PhoneBurner, keeping your call lists current without manual entry.

- **Automate Follow-Up Emails After Calls**: After a call is completed in PhoneBurner, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends a personalized follow-up email via a service like SendGrid or Gmail. This workflow can pull details from the call log to tailor the message, ensuring timely and relevant communication with the prospect or customer.

- **Log Calls to a Database or Google Sheets**: Use Pipedream to catch webhook events from PhoneBurner after calls are made. The workflow can then log call details, such as duration, outcome, and notes, into a database like PostgreSQL or a Google Sheets spreadsheet for record-keeping and advanced analysis.
