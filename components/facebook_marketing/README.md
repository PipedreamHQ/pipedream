# Overview

The Facebook Custom Audiences API allows you to create and manage your Custom Audiences on Facebook for ad targeting. With Pipedream, you can automate workflows involving Custom Audiences, such as synchronizing email lists, updating audience membership based on customer interactions, or triggering ad campaigns in response to specific events. Pipedream's serverless platform simplifies integrating this API with 3,000+ other apps, enabling complex automation without the need for a dedicated backend.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Email Subscribers to Custom Audience**: Automatically add new subscribers from your email marketing platform (e.g., Mailchimp) to a Facebook Custom Audience, ensuring your ads reach those who've shown recent interest in your content.

- **Update Custom Audience Based on Purchase Behavior**: Trigger a workflow with a webhook when a customer makes a purchase. Use the Custom Audiences API to add them to a "Recent Purchasers" audience for upsell campaigns or exclude them from initial acquisition ads to optimize ad spend.

- **Automate Audience Management with CRM Events**: When a contact's status updates in your CRM (like Salesforce), use Pipedream to adjust their membership in Custom Audiences. For instance, moving a lead to a "Warm Leads" audience if they've interacted with a sales rep, enhancing the relevance of your ad targeting.
