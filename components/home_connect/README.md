# Overview

The Home Connect API allows your smart home devices to communicate with Pipedream’s serverless platform, enabling you to create custom automations and interactions. With this API, you can control and monitor your connected home appliances from Bosch, Siemens, Neff, Gaggenau, and Thermador. Fetch appliance status, send commands, and receive event notifications—all programmable in Pipedream to trigger workflows that fit into your digital ecosystem.

# Example Use Cases

- **Morning Routine Automation**: Start your day smoothly by creating a workflow that brews your coffee as soon as your morning alarm goes off. Integrate with the Google Calendar API to check your first appointment and ensure the coffee is ready when you are.

- **Laundry Status Notifications**: Get real-time alerts on your phone or via email when your washing machine cycle completes. Pair Home Connect with Twilio or SendGrid on Pipedream to send these notifications, so you can manage your time without worrying about checking the laundry repeatedly.

- **Smart Oven Preheating**: Prepare dinner effortlessly by preheating your oven with a single voice command. Use Home Connect with a Voice Assistant service on Pipedream to trigger the oven to preheat to your desired temperature while you focus on prepping the ingredients.
