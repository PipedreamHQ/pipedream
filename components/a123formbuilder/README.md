# Overview

The 123FormBuilder API enables you to automate form and data management tasks, allowing seamless integration with Pipedream's serverless platform. With this API, you can fetch submitted form data in real-time, update form structures, or manage respondents and their submissions programmatically. Harnessing the power of the 123FormBuilder API in Pipedream workflows unlocks the potential for dynamic data collection, efficient data processing, and connectivity with a myriad of other services for an enhanced data-driven ecosystem.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Collection and Storage**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever a new form submission is received on 123FormBuilder. Process the data within the workflow, and then save it to a Google Sheets document or a database like PostgreSQL for persistent storage and analysis.

- **Dynamic Respondent Follow-up**: After a form submission, use the submission data to send personalized follow-up emails via SendGrid or create a support ticket in Zendesk. This workflow can be tailored to provide different responses based on the submitted data, ensuring a customized interaction with each respondent.

- **Real-time Notifications and Reporting**: Set up a workflow to monitor form submissions and send real-time notifications to a Slack channel or a Discord server. This allows a team to instantly respond to inquiries or orders. Extend this by integrating with a reporting tool like Power BI to generate insights and visualize submission trends.
