# Example Use Cases

- **SMS Alert System for eCommerce Order Updates**: Connect Twilio with Shopify to send SMS updates to customers when their order status changes. Apply conditions to trigger messages for order confirmation, shipment tracking, and delivery notifications, adding a personal touch to the online shopping experience.

- **Automated Customer Support Ticketing**: Use Twilio with Zendesk to create a support ticket when a customer sends a text message to your Twilio number. This workflow automates the ticket generation process, ensuring that customer issues are promptly recorded and queued for support staff attention without manual entry.

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for App Security**: Integrate Twilio with your custom app's authentication system to send a one-time passcode via SMS for 2FA. Enhance security by incorporating an extra verification step, making it tougher for unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive information or accounts.
