# Overview

The Emailable API offers robust email verification services, allowing you to improve deliverability and protect your sender reputation by validating email addresses in real-time. With Pipedream, you can integrate the Emailable API into serverless workflows, automating the process of cleaning your mailing lists, triggering actions based on email verification results, and syncing data across multiple platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Email Verification for New Subscribers**: When a new user subscribes via a web form, automatically verify their email address with Emailable to ensure it's valid before adding them to your email marketing platform or database.

- **Scheduled List Cleaning**: Set up a scheduled workflow to regularly validate email addresses on your mailing lists. Connect Emailable with your email marketing service like Mailchimp or SendGrid to remove or tag invalid emails, keeping your lists up-to-date and reducing bounce rates.

- **User Signup Validation**: Integrate Emailable with a user registration system. When a new user signs up, instantly verify their email with Emailable. If the email is invalid, trigger an immediate alert or prompt the user for an alternative email address, ensuring only valid users are onboarded.
