# Action Builder

The Action Builder API enables developers to build custom Actions for the Google Assistant. With the API, developers can define the behavior of their Action, as well as the user interface. The API also provides access to the Google Assistant's natural language processing capabilities, so that developers can build Actions that can understand user input.
