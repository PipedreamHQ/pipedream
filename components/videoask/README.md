# Overview

VideoAsk is a versatile platform for creating interactive, video-based forms and surveys. With the VideoAsk API, you can automate the collection and management of these video interactions via Pipedream. This allows for dynamic, personalized engagement with users, as well as the streamlining of follow-up processes and data analysis. The API enables you to programmatically retrieve responses, manage contacts, and trigger actions based on user inputs.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Feedback Collection**: Automate the aggregation of customer feedback by connecting VideoAsk with a CRM like HubSpot. After a customer completes a video survey, their responses can trigger the creation of a contact in the CRM, along with associated feedback notes.

- **Support Ticket Creation**: Use VideoAsk to collect support requests and automatically create tickets in a helpdesk system like Zendesk. Video responses can be converted to tickets, with video links attached, ensuring that support staff have all the context they need.

- **Course Engagement Analytics**: For online educators using platforms such as Teachable, responses to VideoAsk prompts can be used to gauge student engagement. Record completion of course modules in Teachable or trigger personalized follow-up messages based on student interaction with video content.
