# Overview

The BigMailer API enables you to automate your email marketing by interacting with your BigMailer account programmatically. On Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create workflows that respond to events, manage contacts, campaigns, and analyze the effectiveness of your email strategies. By connecting BigMailer to other apps on Pipedream, you can orchestrate complex automations and streamline your email operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Users to BigMailer Contact List**: When a new user signs up on your platform, trigger a workflow on Pipedream that adds their details to a specified BigMailer contact list. This keeps your email lists up-to-date without manual intervention.

- **Automate Campaign Analytics Reporting**: After an email campaign ends, use Pipedream to fetch analytics from the BigMailer API and send a detailed report to your Slack channel or Google Sheets. Here, you're combining BigMailer's analytical capabilities with Pipedream's integrations to facilitate instant reporting.

- **Transactional Email Triggers Based on User Activity**: Set up a workflow where certain user actions in your app (like completing a purchase) trigger Pipedream to send a transactional email through BigMailer. This method ensures timely communication with customers, fostering a more engaged user experience.
