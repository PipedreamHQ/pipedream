# Overview

The Unity Cloud Build API provides a powerful way to automate your builds and
take advantage of incremental cloud builds on multiple platforms. With this
API, developers can create a cloud-based build pipeline, enabling them to
create builds on the fly and maintain a consistently high-quality product.

The Unity Cloud Build API is an ideal tool for streamlining the build process
and taking full advantage of the cloud. With the API, developers can:

- Automate build processes and speed up time to deploy
- Generate multiple builds for different platforms, including Linux, Android,
  iOS, WebGL, and UWP
- Track build progress and performance in real-time
- Create customized scripts for automated build tasks
- Access and manage build artifacts
- Create custom rules for automated builds

Examples of products that can be built using the Unity Cloud Build API include:

- 3D games for mobile, console, web, and desktop
- Educational simulations
- Multi-player battle games
- Virtual reality applications
- Augmented reality experiences
- Visual visualizations and interactive data visualizations
- Interactive presentations and training materials
- Online marketplaces
