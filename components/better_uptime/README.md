# Overview

The Better Uptime API allows users to automate incident management and monitor the status of various systems. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to create custom workflows that trigger actions based on the status of your monitored endpoints. You can receive alerts, automate incident resolution tasks, or sync incident data with other tools, enhancing your operational efficiency and reducing downtime.

# Example Use Cases

- **Incident Alert to Slack**: When Better Uptime detects an incident, trigger a Pipedream workflow to send a notification to a designated Slack channel. This ensures that your team is alerted immediately and can take quick action.

- **Auto-Create Incident Tickets in Jira**: On a new incident, automatically create a ticket in Jira through Pipedream. This workflow can include details such as the incident's time, nature, and affected system, keeping your issue tracking synchronized and up to date without manual entry.

- **Sync Incidents to Google Sheets**: Maintain an audit trail by pushing incident reports into a Google Sheets spreadsheet using Pipedream. Each incident can be logged with timestamps, status updates, and resolution notes, allowing for easy tracking and analysis over time.
