# Overview

The Keysender API offers a unique capability to automate the process of sending product keys or digital goods instantly after a payment transaction. By integrating this API with Pipedream, you can craft seamless workflows for e-commerce automation, customer support, and digital product distribution. Pipedream's serverless platform lets you connect Keysender with various apps for triggering actions, processing data, and responding to events in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **E-commerce Purchase Fulfillment**: Integrate Keysender with an e-commerce platform like Shopify. When a customer makes a purchase, trigger a Pipedream workflow that calls the Keysender API to send the product key or digital asset directly to the customer's email address.

- **Customer Support Ticket Resolution**: Connect Keysender with a customer support tool like Zendesk. Use a Pipedream workflow to automatically send a replacement product key when a support ticket with a specific tag, such as "lost key", is resolved.

- **Digital Inventory Management**: Pair Keysender with a database service like Airtable. Create a Pipedream workflow that monitors an Airtable base for low inventory alerts and uses the Keysender API to generate and stock up on product keys, ensuring you never run out of digital goods to sell.
