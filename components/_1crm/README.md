# Overview

The 1CRM API enables robust integration of 1CRM systems with external applications, facilitating automated workflows and data synchronization. With Pipedream, you can leverage this API to connect 1CRM with hundreds of other services, automate repetitive tasks, streamline sales processes, and enhance customer relationship management. By creating workflows on Pipedream, you can trigger actions in 1CRM based on events from other apps, manipulate and analyze CRM data, and improve overall business efficiency without manual intervention.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Sync from Google Forms to 1CRM**: Automatically create a new lead in 1CRM whenever a Google Form is submitted. This workflow can capture information such as name, email, and phone number directly into your CRM, helping your sales team follow up promptly.

- **Customer Support Ticket Creation**: When a customer sends an email to a designated support address, parse the email content using Pipedream and create a support case in 1CRM. This ensures that every customer issue is tracked and managed systematically within 1CRM without manual data entry.

- **Slack Notifications for New Opportunities**: Set up a workflow where new opportunities created in 1CRM trigger a notification in a Slack channel. This keeps your team instantly informed about new sales prospects and can accelerate the response time, enhancing the chance to close deals quicker.
