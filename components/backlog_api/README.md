# Overview

Backlog is a project management tool that enables developers to track and manage their work. The Backlog API allows developers to programmatically access and manipulate their Backlog data. With the Backlog API, developers can build tools and applications that automate and streamline their Backlog workflow.

Some examples of what you can build with the Backlog API:

- A tool to automatically add new Backlog tasks to your project when code is committed to your version control system
- A dashboard that displays your team's Backlog progress
- A tool to help you ensure that all your Backlog tasks are properly assigned
- An integration that automatically creates Backlog tickets when new issues are filed in your bug tracker
