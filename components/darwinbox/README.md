# Overview

Darwinbox is a cloud-based Human Resources Management System (HRMS) that streamulates HR processes from recruitment to retirement. With the Darwinbox API, you can automate various HR tasks such as employee onboarding, performance appraisals, and leave management. The API allows you to synchronize employee data across different systems, automate HR workflows, and build custom integrations to extend the capabilities of your HR tech stack.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Employee Onboarding**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a new employee is added in Darwinbox. This workflow can send a welcome email, create accounts in third-party services like Slack or G Suite, and add the new hire to relevant Asana projects for onboarding tasks.

- **Leave Request Approval**: Set up a workflow that listens for leave requests in Darwinbox. When a request is detected, the workflow can automatically post a message in a manager's Slack channel for approval. Once approved, the workflow updates the leave status in Darwinbox and syncs the information with a Google Calendar.

- **Performance Review Reminders**: Create a Pipedream workflow that runs on a schedule to check for upcoming performance reviews in Darwinbox. If a review is due, the workflow can send reminder emails to the employees and their managers, and post a reminder in the team's project management tool, like Trello, to ensure the review is completed in time.
