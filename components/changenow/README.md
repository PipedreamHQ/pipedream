# Overview

The ChangeNOW API provides a platform for instant cryptocurrency exchange services, enabling users to swap cryptocurrencies without the need for registration or creating an account. It offers functionalities such as getting currency exchange rates, transaction statuses, and creating new transactions. Within Pipedream, this API can be used to automate workflows involving cryptocurrency trades, monitor exchange rates, and even trigger actions based on these rates or transaction statuses.

# Example Use Cases
