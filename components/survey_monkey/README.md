# Overview

The SurveyMonkey API provides dynamic access to survey creation, retrieval, and distribution functionality, along with deep insights into responses. With Pipedream’s serverless integration platform, you can automate custom workflows that trigger actions based on survey events, analyze survey data, or synchronize survey results with other data sources. Pipedream’s ability to connect with hundreds of apps opens up a vast landscape of automation possibilities, directly integrating with data visualization tools, CRMs, marketing platforms, and more.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Survey Response Processing**: When a new survey response is received, trigger a Pipedream workflow to parse the data, perform sentiment analysis using a tool like the Google Natural Language API, and then store the results in a Google Sheets spreadsheet for team collaboration and real-time analysis.

- **Survey Distribution via Email Campaigns**: For every new contact added to a Mailchimp list, use a Pipedream workflow to automatically send a personalized SurveyMonkey survey link. Then, based on survey completion, trigger a follow-up campaign or tag the contact for segmentation and targeted marketing efforts.

- **Real-time Survey Alerts and Reporting**: Configure a Pipedream workflow to monitor for new survey completions. When a completion is detected, use the workflow to format a summary and send it via Slack to a designated channel, or via email to stakeholders. This ensures immediate visibility of survey results and enables quick action on the collected feedback.
