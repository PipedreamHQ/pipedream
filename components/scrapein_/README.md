# Overview

The Soax API provides access to a robust proxy and scraping service that allows users to gather data efficiently and safely from across the web. By leveraging Soax’s rotating proxies, you can access and retrieve data without triggering anti-scraping measures, making it useful for tasks like competitive analysis, market research, SEO monitoring, and more. Integrating Soax with Pipedream enhances these capabilities by automating data collection workflows, enriching the data with other services, and triggering actions based on the retrieved data.
