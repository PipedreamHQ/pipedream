# Overview

The Crunchbase API grants access to a trove of information on companies, investors, and the key players steering them. With Pipedream, you can harness this data to enrich CRM leads, track investments, or automate market research. By marrying the Crunchbase API with Pipedream's serverless platform, you unlock a realm of possibilities, creating workflows that respond dynamically to events like funding rounds or acquisitions, or that periodically aggregate data for analysis.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Enrichment in Salesforce**: Sync company data from Crunchbase to Salesforce leads. When a company in your lead database gets new funding, use Pipedream to update the lead's profile with the latest financial data and trigger a follow-up task in Salesforce.

- **Investment Alerts via Email**: Monitor specific sectors or companies for new funding rounds. Set up a Pipedream workflow that checks Crunchbase for updates and sends an email alert via SendGrid to your investment team with curated insights and details about the latest funding events.

- **Market Trends Dashboard**: Populate a Google Sheets dashboard with market trends data. Use Pipedream to periodically pull the latest industry-specific data from Crunchbase and push it to Google Sheets, keeping your dashboard updated with fresh insights for strategic decision-making.
