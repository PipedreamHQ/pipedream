# Overview

The Satuit API enables seamless integration of asset management and CRM functionalities into various business processes. With it, you can automate tasks such as data synchronization, report generation, and client management. Pipedream, with its serverless execution model, allows you to connect Satuit to 3,000+ other apps to create powerful workflows without managing any infrastructure. You could, for instance, trigger a workflow with a new database entry, process the data within Pipedream, and then use the Satuit API to update customer records or create tasks for follow-ups.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Client Onboarding**: Upon receiving a new client form submission from a website (like Typeform or Google Forms), use Pipedream to parse the submitted data and automatically create a new client record in Satuit.

- **Sync Email Campaign Responses**: Connect Satuit with an email marketing service like Mailchimp via Pipedream. When a recipient opens an email or clicks a link, it triggers a Pipedream workflow that logs the activity in the Satuit CRM, helping you to keep track of engagement.

- **Daily Portfolio Reports**: Set up a Pipedream scheduled workflow to generate daily portfolio reports from Satuit and send them to stakeholders via a messaging platform like Slack. This ensures that all relevant parties receive timely investment updates.
