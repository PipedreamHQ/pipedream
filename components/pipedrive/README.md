# What can be Built with the Pipedrive API?

The Pipedrive API is a powerful source of data that allows developers to build custom applications and integrations that can "plug-and-play" into the back-end of Pipedrive. With a few lines of code, developers can create amazing ways to use Pipedrive's data for productivity and success. Here are a few examples of what can be done with the Pipedrive API:

1. Automate the addition of leads into the back-end of Pipedrive from other sources such as Salesforce, or other 3rd party applications.
2. Customize new views and filters for managing deals and activities.
3. Integrate with other platforms to build custom reports and insights.
4. Develop custom modules such as invoice generation and payment processing.
5. Create custom tasks, reminders, and notifications that sync with other tools and platforms.
6. Automate the creation of tasks and activities based on arbitrary criteria.
7. Monitor and track changes that happen within Pipedrive with webhooks.
8. Create dynamic logic-driven processes with automated decision making.
9. Create custom dashboards and data visualizations to get an overview of the business performance.
10. Automatically export data to other cloud-based services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or other cloud-based applications.
