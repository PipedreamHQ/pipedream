# Overview

The Missive API allows users to streamline their email and team communication within the Pipedream platform. It offers access to manage conversations, collaborate on emails, and automate workflows involving your communication stack. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to integrate Missive with various other apps, enhance your team's productivity, and create custom automation based on triggers like new emails or conversation status changes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Customer Support Ticket Creation**: When a conversation is tagged with "support" in Missive, trigger a workflow that creates a ticket in a customer support platform like Zendesk. This ensures that your support team immediately knows about the issue and can track it through to resolution.

- **Sync Missive Conversations to CRM**: Each time a conversation is marked as 'closed' in Missive, automatically sync relevant details to a CRM tool like Salesforce. This can include the conversation summary, customer contact info, and any follow-up tasks, keeping your sales team informed and your CRM up to date.

- **Email Campaign Analytics Reporting**: After sending out a marketing campaign, use Missive to tag conversations that come back with specific responses. Then, set up a Pipedream workflow that collects these conversations and sends a daily or weekly digest to your marketing team's Slack channel for quick review and analysis.
