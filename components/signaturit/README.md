# Overview

The Signaturit API enables automated document signing, tracking, and management directly within Pipedream. By integrating this API, users can create workflows to send documents for signature, check the status of sent documents, and receive updates when documents are signed or declined, all from a serverless platform. By leveraging Pipedream's capacity for integrating various APIs and services, users can seamlessly include e-signature capabilities into their business processes without manual intervention.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Workflow**: When a new client is added to a CRM like Salesforce, automatically trigger a workflow in Pipedream to send a contract for signature via Signaturit. Once signed, the contract can be saved to a cloud storage service such as Google Drive and the CRM record updated.

- **HR Onboarding Process**: Automate the employee onboarding process by triggering an onboarding workflow in Pipedream when a new employee is added to an HR platform like BambooHR. Send employment documents through Signaturit for e-signature and store signed documents in a secure location, notifying HR upon completion.

- **Real Estate Closing Documents**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to monitor a project management tool like Trello for a card move that indicates a property sale is finalizing. Automatically send closing documents to the buyer for signature through Signaturit and notify the real estate agent upon document completion.
