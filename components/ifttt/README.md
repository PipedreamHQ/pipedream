# Overview

IFTTT (If This Then That) is a service that lets you create chains of conditional statements, known as applets. These applets can automate tasks across a variety of web services and APIs. By integrating IFTTT with Pipedream, you unlock the ability to handle complex logic, manage state, transform data, and interact with over 3,000+ supported apps in Pipedream’s ecosystem. You can trigger workflows on Pipedream with events from IFTTT and vice versa, creating a seamless automation experience.

# Example Use Cases

- **Smart Home Alerts to Slack**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow when your smart home device (connected via IFTTT) detects motion. The workflow processes the event and sends a formatted alert message to a Slack channel, keeping your team informed of security at your premises.

- **Social Media Performance Tracking**: When a new post is made on your Instagram account (through IFTTT), trigger a workflow on Pipedream to retrieve the post’s performance data like likes and comments after 24 hours. Then, log this data in a Google Sheets spreadsheet for analysis and reporting.

- **Email Digest of Daily Activities**: Use IFTTT to monitor your fitness app for daily activity summaries. Once it detects a summary, it triggers a Pipedream workflow which aggregates the data and sends you an email digest using the SendGrid app on Pipedream at the end of the day.
