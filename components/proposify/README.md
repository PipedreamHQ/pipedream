# Overview

The Proposify API enables users to automate and integrate their proposal workflows directly into their broader sales and project management ecosystems. With this API, users can create, update, send, and manage proposals, streamlining how sales teams interact with potential clients. Key functionalities include access to proposal data, client information, and the ability to trigger actions based on proposal status changes. When used on Pipedream, the Proposify API can connect with other apps to automate notifications, sync data, and enhance visibility across different platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Proposal Status Updates to Slack**: - When a proposal status changes in Proposify (e.g., from "Draft" to "Sent"), trigger a workflow in Pipedream that posts a customizable message to a designated Slack channel. This keeps the team instantly informed about proposal progress without needing to manually check Proposify.

- **Sync Proposals with a CRM System**: - Automatically update or create new leads in a CRM like Salesforce whenever a proposal is sent or accepted in Proposify. This workflow can help maintain alignment between sales efforts and client management systems, ensuring that all client interactions are up-to-date and tracked centrally.

- **Generate Reports and Send via Email**: - Set up a scheduled workflow in Pipedream to generate a weekly report of all proposals created, sent, or closed in Proposify during the week. Use this data to create a report and automatically send it via email to stakeholders, using an app like SendGrid or Gmail for email dispatch. This workflow supports transparency and regular updates without manual intervention.
