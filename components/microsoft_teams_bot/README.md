# Overview

The Microsoft Teams Bot API allows developers to enhance the capabilities of Microsoft Teams through customized bots. These bots can interact with users, manage tasks, and integrate with various services, thereby automating routine operations and facilitating real-time collaboration. On Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create powerful workflows that trigger actions within Teams or connect Teams with other apps to streamline business processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Daily Standup Initiator**: A workflow that triggers a Microsoft Teams Bot to initiate daily standup meetings by sending a message to a designated channel. The bot can ask predefined questions and collect responses from team members, summarizing the input and posting it back to the channel or forwarding it to a project management tool like Trello or Asana.

- **Incident Alert Notifications**: Set up a Microsoft Teams Bot to automatically notify the relevant team channel when an incident is reported on platforms like PagerDuty or JIRA. This workflow can include extracting details from the incident report and formatting them into a concise message, ensuring quick awareness and response from the team.

- **Meeting Scheduler and Reminder**: Create a workflow where the Microsoft Teams Bot interacts with Google Calendar to schedule meetings based on team availability and project deadlines. The bot can send reminders to the team channel and individual participants prior to each meeting, ensuring everyone is prepared and on time.
