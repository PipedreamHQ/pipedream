# Example Use Cases

- **Real-time Stock Alert System**: Create a Pipedream workflow that uses the Finage API to monitor specific stock prices. When the price hits a predefined threshold, the workflow can trigger an alert via email, SMS, or a messaging platform like Slack. This helps you act swiftly on market changes.

- **Automated Currency Exchange Rate Analysis**: Use Pipedream to schedule a recurring workflow that fetches the latest currency exchange rates from Finage. The data can be processed and analyzed to identify trends, and results can be stored in Google Sheets or a database for further analysis or visualization.

- **Cryptocurrency Data Aggregator**: Build a workflow on Pipedream that collates real-time cryptocurrency data from Finage with additional information from other crypto-related APIs. This aggregated dataset can be sent to a data visualization tool like Power BI or Tableau for an in-depth market analysis.
