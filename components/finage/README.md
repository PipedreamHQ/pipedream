# Overview

The Finage API provides real-time, historical, and market data across stocks, currencies, and cryptocurrencies. Integrating Finage with Pipedream allows you to create workflows that react to market changes, automate trading analysis, and consolidate financial data for reporting. With Pipedream, you can tap into webhooks, schedules, and over 800+ apps for extensive automation possibilities, leveraging Finage's vast financial datasets.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-time Stock Alert System**: Create a Pipedream workflow that uses the Finage API to monitor specific stock prices. When the price hits a predefined threshold, the workflow can trigger an alert via email, SMS, or a messaging platform like Slack. This helps you act swiftly on market changes.

- **Automated Currency Exchange Rate Analysis**: Use Pipedream to schedule a recurring workflow that fetches the latest currency exchange rates from Finage. The data can be processed and analyzed to identify trends, and results can be stored in Google Sheets or a database for further analysis or visualization.

- **Cryptocurrency Data Aggregator**: Build a workflow on Pipedream that collates real-time cryptocurrency data from Finage with additional information from other crypto-related APIs. This aggregated dataset can be sent to a data visualization tool like Power BI or Tableau for an in-depth market analysis.
