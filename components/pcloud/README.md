# Overview

The pCloud API allows for direct interaction with your pCloud account, providing access to files and folders within your cloud storage. With Pipedream, you can automate file management tasks such as uploading, downloading, and synchronizing files. Additionally, you can create workflows to organize your cloud storage, share files with team members, or back up important data from various sources.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Backup from GitHub to pCloud**: Upon a new GitHub release, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that archives the repository and uploads the zip file to a designated pCloud folder. This ensures your codebase is backed up at every significant milestone.

- **Image Sync with Social Media**: When a new photo is posted to your Instagram account, Pipedream can automatically save a copy to a specific pCloud album. This workflow keeps a cloud backup of your social media imagery without manual intervention.

- **Receipt Collection from Email**: Pipedream can monitor your email inbox for messages containing receipts and save the attachments directly to a pCloud folder. This can be particularly useful for expense tracking and reporting.
