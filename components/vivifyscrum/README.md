# Overview

The VivifyScrum API unleashes the potential to automate your agile project management by interfacing with your scrum boards, backlogs, and work items. Through Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows that respond to events within VivifyScrum, such as new tasks or status updates. This allows for synchronization of project data across various platforms, reporting, and triggering actions in other tools, thereby enhancing productivity and providing real-time insights.

# Example Use Cases

**Automate Task Creation from Emails**: When you receive an email in Gmail with a specific subject or from a particular sender, use Pipedream to parse the email and automatically create a backlog item or task in VivifyScrum. This ensures that action items from emails are captured without manual entry.

**Sync Tasks with Calendar**: Integrate VivifyScrum with Google Calendar to add due dates from tasks as events. Whenever a due date is assigned or updated in VivifyScrum, it triggers a Pipedream workflow that creates or updates a corresponding event in Google Calendar, helping to keep track of deadlines visually.

**Slack Notifications for Board Updates**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for changes on VivifyScrum boards and sends a notification to a designated Slack channel. This keeps the team informed in real-time when tasks are moved across stages, completed, or when comments are added, fostering collaboration and immediate response to updates.
