# Overview

The PostGrid Verify API offers a precise method to validate and standardize postal addresses. By integrating with this API on Pipedream, you can automate the process of scrubbing address data within your apps, ensuring accuracy and deliverability. This could be critical for businesses that depend on reliable mailing operations, CRM data accuracy, or e-commerce checkout processes. Using Pipedream, you can create serverless workflows that respond to events, verify addresses on-the-fly, and connect with countless other services for enhanced data management.

# Example Use Cases

- **CRM Address Validation:** Automate the verification of new addresses as they are added to your CRM. When a contact is created or updated in Salesforce, trigger a workflow that uses PostGrid Verify to validate the address. If the address is invalid, update the CRM record with a flag or send an alert to the responsible account manager.

- **E-commerce Order Validation:** Improve your e-commerce platform's accuracy by validating shipping addresses during checkout. Set up a Pipedream workflow triggered by a new order in Shopify. Use PostGrid Verify to ensure the address is correct, reducing shipping errors, and potentially add corrected addresses back into the Shopify order details.

- **Bulk Address Cleanup:** Periodically clean up the addresses in your database. Trigger a Pipedream workflow on a schedule to pull addresses from a Google Sheets document, validate each one with PostGrid Verify, and then update the sheet with the validation results. This helps in maintaining a clean, organized, and deliverable address database.
