# Overview

The Tally API offers a suite of automation capabilities for Tally, a form-building platform that allows users to create forms without needing to code. Leveraging this API within Pipedream can supercharge your data collection and processing. With Pipedream, you can react to form submissions in real-time, sync data to other services, and customize your workflows to suit various use cases including data analysis, lead capture, and feedback management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Lead Capture to CRM**: Upon receiving a new form submission on Tally, trigger a workflow that automatically adds the respondent's details to your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. This keeps the sales team updated in real-time with fresh leads.

- **Dynamic Feedback Aggregation**: Configure a Pipedream workflow to collect form submissions from Tally and insert them into Google Sheets. Apply further logic to categorize and analyze the feedback for actionable insights, which can then be reported to decision-makers.

- **Event Registration and Confirmation**: Create an event registration form in Tally and set up a Pipedream workflow to send a personalized confirmation email via SendGrid to each registrant. Additionally, manage attendee lists and send reminders as the event date approaches.
