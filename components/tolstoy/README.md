# Overview

The Tolstoy API allows developers to integrate interactive video capabilities into their applications. With this API, users can create, manage, and track interactive video experiences that engage viewers through personalized paths based on viewer responses. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, one can automate workflows that connect Tolstoy with other apps to enhance marketing, customer support, and personalized user engagement through automated triggers and actions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Onboarding Videos**: Trigger a personalized onboarding video via Tolstoy when a new user signs up on your platform. Use Shopify or WooCommerce on Pipedream to initiate this workflow. After the signup, a welcome email can be sent with a link to a personalized Tolstoy video that guides them through product setup or usage.

- **Interactive Support Ticket Response**: Integrate Tolstoy with Zendesk or Intercom on Pipedream. When a support ticket is filed, automatically generate a Tolstoy interactive video that addresses Frequently Asked Questions or provides step-by-step troubleshooting guidance based on the specific issues mentioned in the ticket.

- **Event-Driven Product Demos**: Connect Tolstoy to Eventbrite or Meetup via Pipedream to trigger personalized product demos via video after someone registers for a webinar or event. The video can include interactive elements that tailor the demo based on the viewerâ€™s preferences or previous interactions with your product.
