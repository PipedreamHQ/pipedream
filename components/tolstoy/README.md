# Overview

The Tolstoy API offers a suite of tools for engaging with customers through interactive video experiences. With it, you can automate the creation, analysis, and management of interactive video content, streamlining how you engage with your audience. By leveraging the Tolstoy API on Pipedream, you can create powerful automations that react to video interactions, manage leads, and trigger personalized follow-ups based on viewer behavior. This supports a more dynamic and responsive marketing strategy, improves lead qualification processes, and enhances customer support by providing interactive video experiences tailored to user actions and feedback.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Lead Qualification and Follow-Up**: When a prospect completes a Tolstoy interactive video, Pipedream can capture their responses, qualify the lead based on pre-defined criteria, and automatically send personalized follow-up content via email through integration with an email marketing service such as Mailchimp.

- **Dynamic Video Content Distribution**: Create a workflow that monitors customer behavior on your platform. Based on specific actions, such as visiting a product page multiple times, Pipedream triggers a Tolstoy API call to send a personalized interactive video to the customer, providing them with additional product information or a special offer.

- **Real-Time Support Ticket Generation**: Implement a system where customer responses from a support-related Tolstoy video are sent to Pipedream, which then creates a support ticket in Zendesk or another customer service platform. This can include tagging the ticket based on the issues highlighted in the video interaction, ensuring the right support team member addresses the concern rapidly.
