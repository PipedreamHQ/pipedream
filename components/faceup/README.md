# Overview

FaceUp API allows developers to integrate whistleblowing features into their applications, empowering users to report unethical or illegal activities anonymously. This API supports creating, managing, and tracking reports securely, making it a valuable tool for organizations to maintain transparency and accountability.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Incident Reporting**: Use the FaceUp API on Pipedream to automatically create incident reports from various sources such as emails or web forms. Trigger workflows when a new report is submitted, analyze the content, and store details in a secure database like AWS S3 or Google Sheets for review.

- **Monitor and Alert**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to monitor new reports submitted through FaceUp. Use conditions to check the severity of reports and automatically send alerts via Slack, email, or SMS to the appropriate personnel for immediate action.

- **Aggregate and Analyze Feedback**: Collect and aggregate feedback via FaceUp, and continuously sync this data into a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. Analyze trends and patterns in reports to help identify areas within the organization that require attention or improvement.
