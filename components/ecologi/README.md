# Overview

The Ecologi API allows you to integrate with their platform to track and support climate projects. Through Pipedream, you can automate interactions with Ecologi, including retrieving your carbon offset data, funding climate projects, and planting trees. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows that trigger based on various events, process data, and connect with thousands of other apps to perform actions conditionally based on your sustainability goals.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Monthly Offset Report**: Generate and send a monthly report detailing your carbon offset contributions. This workflow could retrieve your offset data from Ecologi, compile it into a summary, and email it to stakeholders using a service like SendGrid or directly through SMTP.

- **E-commerce Carbon Neutral Orders**: Create a workflow that plants trees with Ecologi each time an order is placed on your e-commerce platform. For example, upon receiving a new order webhook from Shopify, the Pipedream workflow could calculate the required number of trees to offset the order's carbon footprint and use the Ecologi API to plant them.

- **Social Impact Public Reporting**: Automatically update a public dashboard with your latest Ecologi impact stats. Whenever you reach a new milestone in trees planted or carbon offset, Pipedream can trigger a workflow to update a Google Sheet or push the data to a Data Studio report, showcasing your company's commitment to the environment.
