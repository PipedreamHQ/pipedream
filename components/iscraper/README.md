# Overview

The iScraper API is a powerful tool for extracting information from Instagram, making it possible to gather rich data sets from user profiles, hashtags, and posts. When leveraged through Pipedream, iScraper can become a part of diverse workflows, automating the collection of social media insights and integrating them with other services for analysis, reporting, or social media management. With Pipedream, you can create event-driven workflows that react to new data from iScraper, orchestrate data flow across multiple services, and handle complex tasks without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases
