# Overview

SimpleBackups is a tool for automating the backup of databases and files to a cloud storage service. With its API, you can manage backups, retrieve backup information, and trigger backups programmatically. Using Pipedream, you can integrate SimpleBackups with a multitude of apps to create custom and powerful automated workflows. This can help streamline operations such as monitoring backup statuses, triggering backups based on specific events, and keeping teams informed about backup health.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Backup Triggers**: - Integrate SimpleBackups with a scheduling app on Pipedream to trigger database backups at the end of each business day. Automatically store these backups in a cloud storage solution like Amazon S3, and then use Pipedream to notify your team via Slack or email with the backup details.

- **Backup Monitoring and Alerts**: - Connect SimpleBackups to a monitoring tool on Pipedream to track backup completion or failures. Set up a workflow that sends real-time alerts to your preferred communication platform, such as Microsoft Teams, whenever a backup job completes successfully or encounters an issue.

- **Backup Reports and Dashboard Updates**: - Use Pipedream to create a workflow that periodically fetches the latest backup logs from SimpleBackups and compiles them into a report. This report can then be sent to a Google Sheets document, updating a live backup dashboard that your team can access for quick reference.
