# Overview

The Project Broadcast API facilitates communication through automated text messaging, providing features to manage contacts, send messages, and track campaigns. Leveraging this API on Pipedream allows you to create intricate workflows that can automate your texting campaigns, sync contact lists, and engage with customers by integrating with numerous other services for CRM, marketing, and other functions. With Pipedream's serverless platform, these integrations become seamless, triggering actions in real-time or on a schedule without the need for complex infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Follow-Up Messages**: Build a workflow that listens for new customer sign-ups from your website's API. When a new sign-up is detected, automatically add the customer's contact information to Project Broadcast and send a personalized welcome text message.

- **SMS Campaign Metrics to Google Sheets**: Create a workflow that triggers periodically to retrieve campaign performance metrics from Project Broadcast. Then, parse the data and append it to a Google Sheets document for easy tracking and visualization of campaign effectiveness.

- **Customer Feedback Collection**: Set up a workflow that sends a text message to customers after a purchase, asking for feedback. Use a webhook to collect responses, store them in a Pipedream data store, and then sync the data with your CRM, such as Salesforce, for further customer engagement strategies.
