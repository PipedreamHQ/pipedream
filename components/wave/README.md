# Overview

Wave is a financial software that simplifies accounting, invoicing, and receipt scanning for small businesses. With the Wave API, you can automate various financial tasks directly within Pipedream. You can create invoices, manage customers, process payments, and extract financial reports. Integrating Wave with Pipedream allows you to connect your accounting workflow with other apps, triggering actions based on financial events or scheduling regular financial operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Creation on New Customer Signup**: When a new customer registers via your app (e.g., using the Shopify API), automatically create and send a customized invoice in Wave.

- **Expense Tracking with Receipt Scanning**: Send an email with a receipt attachment (using the Gmail API) to a designated Pipedream inbox, which triggers a workflow that scans and records the receipt in Wave for expense tracking.

- **Monthly Financial Summary Reports**: Schedule a monthly Pipedream workflow to retrieve financial reports from Wave and send a digest via Slack to your finance team for review.
