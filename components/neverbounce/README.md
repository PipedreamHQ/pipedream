# Overview

Neverbounce is a nifty email verification tool that ensures your email lists are clean and your messages reach real people. By leveraging the Neverbounce API on Pipedream, you can automate the process of validating emails in real-time or in batches, directly within your workflows. This means you can maintain high deliverability rates, decrease bounce rates, and preserve your sender reputation without breaking a sweat.

# Example Use Cases

- **Email List Hygiene Automation**: Automatically clean email lists by connecting Neverbounce to a CRM like HubSpot. When a new contact is added, trigger a workflow that uses Neverbounce to validate the email address. If it's valid, update the contact in HubSpot; if not, flag it for review or removal.

- **Real-Time Signup Verification**: Integrate Neverbounce with your sign-up forms to validate email addresses as they're entered. Use Pipedream to create a workflow where each new entry triggers an email check. Upon verification, proceed with the signup process or prompt the user to provide a valid email.

- **Automated Outreach Quality Control**: Before sending out a marketing campaign using a platform like SendGrid, use Neverbounce within a Pipedream workflow to verify all recipient email addresses. This helps ensure your campaign reaches the intended audience and improves overall engagement metrics.
