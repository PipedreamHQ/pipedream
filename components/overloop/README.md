# Example Use Cases

- **Sales Lead Auto-Tagging**: Create a workflow that listens for new leads in Overloop and automatically tags them based on predefined criteria such as industry, company size, or location. Connect this with Slack to send notifications to corresponding sales reps instantly.

- **Email Sequence Triggering Based on Website Activity**: Design a workflow where Overloop triggers an email sequence when a lead visits certain pages on your website. Combine this with Google Analytics to refine follow-ups based on user engagement and page interactions.

- **Real-time CRM Synchronization**: Set up a real-time sync between Overloop and your CRM, such as Salesforce. Whenever a lead's status updates in Overloop, the workflow could update the corresponding record in Salesforce, ensuring that sales data remains consistent across both platforms.
