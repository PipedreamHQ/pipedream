# Overview

The CodeQR API enables you to create and manage dynamic QR Codes, shorten URLs, capture leads, and track engagement through powerful analytics. By integrating CodeQR with Pipedream, you can automate the generation of QR Codes and short links across a wide range of workflows — from marketing automation to customer support — and seamlessly connect these actions to over 2,500 apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Dynamic QR Code Generation for Marketing Campaigns**
  Automatically generate campaign-specific QR Codes when a new campaign is launched in your CRM or marketing tool. Store the QR code image in your cloud drive (e.g., Google Drive or Dropbox), and attach it to your newsletters or printed materials.

- **URL Shortening with Pre-Redirect Lead Capture**
  When a new record is added to Airtable or a Google Sheet with a destination URL, create a short link using CodeQR that optionally includes a lead capture page before redirection. Use this to qualify traffic before they reach your landing page.

- **Automated Feedback Collection**
  Trigger the creation of a QR code linked to a feedback form after each customer interaction in platforms like Zendesk, Intercom, or HubSpot. Easily track which customers scanned the code and filled the form, and centralize the responses.

- **Analytics Monitoring and Reporting**
  Use Pipedream workflows to pull scan and click analytics from CodeQR at regular intervals. Send the data to Slack, update a Google Sheet, or visualize trends on a custom dashboard.
