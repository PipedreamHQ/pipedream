# Overview

The Snyk API provides programmatic access to Snyk's vulnerability detection capabilities, enabling you to automate security analysis and monitor for security issues in your codebases, open-source dependencies, container images, and more. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to create automated, serverless workflows that integrate Snyk's security insights with your development and operations processes. With Pipedream's ability to connect to hundreds of apps, you can seamlessly integrate Snyk's data with other services like Slack for notifications, JIRA for issue tracking, or GitHub for code management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Vulnerability Alerts in Slack**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever Snyk identifies a new vulnerability in your project. The workflow can filter for high-severity issues and send a formatted alert to a designated Slack channel, keeping your team immediately informed.

- **JIRA Ticket Creation for Security Issues**: When Snyk finds security issues, use Pipedream to automatically create JIRA tickets, assigning them to the appropriate team members with all relevant details. This ensures that vulnerabilities are tracked and addressed according to your project's workflow.

- **Continuous Security Audits with Scheduled Workflows**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to periodically trigger Snyk scans on your repositories and monitor the security status of your projects. The results could then be logged in Google Sheets or sent via email, providing you with a regular security report.
