# Overview

The Retable API enables you to interact with your Retable data programmatically, allowing for seamless integration of your tables within your apps or workflows. With Pipedream, you can harness this capability to automate tasks, sync data across platforms, or trigger actions based on changes in your tables. Pipedreamâ€™s low-code platform provides the tools to create powerful serverless workflows using Retable API, without the need for extensive coding knowledge.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Backup**: Create a workflow that triggers at regular intervals to back up your Retable tables to a cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox. This ensures your data is safe and accessible from anywhere.

- **Real-time CRM Updates**: Connect Retable to a CRM platform such as HubSpot. Each time a new entry is added to a Retable table, trigger a workflow that creates or updates a contact in HubSpot, keeping your sales or customer support teams always in sync with the latest data.

- **Issue Tracking Integration**: For development teams using Retable to track issues, set up a workflow that integrates with GitHub or Jira. When an issue is updated or marked as resolved in Retable, automatically update the corresponding issue in GitHub or Jira, streamlining the project management process.
