# Overview

ProcFu is a versatile API that enhances the capabilities of Podio and GlobiFlow to streamline complex business processes. It offers advanced scripting and automation functionalities that go beyond the native capabilities of these platforms. On Pipedream, you can leverage ProcFu to automate workflows, manipulate data, and integrate with various services, maximizing efficiency and reducing manual overhead.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Customer Onboarding**: When a new deal is closed in a CRM like Salesforce (trigger), use ProcFu to create and set up projects in Podio automatically. Then, send personalized emails via SendGrid to welcome the new client, all orchestrated through Pipedream.

- **Inventory Management Sync**: Sync inventory levels between an eCommerce platform like Shopify and a Podio app. Whenever a sale is recorded on Shopify (trigger), use ProcFu to adjust the inventory count in Podio and send low stock alerts via Twilio SMS, ensuring inventory is always tracked and replenished timely.

- **Daily Business Reporting**: Generate daily business reports from data in Podio. Set a schedule on Pipedream to trigger ProcFu scripts that compile data into a report, then use Google Sheets API to format and save this report. Email the final document to stakeholders through Gmail for streamlined communication and updates.
