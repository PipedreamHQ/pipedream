# Overview

The Accredible API lets you automate the creation and management of digital certificates, badges, and blockchain credentials. Using Pipedream, you can connect the Accredible API to myriad services for streamlined workflow automation. Create digital certificates when a student completes a course, update credentials with new information, or share achievements across social platforms or via email. Pipedream's serverless platform enables you to integrate these actions with other apps, such as learning management systems, CRMs, and communication tools, without writing extensive code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Certificate Issuance after Course Completion**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow when a student finishes a course in a Learning Management System like Teachable or Thinkific. The workflow would then call the Accredible API to issue a certificate and email it directly to the student.

- **Bulk Update Credentials**: Use a webhook to listen for updates from your database or a Google Sheet. When data changes, the Pipedream workflow utilizes the Accredible API to update credentials in bulk, ensuring all information reflects the most current status.

- **Share Credentials on Social Media**: After a certificate is created, trigger a Pipedream workflow that posts a congratulatory message along with the credential link on the recipient's LinkedIn profile through the LinkedIn API, broadening the reach and recognition of their achievement.
