# Overview

Botstar API lets you extend the capabilities of Botstar's chatbot platform. It empowers you to programmatically manage and interact with your chatbots, access chat and user data, and integrate with external services. With Pipedream, you can leverage these API functions to automate workflows between Botstar and other apps, trigger actions based on chat events, or synchronize chatbot data with CRM platforms, databases, or marketing tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Automation**: Automate ticket creation in a helpdesk app like Zendesk whenever a Botstar chatbot identifies a support request. Use Pipedream to listen for specific keywords or intents in Botstar conversations, then create tickets in Zendesk with the relevant chat details, enhancing support response times.

- **E-commerce Order Alerts**: Whenever a new order is placed via a Botstar e-commerce chatbot, trigger a workflow that sends real-time notifications to a Slack channel. This keeps your sales team instantly informed about new orders, allows them to quickly respond to customer inquiries, and streamlines the order management process.

- **Feedback Collection and Analysis**: Integrate Botstar with Google Sheets or Airtable to collect user feedback from chatbot interactions. After a conversation ends, Pipedream can capture the feedback and store it in a spreadsheet or database. Combine this data with sentiment analysis tools to gain insights and improve chatbot performance.
