# Overview

The Cisco Webex API allows developers to integrate their applications with Cisco's robust collaboration tools, creating a workflow of communication within teams and automating various aspects of the meeting lifecycle, from scheduling to follow-up actions. With this API, you can streamline meeting setups, fetch detailed information about participants and meetings, send messages to spaces (rooms), and manage your Webex resources programmatically. Leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can connect these features with other apps to automate complex tasks, analyze meeting data, enhance productivity, and maintain a well-organized communication ecosystem.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Meeting Scheduling with Google Calendar**: When a new event is added to a Google Calendar, automatically schedule a corresponding Webex meeting and send invites to the participants. This ensures that all meetings have a virtual space without manual setup.

- **Post-Meeting Summary to Slack**: After a Webex meeting concludes, trigger a workflow to compile meeting notes, attendance, and action items, then post a summary to a designated Slack channel. This keeps the team informed and accountable for follow-up tasks.

- **Sync Meeting Recordings to Google Drive**: Once a Webex meeting is recorded, trigger a workflow to upload the recording to Google Drive. Set permissions for sharing within your organization, ensuring that team members can access the meeting content at any time.
