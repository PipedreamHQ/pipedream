# Overview

The Govee API enables you to interact with your Govee smart home devices. Through Pipedream, you can automate actions like adjusting lighting color and brightness, monitoring temperature and humidity levels, and creating alerts based on the state of your devices. With Pipedream's capability to join multiple APIs, these interactions can become intelligent responses to inputs from other sources, such as calendars, weather services, or IoT triggers.

# Example Use Cases

- **Smart Home Dashboard Integration**: Create a custom dashboard that displays the status of all Govee devices in your home. Use Pipedream to collect data from Govee API, such as the current color and brightness of lights, temperature, and humidity readings, then display this data in real-time on your dashboard app.

- **Weather-Responsive Lighting**: Adjust your Govee lights based on local weather conditions. Set up a Pipedream workflow that uses the Weather API to fetch the current weather, then change the lighting in your home to match the mood. For example, cooler, blue lights when it's raining or warm, yellow lights when it's sunny.

- **Calendar Event-Driven Scenes**: Sync your Govee lights with your Google Calendar events. A Pipedream workflow can monitor your calendar for specific event tags or keywords and then adjust your home lighting to a preset scene or color to remind you of upcoming appointments or to set the mood for an event.
