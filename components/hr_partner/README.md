# Overview

The HR Partner API provides a suite of tools to manage employee records, leave requests, recruitment processes, and more in a centralized HR system. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to create automated workflows that streamline HR tasks, sync data with other business systems, and trigger actions based on employee activities. The API enables you to programmatically interact with HR Partner's platform, allowing you to create, read, update, and delete various HR-related data points.

# Example Use Cases

- **Employee Onboarding Automation**: Automate the onboarding process by triggering a workflow when a new employee is added in HR Partner. The workflow can send welcome emails, create accounts in third-party services like Slack or Trello, and schedule introductory meetings in Google Calendar.

- **Leave Request Notification**: Set up a workflow that notifies managers or team members via Slack or email when an employee submits a leave request in HR Partner. The automation can include details of the leave request for quick review and action.

- **Recruitment Process Management**: Streamline the hiring process by automating candidate tracking. When a new candidate is added in HR Partner, trigger a Pipedream workflow to add the candidate's information to a Google Sheets spreadsheet, send task assignments to the hiring team, and schedule interviews in the team's calendars.
