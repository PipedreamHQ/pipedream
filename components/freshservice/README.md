# Overview

The Freshservice API opens up a realm of possibilities for streamlining IT service management processes. It allows you to interact programmatically with Freshservice features, such as creating tickets, managing users, updating service catalog items, and more. Leveraging the Freshservice API on Pipedream, you can automate repetitive tasks, create complex workflows that react to events in Freshservice in real time, and connect Freshservice to a multitude of other services to enhance its capabilities and your productivity.

# Example Use Cases

- **Ticket Management Automation**: Automate the creation, updating, and closing of tickets in Freshservice based on triggers from email, support forms, or chatbots. For instance, use Pipedream to listen for incoming emails through a platform like Gmail, parse the content, and automatically create tickets in Freshservice with the relevant details extracted from the email.

- **Asset Lifecycle Updates**: Keep asset records up-to-date by triggering workflows in Pipedream when changes occur in third-party asset management tools, such as Snipe-IT. When assets are added or updated in Snipe-IT, a Pipedream workflow can automatically reflect those changes in the Freshservice asset inventory, ensuring data consistency.

- **User Provisioning and Management**: Streamline user onboarding and offboarding by integrating Freshservice with HR platforms like BambooHR. When a new employee is added to BambooHR, a Pipedream workflow can create a new user in Freshservice, assign them to the correct groups, and even initiate the IT onboarding ticket sequence. Conversely, when an employee leaves, the workflow can deactivate their Freshservice account and kick off the offboarding process.
