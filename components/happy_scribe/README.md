# Overview

The Happy Scribe API provides tools for converting speech to text and vice versa, enabling developers to automate the transcription and subtitling of audio and video files. With the Happy Scribe integration on Pipedream, you can create workflows that trigger on various events, process content, and connect to other apps. Automate transcription jobs, sync transcripts to databases, notify teams when transcriptions are ready, or even analyze text for insights.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Podcast Transcription**: When a new podcast episode is uploaded to cloud storage (like S3 or Google Drive), trigger a Pipedream workflow that submits the audio file to Happy Scribe for transcription. Once the transcript is ready, the workflow can store it in a database and notify the team via Slack.

- **Video Subtitle Generation and Publishing**: For new videos added to a CMS or YouTube channel, trigger a Pipedream workflow to request subtitles from Happy Scribe. Then, the subtitles can be reviewed or automatically published as part of the video's metadata, enhancing SEO and accessibility.

- **Sentiment Analysis on Transcribed Meetings**: After a Zoom meeting ends, a Pipedream workflow can send the recording to Happy Scribe for transcription. Another action could then pass the transcript to a sentiment analysis service like MonkeyLearn to gauge the overall tone of the meeting, which could be valuable for HR and team management.
