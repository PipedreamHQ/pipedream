# Overview

The Microsoft To Do API on Pipedream allows you to seamlessly integrate your tasks and to-do lists with other services and automate your personal or team workflows. By harnessing this API, you can create, read, update, and delete tasks, manage lists, and sync with your calendar or mail. This opens up possibilities for automated task management, deadline reminders, or syncing across multiple platforms for enhanced productivity.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Tasks with Google Calendar:** Automatically create or update events in Google Calendar when a new task is added or modified in Microsoft To Do. This ensures that all your deadlines and to-dos are visible on your calendar, which helps keep you on top of your schedule.

- **Email Digest of Daily Tasks:** Design a workflow that sends you a daily email digest with your tasks for the day. This can be achieved by integrating Microsoft To Do with an email service like Gmail or SendGrid on Pipedream, providing a clear overview of your day's priorities directly in your inbox.

- **Task Creation from Slack Messages:** Set up a Pipedream workflow where you can create tasks in Microsoft To Do directly from Slack messages. Utilize a slash command or a message action in Slack to instantly turn a message into a to-do item, allowing for quick task capture while communicating with your team.
