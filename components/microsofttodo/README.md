# Overview

The Microsoft To Do API grants access to your tasks and to-do lists, enabling you to create, read, update, and delete task-related data programmatically. Integrating this API with Pipedream opens a pathway to automate task management in a multitude of ways. You can sync tasks across different platforms, set up custom notifications, or even manage tasks in bulk. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can build workflows that trigger on specific events and connect with numerous other services for a seamless task management experience.

## Example Use Cases

- **Sync Tasks with Google Calendar**
  Create a workflow on Pipedream that adds tasks from Microsoft To Do as events in Google Calendar. This way, you can visualize your to-do list alongside other scheduled events, ensuring important tasks don't get overlooked.

- **Task Completion Notifications**
  Set up a Pipedream workflow that sends a notification through an app like Slack or sends an SMS whenever you complete a task in Microsoft To Do. Keep your team updated or remind yourself of completed tasks for personal satisfaction and record-keeping.

- **Manage Tasks via Voice Commands**
  Build a Pipedream workflow that integrates with a voice assistant platform like Alexa or Google Assistant. With simple voice commands, you can add tasks to your Microsoft To Do list or check off completed tasks without having to type or open the app.
