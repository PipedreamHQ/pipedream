# Overview

Alegra API allows for the automation and integration of accounting and financial tasks within Alegra's software platform. Through the API, developers can create, read, update, and delete information related to invoices, clients, products, services, and more. Essentially, it's a way to streamline financial operations, ensure data accuracy, and free up time from manual data entry by connecting Alegra to other business tools and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Creation and Email Notification**: When a new sale is recorded in your e-commerce platform, Pipedream triggers a workflow that generates an invoice in Alegra and then sends an email notification to the customer with the invoice attached. This could be paired with Shopify or WooCommerce on Pipedream.

- **Sync Contacts Between CRM and Alegra**: Upon adding a new contact in your CRM, like Salesforce, a Pipedream workflow is triggered to create the same contact in Alegra, ensuring your customer data is consistent across all business systems. This avoids duplicate entries and keeps your accounting records up to date.

- **Expense Tracking and Reporting**: Connect Alegra to a receipt scanning app like Expensify using Pipedream. Each time an employee uploads a receipt, the workflow triggers an entry in Alegra's expense ledger, streamlining reimbursement processes and financial reporting.
