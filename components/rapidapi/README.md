# Overview

RapidAPI is a platform that lets you connect to thousands of APIs with ease. By using RapidAPI with Pipedream, you can create powerful serverless workflows that automate API interactions, streamline data processing, and integrate various services seamlessly. Imagine stitching together APIs for machine learning, data enrichment, communication, and more, without managing infrastructure. You can trigger workflows with HTTP requests, emails, or on a schedule, and process the data with built-in Pipedream steps or custom Node.js code.

# Example Use Cases
