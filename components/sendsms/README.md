# Overview

The sendSMS API provides a straightforward method to send text messages directly from Pipedream workflows. It can be a powerful tool for notifications, alerts, marketing campaigns, or any application where you need to deliver short, timely messages to users' mobile devices. With Pipedreamâ€™s ability to integrate myriad services and its serverless platform, you can construct workflows that trigger SMS messages based on events, schedule messages, or even send personalized updates to a list of recipients.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Order Updates**: Automate order status notifications by integrating sendSMS with an e-commerce platform like Shopify. When an order status changes to 'Shipped', trigger a workflow that sends a personalized SMS to the customer with their tracking information.

- **Website Downtime Alerts**: Pair sendSMS with uptime monitoring apps such as UptimeRobot. Set up a workflow that listens for website downtime alerts and dispatches an SMS to your tech team, ensuring immediate attention to outages.

- **Event Reminder Service**: Create a workflow that connects sendSMS with Google Calendar. When a calendar event is approaching, the workflow sends a reminder SMS to participants with the event details, ensuring better attendance and preparedness.
