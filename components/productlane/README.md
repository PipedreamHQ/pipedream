# Overview

The Productlane API on Pipedream allows you to integrate and automate your product feedback loop. You can craft workflows to manage feature requests, prioritize product development, and engage with your user base more effectively. It's useful for product managers who want to streamline user feedback into actionable insights, and for development teams aiming to align their work with customer needs.

# Example Use Cases

- **Syncing Feature Requests to Project Management Tools**: Automatically create tasks in project management apps like Trello or Asana when new feature requests are submitted via Productlane.

- **User Feedback Aggregation**: Gather and sort user feedback from Productlane, sending a daily or weekly digest to your team's Slack channel or email to keep everyone in the loop.

- **Feature Launch Announcements**: When a feature moves to 'launched' status in Productlane, trigger a workflow to announce the update across multiple platforms, such as Twitter, company blog, or newsletter.
