# Overview

The EchtPost Postcards API allows you to programmatically send real, physical postcards. With Pipedream's capabilities, you can automate the sending of these postcards in response to various triggers or events. Imagine crafting personalized thank you notes to customers, sending holiday greetings, or running a postcard marketing campaign completely automated with Pipedream's serverless platform.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Appreciation Postcards**: After a customer makes a purchase on your e-commerce platform, Pipedream listens for the purchase event, then uses the EchtPost Postcards API to send a thank you postcard to the customer's provided address.

- **Event Reminder Postcards**: Pipedream schedules and sends reminders for upcoming events. A week before an event stored in your Google Calendar, Pipedream triggers a workflow that uses the EchtPost Postcards API to mail out reminder postcards to all the attendees who have RSVPâ€™d.

- **Local Weather Updates**: Combine the OpenWeatherMap API with the EchtPost Postcards API on Pipedream to send postcards with weekly weather forecasts. Pipedream can pull weather data for different regions and automatically send postcards to residents with the upcoming weather summary.
