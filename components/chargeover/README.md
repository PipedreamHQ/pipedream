# Overview

ChargeOver is an API that simplifies the billing and invoicing process for SaaS and subscription-based services. With ChargeOver, you can automate billing workflows, handle various payment methods, set up recurring billing schedules, and manage customer information seamlessly. By integrating ChargeOver with Pipedream, you unlock the ability to craft custom automation flows that link billing events to countless other applications, enhance data management, and streamline communication with customers. It's ideal for businesses looking to reduce manual overhead and ensure their billing operations are as efficient as possible.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Dunning Management Workflow**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow when a payment fails in ChargeOver. The workflow can automatically send a tailored email to the customer with a link to update their payment method, log the failed payment in a Google Sheet for tracking, and alert your support team in Slack.

- **New Customer Onboarding Sequence**: When a new customer is added in ChargeOver, initiate a Pipedream workflow that creates a new customer record in your CRM (like Salesforce), enrolls the customer in an onboarding email sequence in a marketing tool like Mailchimp, and posts a welcome message with customer details in a private Slack channel for the sales team.

- **Subscription Upgrade Analytics**: Configure a workflow to be triggered by subscription changes in ChargeOver. When a customer upgrades their plan, the workflow can update the subscription details in a database, increment a metric in a business analytics tool like Google Analytics, and send a congratulatory email to the customer, leveraging SendGrid or a similar email delivery service.
