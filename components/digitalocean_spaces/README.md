# Overview

DigitalOcean Spaces API permits you to manage object storage, allowing for the storage and serving of massive amounts of data. This API is great for backing up, archiving, and providing public access to data or assets. On Pipedream, you can use this API to automate file operations like uploads, downloads, and deletions, as well as manage permissions and metadata. You can integrate it with other services for end-to-end workflow automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Backup to DigitalOcean Spaces**: Trigger a workflow on a schedule to back up important files from your server to a Space, ensuring data is always safe and versioned.

- **Media File Processing and Storage**: When a new image or video is uploaded to a Space, trigger a workflow that utilizes a service like AWS Lambda to process the media then update the metadata in the Space.

- **Static Website Content Deployment**: Upon pushing new content to a GitHub repository, automatically deploy the changes to your DigitalOcean Space where your static site content is hosted for seamless updates.
