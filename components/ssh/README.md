# Overview

The Secure Shell (SSH) API is an powerful tool for securely connecting to remote systems over a network, allowing users to easily and securely access their systems or services. This API is useful for a variety of tasks including data transfer and remote system management.

Key-based authentication is a way of validating the identity of the client to the server. It works by generating and exchanging a digital key that must match in order for the user to access the server. This provides an extra layer of security, as it is much harder to guess a digital key than a user password.

With the SSH (key-based auth) API, you can use key-based authentication to create an encrypted, authenticated channel between two computers. This can be used for securely accessing services, such as:

- Securing server access
- Sharing data with other systems
- Managing remote systems
- Transferring large files between computers
- Encrypting communication between two computers
