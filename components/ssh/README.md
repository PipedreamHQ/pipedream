# Overview

The SSH (Secure Shell) key-based authentication API allows you to execute commands on a remote server securely. With Pipedream, leverage this capability to automate server management tasks, execute deployment scripts, or gather data from your server infrastructure. By integrating with other apps on Pipedream, you can create seamless workflows that trigger actions on your servers in response to various events.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Deployment**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream when your code repository (like GitHub) senses a new commit to the master branch. The workflow would initiate an SSH session to your production server and pull the latest code changes, ensuring continuous deployment without manual intervention.

- **Scheduled Server Maintenance**: Set up a scheduled workflow in Pipedream that SSHs into your server to perform routine maintenance such as package updates, cleaning temp directories, or backing up databases. This could be paired with a notification service like Slack to inform your team when maintenance tasks have been completed.

- **Real-time Server Monitoring and Alerts**: Create a Pipedream workflow that periodically SSHs into your server to check system health, like disk space or running services. If it detects an issue, it could send an alert through an app like PagerDuty or send a detailed report to an email via SendGrid, enabling prompt response to potential problems.
