# Overview

The Firmao API allows for the integration of Firmao's CRM and ERP features into Pipedream's serverless platform, enabling the automation of tasks such as managing contacts, projects, tasks, invoices, and timesheets. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, users can create custom workflows that respond to events in Firmao, or orchestrate actions between Firmao and other apps to streamline business processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Contacts to a Google Sheet**: Whenever a new contact is added in Firmao, this workflow automatically adds the contact's details to a specified Google Sheet. This helps in maintaining an updated backup and easy sharing with team members who prefer working within spreadsheets.

- **Send Slack Notifications for New Invoices**: Create a workflow that listens for new invoices created in Firmao and sends a notification with invoice details to a Slack channel. This keeps the finance team or the entire company informed about billing activities in real-time.

- **Automate Project Creation from GitHub Issues**: When a new GitHub issue is tagged with a specific label, trigger a workflow that creates a corresponding project or task in Firmao. This bridges the gap between development tracking in GitHub and project management within Firmao.
