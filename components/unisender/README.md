# Overview

UniSender is a platform that empowers users to execute email and SMS marketing campaigns effectively. With the UniSender API on Pipedream, you can automate the process of managing contacts, designing emails, initiating campaigns, and analyzing the results. Implementing workflows that respond to subscriber actions, synchronize customer data across platforms, or dynamically update marketing lists becomes straightforward, enhancing the efficiency and personalization of your marketing efforts.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Lead Follow-Up**: After a lead is captured through a form on your website, trigger a workflow that automatically adds the contact to UniSender, sends a personalized welcome email, and follows up with a series of tailored SMS messages to keep your brand top-of-mind.

- **Dynamic List Segmentation**: Connect UniSender with your CRM (like Salesforce) to automate the segmentation process. When a contact's status updates in your CRM, a Pipedream workflow adjusts their corresponding UniSender mailing list membership to ensure they receive the most relevant content.

- **Campaign Performance Dashboard**: After sending out an email campaign via UniSender, trigger a workflow that fetches campaign analytics and pushes this data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This can be used for real-time monitoring of campaign performance metrics, helping to make data-driven decisions for future campaigns.
