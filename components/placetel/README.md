# Overview

The Placetel API lets you integrate a variety of telephony functions directly into Pipedream workflows. By connecting Placetel to Pipedream, you can automate processes like sending SMS messages, managing calls, or updating contact information programmatically. Pipedream's serverless platform enables these integrations to run on triggers such as incoming webhooks, scheduled times, or actions from other apps, orchestrating complex tasks in a simplified manner.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support Ticket Creation**: When a call is missed or a voicemail is received on Placetel, trigger a workflow in Pipedream to create a support ticket in a tool like Zendesk. This ensures that every customer query is logged and assigned to a support agent promptly.

- **SMS Notification for Calendar Events**: Link Placetel with Google Calendar in Pipedream. When an event is starting soon, automatically send an SMS reminder to the attendees using the Placetel API, ensuring everyone is on time.

- **Sync Contacts Between CRM and Placetel**: Maintain a consistent contact list by building a workflow that syncs new contacts from a CRM platform like Salesforce to Placetel. Each time a contact is added to Salesforce, add that contact to Placetel, keeping your communication channels up to date.
