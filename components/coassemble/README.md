# Overview

Coassemble is a user-friendly training and development platform that lets you create and deliver online courses. The Coassemble API enables the automation of various eLearning tasks, such as user management, course enrollment, and tracking course progress. By leveraging this API within Pipedream, you can streamline educational operations, synchronize educational data with other systems, and create dynamic learning experiences by triggering actions based on course activities.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated User Onboarding Workflow**: When a new employee is added to your HR system, use Pipedream to automatically create a user account in Coassemble and enroll them in relevant training courses.

- **Course Completion Certification**: Set up a workflow that listens for a course completion event in Coassemble and then generates a personalized certificate using a document generation service like DocuSign or PDF.co.

- **Synchronize Course Data with a CRM**: Keep your CRM, like Salesforce, updated by using Pipedream to monitor course progress and completion in Coassemble and then reflect these updates in the user's CRM record.
