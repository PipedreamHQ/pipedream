# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Lead Syncing with CRM**: Whenever a new lead is added to Adversus, the workflow automatically syncs this lead to your chosen CRM, such as Salesforce or HubSpot. It ensures that any updates made by the sales team in Adversus reflect in the CRM, keeping both systems in harmony and up-to-date.

- **Real-Time Notification for High-Value Deals**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for successful deal closures in Adversus. When a high-value deal is closed, it triggers a notification in Slack or sends an email to the management team, so they can take immediate congratulatory or follow-up action.

- **Performance Analytics Reporting**: Implement a workflow that periodically retrieves call logs and performance metrics from Adversus. The data is then processed and pushed to a Google Sheets document or a visualization tool like Tableau, providing accessible insights to the sales team for performance review and strategic planning.
