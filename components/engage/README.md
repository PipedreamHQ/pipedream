# Overview

The Engage API lets you automate and streamline your customer communication by sending personalized messages. With this API, you can craft interactions based on user behavior, preferences, and feedback. On Pipedream, you can integrate Engage with your workflow to trigger actions based on events from other apps, manage contact lists, and analyze communication patterns â€” all in real-time and without managing servers.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Feedback Collection Workflow**: After a customer interaction with your service, use the Engage API to send a personalized feedback request. Combine this with a Google Sheets integration on Pipedream to record and analyze responses for quality assurance.

- **User Onboarding Sequence**: Trigger an onboarding message sequence when a new user signs up for your service. Use Pipedream to listen for a new user event from your authentication service (like Auth0), and kick off a series of targeted messages via Engage to guide them through your platform's features.

- **Abandoned Cart Reminder**: Connect Engage to an e-commerce platform like Shopify with Pipedream. When a cart is abandoned, send a reminder message to the potential customer, offering assistance or a promotional code to encourage purchase completion.
