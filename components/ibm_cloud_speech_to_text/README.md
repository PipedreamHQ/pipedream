# Overview

The IBM Cloud - Speech to Text API transforms spoken language into written text, offering a powerful tool for creating transcriptions, enabling voice control and command features, and feeding speech into analytics platforms. With Pipedream, you can build automated workflows that leverage this capability, such as transcribing meetings in real-time, analyzing customer service calls for sentiment and keywords, or even creating subtitles for videos. The ability to connect with other apps on Pipedream allows for complex workflows that can turn spoken data into actionable insights or accessible content.
