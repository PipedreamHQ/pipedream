# Overview

The McTime API provides functionality for tracking and managing time-related data. With McTime integrated into Pipedream, you can automate processes involving employee scheduling, time tracking, and payroll. Leverage Pipedream's ability to connect with hundreds of apps to link time data with project management tools, accounting software, and communication platforms, streamlining workflow efficiencies and reducing manual timekeeping errors.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Payroll Processing**: Combine McTime with a payroll service like Gusto via Pipedream. Every time a new timesheet is approved in McTime, trigger a workflow that calculates pay and initiates a payroll run in Gusto, ensuring timely and accurate payment.

- **Shift Scheduling Notifications**: Link McTime to a communication app like Slack. When a new shift is scheduled or changed in McTime, automatically send a notification to the relevant Slack channel or direct message to the employee, keeping everyone informed in real time.

- **Project Time Tracking**: Integrate McTime with project management tools like Trello or Asana. After logging time in McTime for a project, a Pipedream workflow can update the corresponding task in Trello or Asana with time spent, improving project tracking and resource allocation.
