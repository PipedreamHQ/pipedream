# Overview

The McTime API provides functionality for tracking and managing time-related data. With McTime integrated into Pipedream, you can automate processes involving employee scheduling, time tracking, and payroll. Leverage Pipedream's ability to connect with 3,000+ apps to link time data with project management tools, accounting software, and communication platforms, streamlining workflow efficiencies and reducing manual timekeeping errors.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Payroll Processing**: Combine McTime with a payroll service like Gusto via Pipedream. Every time a new timesheet is approved in McTime, trigger a workflow that calculates pay and initiates a payroll run in Gusto, ensuring timely and accurate payment.

- **Shift Scheduling Notifications**: Link McTime to a communication app like Slack. When a new shift is scheduled or changed in McTime, automatically send a notification to the relevant Slack channel or direct message to the employee, keeping everyone informed in real time.

- **Project Time Tracking**: Integrate McTime with project management tools like Trello or Asana. After logging time in McTime for a project, a Pipedream workflow can update the corresponding task in Trello or Asana with time spent, improving project tracking and resource allocation.
