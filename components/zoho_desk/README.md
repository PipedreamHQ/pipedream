# Overview

Zoho Desk API empowers you to streamline and automate customer service processes. With Pipedream, you can tap into Zoho Desk's capabilities to manage tickets, fetch customer info, and coordinate your support team's efforts. Imagine syncing support tickets to your internal systems, triggering alerts for high-priority issues, or even analyzing support trends over time. Pipedream's serverless platform lets you connect Zoho Desk to hundreds of other apps with minimal hassle, transforming how you attend to customer needs.

# Example Use Cases

**Automated Ticket Prioritization Workflow**
Automatically prioritize incoming Zoho Desk tickets based on keywords, customer tier, or issue severity. Use Pipedream to route high-priority tickets to senior support agents and tag them for immediate attention, while grouping lower priority issues for batch processing. This can ensure a quicker response time for critical issues.

**Customer Satisfaction Follow-up**
After a ticket is marked as resolved in Zoho Desk, trigger an automated follow-up email or survey to gauge customer satisfaction. Pipedream can integrate Zoho Desk with email platforms like SendGrid or survey tools like Typeform to help maintain high levels of customer service and gather feedback for continuous improvement.

**Support Dashboard Sync**
Sync Zoho Desk data to a business intelligence tool like Google Data Studio to visualize customer support performance. With Pipedream, you can set up a workflow that periodically extracts ticket metrics and pushes them to your dashboard, providing your team with real-time insights into support operations and customer satisfaction trends.

# Troubleshooting

**Issues Connecting My Account: IP Allowlist**

If your Zoho security policy includes an IP Allowlist, update it to connect your account:

1. Add this IP Range: `44.223.89.56` - `44.223.89.63`.
2. Include your current IP Address because the initial OAuth authorization request originates from your browser.
3. Set up a [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/vpc#create-a-new-vpc). Add the [static IP address](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/vpc#find-the-static-outbound-ip-address-for-a-vpc) to Zoho's IP Allowlist. Note: VPCs are available with Pipedream's **Business Plan** or higher. See [pricing](https://pipedream.com/pricing) for details.

After connecting your account, make sure to [run the workflow within a VPC](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/vpc#run-workflows-within-a-vpc).
