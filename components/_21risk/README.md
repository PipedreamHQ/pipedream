# Overview

The 21RISK API provides functionalities to manage and monitor risk within organizations. Leveraging Pipedream's integration capabilities allows for automated workflows that can streamline risk management processes, trigger alerts, and synchronize risk data across various business tools. This API is particularly useful for organizations looking to automate their risk assessment and mitigation strategies effectively.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Risk Reporting**: Set up a workflow where risk assessment data from 21RISK is automatically fetched and compiled into a report format. This report can then be emailed weekly to stakeholders using the Gmail app on Pipedream.

- **Risk Change Alerts**: Create a workflow that monitors for any updates or changes in the risk status within 21RISK. If a risk level changes to a critical status, use Twilio's SMS service on Pipedream to send an immediate alert to relevant team members.

- **Compliance Check Automation**: Develop a workflow that integrates 21RISK with a compliance tracking app. Automatically fetch the latest risk data and use it to verify compliance with internal or external standards, flagging non-compliant items for review.
