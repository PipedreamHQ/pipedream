# Example Use Cases

  Create a workflow that identifies inactive prospects and automates re-engagement. Use the Outreach API to fetch prospects who haven't responded to previous emails, and trigger a personalized follow-up sequence via Pipedream. Integrate with a service like SendGrid to monitor email deliverability and open rates.

- **Automated Sales Reporting**
