# Overview

The Scalr API enables programmatic interaction with Scalr's infrastructure management and automation capabilities. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to create diverse workflows that automate cloud resource provisioning, management, and monitoring. These workflows can trigger on various events and integrate with other services to streamline your DevOps processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Resource Scaling**: Create a workflow that listens for webhooks signaling high traffic on your site. Use the Scalr API to automatically scale up your cloud infrastructure and handle the load, then scale down when traffic normalizes.

- **Compliance Monitoring**: Set up a scheduled workflow that checks the state of your infrastructure against compliance rules. If it finds any discrepancies, the workflow can alert your team via Slack or email and even create a ticket in Jira.

- **Infrastructure Deployment from Git Push**: Trigger a workflow on a git push event to a specific branch in GitHub. The workflow uses the Scalr API to deploy the latest version of your application on your cloud infrastructure, ensuring continuous deployment with minimal manual intervention.
