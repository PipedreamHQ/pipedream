# Overview

Payhere, powered by Xendit, offers a powerful API that allows you to craft seamless payment experiences within your apps and websites. By leveraging this API on Pipedream, you can automate payment processing, synchronize transaction data with accounting systems, or trigger communication based on payment events. Pipedream's serverless platform enables the orchestration of Payhere with an array of other services to streamline financial operations, enhance customer engagement, and maintain robust financial records.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Receipt Generation**: When a payment is successfully processed via Payhere, trigger a workflow on Pipedream to generate a digital receipt using a service like PDF.co. The workflow can then email the receipt to the customer automatically using an email service like SendGrid.

- **Real-Time Sales Dashboard Update**: Create a Pipedream workflow that listens for new transactions from Payhere and updates a real-time dashboard on Google Sheets or Geckoboard. This allows for instantaneous monitoring of sales data, which can be particularly useful for flash sales or promotions.

- **Customer Support Ticket Creation**: Use Pipedream to detect failed or disputed transactions from Payhere, automatically creating a support ticket in a customer service platform like Zendesk or Freshdesk. This workflow can help prioritize and streamline customer support responses to payment issues.
