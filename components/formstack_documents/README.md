# Overview

The Formstack Documents API gives you the power to automate document creation and delivery, making it simple to generate custom PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and more, from your data. By leveraging the API within Pipedream, you can integrate dynamic document generation into your workflows. You might merge data from various sources, populate templates with real-time data, and send documents directly to customers or team members.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Contract Generation from CRM Updates**: When a CRM like Salesforce updates a deal to 'Closed Won,' trigger a workflow in Pipedream to populate a contract template in Formstack Documents with the deal details. Then, email the contract to the customer for signature.

- **Dynamic Invoicing for E-commerce Orders**: Upon an order completion in an e-commerce platform such as Shopify, use Pipedream to capture the order details and create a tailored invoice using Formstack Documents. The invoice can then be emailed to the customer or saved to cloud storage like Google Drive.

- **Custom Report Generation from Database Entries**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow with new or updated records from a database app like Airtable. Use the Formstack Documents API to fill in a report template with the latest data, and then send the report to a Slack channel for team updates.
