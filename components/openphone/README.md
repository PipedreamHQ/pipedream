# Overview

The OpenPhone API integrates with Pipedream to automate actions within your OpenPhone account, syncing with other tools to streamline communications and operational processes. This API allows you to manage contacts, SMS, and call logs programmatically, providing a robust interface for creating custom phone system integrations that help in enhancing business communication workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Ticket Creation**: Automatically create a support ticket in Zendesk when receiving a text message on OpenPhone. This can be set to trigger based on specific keywords or from certain numbers, ensuring important customer communications are logged and addressed promptly.

- **SMS Notifications for Calendar Events**: Integrate OpenPhone with Google Calendar to send SMS reminders for upcoming appointments. This workflow can fetch upcoming events in your calendar and use OpenPhone to send timely reminders to participants, ensuring better meeting attendance.

- **Sync New Contacts to CRM**: Whenever a new contact is added in OpenPhone, automatically sync this information to a CRM like Salesforce. This keeps your contact list up-to-date across platforms, improving lead management and sales processes.
