# Overview

The WhatsApp Business API on Pipedream is a powerful avenue for automating interactions with customers on WhatsApp. You can send messages, set up automated responses, and manage conversations on a large scale. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows that trigger from various events and connect WhatsApp Business with numerous other apps to automate tasks, notify teams, sync data, and more, all without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Automation**: Automatically respond to common customer inquiries received on WhatsApp by integrating with a knowledge base or FAQ data store. This can cut down on response time and free up human agents for more complex queries.

- **Order Confirmation and Updates**: Send automated order confirmations and delivery status updates to customers. This could integrate with your e-commerce platform, like Shopify, to pull in real-time order information and send timely messages directly through WhatsApp.

- **Event Reminder Notifications**: Sync with a calendar service like Google Calendar to send reminders for appointments or events. When a calendar event is nearing, trigger a WhatsApp message to ensure the participant has all the necessary details.
