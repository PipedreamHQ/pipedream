# Overview

The Deel API offers a set of endpoints to automate and integrate contractor payments and compliance management within your business processes.

Pipedream's serverless platform allows you to trigger workflows from various events, facilitating real-time data synchronization and task automation without maintaining infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Compliance Alerting**: Monitor changes in compliance status for your contracts in Deel, and use Pipedream to send alerts through Slack or email. This helps you stay on top of any compliance issues and take immediate action.

- **Expense Tracking Integration**: Integrate Deel with your expense tracking system. Whenever a contractor submits an expense on Deel, trigger a workflow in Pipedream to log the expense in your bookkeeping software, like QuickBooks, ensuring accurate and up-to-date financial records.
