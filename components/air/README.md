# Overview

The Air API allows you to interact programmatically with Air's digital asset management platform, enabling automation of media and content operations. With Air, you can upload, organize, search, and share multimedia content like images, videos, and documents. Leveraging Air API on Pipedream, you can create powerful automations that connect your digital asset management with other business tools, streamline media workflows, enforce content governance, or enhance collaboration across teams.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Backup**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream that automatically backs up new media files uploaded to Air to other storage solutions like Google Drive or Dropbox. This ensures redundancy and secure storage of valuable media assets.

- **Content Approval and Notification System**: Create a workflow where once new content is added to Air, stakeholders receive notifications via Slack or email. They can review and approve directly through these platforms, and their responses can trigger the content's status update in Air.

- **Event-Driven Social Media Publishing**: Integrate Air with social media platforms like Twitter or Instagram via Pipedream. When specific assets are tagged as 'ready for publishing' in Air, they are automatically posted to connected social media accounts, streamlining the process of content distribution.
