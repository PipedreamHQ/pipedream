# Overview

The Nozbe Teams API enables automation of task and project management within the Nozbe Teams app. With this API on Pipedream, you can create, read, update, and delete tasks, projects, and comments, as well as manage team members and their activities. By tapping into this functionality, teams can streamline their workflows, synchronize project activities with other business tools, and enhance overall productivity with custom automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Task Management Sync**: Sync tasks between Nozbe Teams and Google Calendar. When a new task is added to a specific project on Nozbe Teams, create an event in Google Calendar with the due date and details. This ensures that deadlines are visible across all platforms used by team members.

- **Project Activity Digest**: Generate a daily or weekly digest of project activity. Using the Nozbe Teams API, aggregate the completed tasks and comments within a specified period, and send this summary through email using the SendGrid app on Pipedream. Team leaders can stay informed of project progress without having to manually check each project on Nozbe Teams.

- **Slack Task Notifications**: Integrate Nozbe Teams with Slack for real-time task updates. When a task is marked as completed in Nozbe Teams, send a notification to a designated Slack channel. This keeps the whole team updated on task completions and reinforces a culture of recognition and transparency in task management.
