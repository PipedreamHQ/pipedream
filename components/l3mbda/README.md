# Overview

The l3mbda API provides a platform to run JavaScript functions in the cloud, allowing you to execute code without setting up servers. On Pipedream, you can leverage the l3mbda API to create dynamic, serverless workflows. This enables you to run custom JavaScript functions as part of an automated process, integrate with other APIs, manipulate data, and respond to webhooks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Use l3mbda to run custom algorithms that generate personalized content, then pipe the output to a service like SendGrid to craft tailored email campaigns within Pipedream.

- **Data Processing and Enrichment**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow with a webhook, process the incoming data with l3mbda's custom JavaScript functions, enrich it with third-party APIs like Clearbit for additional insights, and store the results in a Google Sheet.

- **Automated Moderation Tool**: Create a Pipedream workflow that listens for new user-submitted content from platforms like Slack or Discord, run it through l3mbda to filter out inappropriate material using custom logic, and then post the approved content back to the platform or alert admins for manual review.
