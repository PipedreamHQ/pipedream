# Overview

The Pdfless API provides a suite of tools for creating and manipulating PDF documents, enabling users to generate PDFs from HTML, merge multiple PDFs into one, split a PDF into separate files, and convert PDFs to other formats. By incorporating the Pdfless API into Pipedream workflows, you can automate document processing tasks, streamline data extraction, and integrate with other services to manage documents as part of larger business processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Generate Invoices from E-commerce Orders**: Automate the creation of invoices by triggering a workflow whenever a new order is placed in an e-commerce platform like Shopify. Use Pdfless to convert HTML invoice templates into PDFs, populated with order details fetched from Shopify, and then email the invoice directly to the customer.

- **Merge Monthly Reports into a Single PDF**: Collect monthly reports from various sources like Google Sheets or Dropbox. Use Pdfless to combine these individual documents into a single PDF file, which can then be stored back in Dropbox or sent via email to stakeholders for review.

- **Convert Submitted Forms to Editable Formats**: When users submit forms through a web service like Typeform, trigger a Pipedream workflow to process the data. Leverage Pdfless to convert the submitted information into a PDF, and then to a format like DOCX, making it easy for team members to review and edit the content as needed.
