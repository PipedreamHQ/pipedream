# Overview

The Alchemy API provides a robust platform for sending and managing faxes programmatically, giving you the power to integrate fax capabilities into automated workflows. With Pipedream, you can tap into these capabilities to build event-driven serverless workflows. Automate the sending of faxes when certain triggers occur, receive status updates, and connect with countless other services to streamline document management, notifications, and data synchronization tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Delivery**: When a new invoice is generated in your accounting software, Pipedream can trigger an Alchemy API action to send the invoice as a fax to the customer. This ensures that billing communication is delivered promptly without manual intervention.

- **Order Confirmation Receipts**: Integrate Alchemy with an e-commerce platform via Pipedream. Every time an order is placed, automatically fax the order confirmation to the supplier or manufacturer, speeding up the fulfillment process.

- **Healthcare Appointment Reminders**: Connect Alchemy with a healthcare app to fax appointment reminders to patients. Use Pipedream to schedule and send personalized faxes a day before their appointment, improving attendance rates and patient engagement.
