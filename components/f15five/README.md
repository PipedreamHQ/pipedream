# Overview

The 15Five API enables you to build custom integrations and applications on top of the 15Five platform. With the API, you can access data stored in 15Five, including:

- Users
- Companies
- Goals
- Check-ins
- Feedback
- Recognition

You can use the API to build applications that help 15Five users manage their work and achieve their goals. For example, you could build a custom integration that links 15Five with another tool that your team uses, such as a project management tool or a CRM. Or, you could build a custom application that helps users track their progress on their goals, or provides them with recognition for a job well done.

 Whatever you build, the 15Five API gives you the power to customize the 15Five experience for your users in a way that best meets their needs.
