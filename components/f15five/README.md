# Overview

The 15Five API enables you to build custom integrations and applications on top
of the 15Five platform. With the API, you can access data stored in 15Five,
including:

- Users
- Companies
- Goals
- Check-ins
- Feedback
- Recognition

You can use the API to build applications that help 15Five users manage their
work and achieve their goals. For example, you could build a custom integration
that links 15Five with another tool that your team uses, such as a project
management tool or a CRM. Or, you could build a custom application that helps
users track their progress on their goals, or provides them with recognition
for a job well done.

 Whatever you build, the 15Five API gives you the power to customize the 15Five
 experience for your users in a way that best meets their needs.
