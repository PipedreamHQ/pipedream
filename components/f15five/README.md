# Overview

The 15Five API grants access to a performance management platform designed to help employees grow and achieve their goals. With Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate feedback collection, synchronize performance data across various systems, and trigger actions based on employee responses. By interconnecting 15Five with other apps, you can streamline HR processes, enhance employee engagement strategies, and maintain a pulse on organizational health.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Feedback Aggregation**: Collect weekly check-in data from 15Five and compile it into a centralized reporting tool like Google Sheets. This could help managers track progress over time and prepare for one-on-one meetings with direct reports.

- **Employee Recognition System**: Trigger a recognition workflow whenever an employee receives a high score on their 15Five review. This could be tied to a rewards platform like Bonusly, automatically granting points or accolades to the employee.

- **Performance Alert System**: Set up a monitoring system that notifies team leads or HR when an employee's 15Five responses indicate potential burnout or disengagement. This would allow quick intervention and support, linked to communication platforms like Slack or email.
