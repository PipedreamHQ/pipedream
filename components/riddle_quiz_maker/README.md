# Example Use Cases

- **Content Engagement Trigger for Email Campaigns**: When a user completes a quiz, you could trigger a workflow that adds or updates their information in a Mailchimp audience list, including their quiz results. This allows for personalized follow-up emails, tailored content delivery, or segmenting users based on their preferences.

- **Real-time Analytics Dashboard Update**: After a new set of quiz responses is collected, you could automate the transfer of this data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. From there, it’s possible to visualize this data using tools like Google Data Studio, providing up-to-date analytics to inform marketing strategies or content creation.

- **Lead Scoring and CRM Integration**: Use quiz results to score leads and automatically push this information into a CRM like Salesforce. Scoring can be based on the user's answers, indicating their interest level or fit for a product or service, allowing for more efficient lead prioritization and follow-up by the sales team.
