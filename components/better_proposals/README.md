# Overview

The Better Proposals API offers a powerful way to automate proposal creation and management tasks. With it, you can programmatically generate, send, and track business proposals, streamlining the sales process and integrating seamlessly with CRM systems. By leveraging Pipedreamâ€™s capabilities, you can connect Better Proposals to a multitude of other apps to trigger actions based on proposal activities, sync data, or even automate follow-ups, thereby enhancing the efficiency of your sales workflow.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Proposal Follow-ups**: After a proposal is sent using Better Proposals, you can trigger a workflow on Pipedream that waits for a specified period (e.g., two days) and then checks the proposal status. If it remains unviewed, the workflow could automatically send a reminder email to the prospect via an email platform like SendGrid or directly through your company's email server.

- **CRM Integration for Proposal Status Updates**: Once a proposal's status changes (e.g., from sent to viewed or accepted), trigger a workflow that updates the deal stage in your CRM system, such as Salesforce or HubSpot. This ensures that sales teams have the latest information without manual data entry, maintaining an up-to-date sales pipeline automatically.

- **Slack Notifications for Proposal Activities**: Configure a workflow that notifies a sales team in a specific Slack channel whenever a new proposal is sent or when there is a change in the proposal status. This real-time update system keeps everyone in the loop and can prompt immediate action when a proposal is accepted, speeding up the sales cycle.
