# Overview

The Greptile API is designed for enhancing web scraping and data extraction capabilities. By leveraging this API on Pipedream, users can automate the collection and processing of structured data from various websites dynamically. This API simplifies extracting data like prices, product descriptions, or social media sentiments and supports integration with numerous applications on Pipedream for further data manipulation, analysis, or storage.

# Example Use Cases

- **Competitor Price Monitoring**: Automate the monitoring of product prices across different e-commerce sites. Set up a Pipedream workflow where the Greptile API collects pricing data at scheduled intervals. Integrate this data with Google Sheets (or any database service like PostgreSQL) on Pipedream to record and analyze price trends over time.

- **Content Change Detection**: Create a workflow that uses the Greptile API to monitor changes on specific web pages, such as news sites or official announcements. Whenever a change is detected, the workflow can trigger notifications through services like Slack or email, keeping teams updated in real-time about critical information changes.

- **Social Media Sentiment Analysis**: Utilize the Greptile API to scrape social media posts or comments related to your brand or product. Integrate this data with a sentiment analysis tool available on Pipedream to evaluate public sentiment. The results can be automatically sent to a marketing team via tools like Trello or Asana, enabling timely and informed marketing decisions.
