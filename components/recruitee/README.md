# Overview

The Recruitee API allows you to automate and integrate your recruitment process with other tools and services. It provides programmatic access to manipulate jobs, candidates, and various recruitment activities. By using Pipedream, you can create custom workflows that interact with the Recruitee platform, enabling you to streamline your hiring process, synchronize recruitment data with other systems, and trigger actions based on recruitment events.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Candidates to Google Sheets**: When a new candidate applies, automatically add their details to a Google Sheet. This workflow uses the Recruitee API to detect new candidates and the Google Sheets API to update a spreadsheet, keeping a real-time record of applicants.

- **Trigger Email Campaigns for New Positions**: Send targeted email campaigns to potential candidates when a new job is posted. This workflow could use the Recruitee API to monitor for new jobs and trigger an email campaign via Mailchimp or another email service, ensuring prompt outreach to your talent pool.

- **Automate Candidate Evaluation Notifications**: Notify team members in Slack when a candidate reaches a specific stage in the evaluation process. This workflow would use the Recruitee API to watch for candidate status changes and the Slack API to send messages to the relevant hiring team's channel or direct messages to specific evaluators.
