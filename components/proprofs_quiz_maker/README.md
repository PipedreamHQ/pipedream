# Overview

The ProProfs Quiz Maker API lets you manage quizzes, questions, and results programmatically. With it, you can automate the creation of quizzes, extract quiz data, and integrate quiz results with other systems. On Pipedream, you can create workflows that trigger on a specific event, such as a new quiz completion, and connect with 3,000+ other apps to streamline your processes or enhance your data analysis.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Quiz Results to Google Sheets**: Every time a quiz is completed, the workflow triggers, fetching the results and appending them to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This allows you to analyze quiz data with the powerful tools available in Google Sheets.

- **Send Quiz Completion Notifications via Email**: Set up a workflow to send customized email notifications using an email service like SendGrid whenever a participant finishes a quiz. This could be useful for notifying teachers, managers, or team leaders about the performance of the quiz taker.

- **Create a Quiz Dashboard with Retool**: Combine quiz results with other data sources by sending the data to Retool. You can create an interactive dashboard that displays real-time quiz analytics, helping educators or trainers to make informed decisions based on the performance statistics.
