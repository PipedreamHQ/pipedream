# Overview

The Nexweave API lets you create personalized images and videos at scale, transforming static designs into dynamic templates. With it, you can automate the generation of customized content for email campaigns, social media, or advertising, by integrating user-specific data to create a more engaging and personalized experience. On Pipedream, you can harness this power to craft serverless workflows that trigger Nexweave's capabilities in response to various events and integrate them with other apps and services.
