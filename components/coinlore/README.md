# Overview

The CoinLore API provides real-time access to cryptocurrency market data, allowing you to fetch current prices, historical statistics, ticker information, and global market metrics. Leveraging Pipedream's serverless platform enables you to create automated workflows that can react to changes in cryptocurrency data, integrate with other services, and perform actions based on crypto market conditions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Crypto Alert System**: Build a workflow that triggers at regular intervals, fetching the latest price of a specific cryptocurrency from CoinLore. If the price hits a predefined threshold, send an alert via email or SMS using the integrated SendGrid or Twilio service on Pipedream. This keeps you informed about significant market movements without having to constantly monitor prices.

- **Portfolio Value Tracker**: Create a workflow that periodically retrieves your portfolio data from CoinLore, calculates the total value based on current market prices, and logs this information to a Google Sheet. Use this to track the value of your holdings over time, drawing on Pipedream's ability to seamlessly connect to Google's services.

- **Automated Crypto Trading**: Construct a Pipedream workflow that uses CoinLore API to monitor the market conditions for a set of cryptocurrencies. When specific trading signals are met, such as a rapid price increase or volume surge, the workflow could execute trades on a connected exchange like Binance or Coinbase through their respective APIs, enabling automated trading strategies.
