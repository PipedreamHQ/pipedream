# Overview

The Mode API provides programmatic access to Mode's analytics platform, allowing you to automate interactions with your Mode workspace. Using Mode with Pipedream, you can create workflows that interact with reports, queries, and spaces, or even manage members and permissions. This can include tasks like triggering a report run, fetching query results, or syncing users from other systems into Mode. By leveraging Pipedream's serverless platform, you can build robust, event-driven automations that integrate Mode with hundreds of other apps without the need for dedicated infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Report Generation and Distribution**: Schedule and trigger Mode report runs, then fetch the results and distribute them through email or messaging platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams. This workflow can ensure stakeholders receive timely analytics updates without manual intervention.

- **Synchronize Mode Spaces with External Data Sources**: Maintain a sync between Mode spaces and external databases or apps like Salesforce or Google Sheets. Whenever new data is added or updated in the external source, the workflow can update or create corresponding reports in Mode, keeping your data analysis up-to-date.

- **User Management Automation**: Streamline the process of managing Mode workspace members by automating user provisioning and deprovisioning based on events from HR systems like Workday or BambooHR. When a user's status changes in the HR system, it can trigger a workflow to update their permissions or remove them from your Mode workspace accordingly.
