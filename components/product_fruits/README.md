# Overview

The Product Fruits API offers tools for enhancing user experience with in-app guidance like tooltips, walkthroughs, and announcements. By leveraging this API within Pipedream, you can automate the creation, update, and tracking of these UX elements based on user behavior or feedback, enrich product engagement, and drive feature adoption. Combining Product Fruits with Pipedream's capabilities opens a realm of possibilities, from syncing user data to triggering in-app messages based on external events.

# Example Use Cases

- **User Onboarding Automation**: Trigger personalized onboarding flows in your application for new users by listening to signup events from your authentication platform (e.g., Auth0) on Pipedream. Create a workflow that activates specific Product Fruits guides based on the user's role or interests captured during the signup process.

- **Feature Announcement Broadcasting**: When you release a new feature, use Product Fruits to announce it to users. Set up a Pipedream workflow that monitors your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) for deployment of new releases and automatically triggers an in-app announcement via Product Fruits to inform users of the update.

- **Feedback-Driven Product Education**: Connect your customer support tool (e.g., Zendesk) with Product Fruits through Pipedream. Whenever a user submits a ticket related to a misunderstanding of a feature, automatically trigger a Product Fruits guide explaining that feature the next time they log in to your app.
