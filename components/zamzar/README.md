# Overview

The Zamzar API on Pipedream provides powerful file conversion capabilities, allowing you to easily automate the process of converting files between different formats. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can set up workflows that trigger conversions, handle the completed files, and integrate with other services for a seamless automation experience. From document conversion for data analysis to prepping media files for different platforms, Zamzar's API coupled with Pipedream's robust functionality opens up a world of possibilities for streamlining tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Document Conversion for Cloud Storage**: When a new document is uploaded to Google Drive, a Pipedream workflow can automatically trigger Zamzar to convert it to a different format (e.g., DOCX to PDF). Once the conversion is finished, the PDF can be saved back to Google Drive or another cloud storage service.

- **Image Format Standardization for Web Applications**: For a web app that requires images in a specific format, use Pipedream to watch for image uploads. Upon upload, trigger Zamzar to convert images to the required format (e.g., BMP to JPG) and then store the standardized images in an AWS S3 bucket.

- **Audio File Processing for Podcast Publishing**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to monitor a Dropbox folder for new audio files. Utilize Zamzar to convert these files from various formats to a uniform format (e.g., WAV to MP3) preferred for podcast distribution, and then automatically upload the processed files to a podcast hosting platform.
