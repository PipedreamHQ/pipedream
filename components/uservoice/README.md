# Overview

The UserVoice API allows you to tap into customer feedback and support data to automate and enhance customer engagement processes. With the API, you can programmatically access UserVoice accounts to retrieve suggestions, tickets, and user data, allowing you to analyze customer trends, automate responses, and integrate with other customer success platforms. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can create event-driven workflows that react to UserVoice events, synchronize data across multiple services, and construct a more responsive customer feedback loop.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync UserVoice Feedback to a CRM**: Keep your CRM up-to-date by creating a Pipedream workflow that listens for new UserVoice suggestions and automatically adds them as leads or notes to relevant contacts in Salesforce. This ensures your sales team always has the latest customer insights at their fingertips.

- **Automate Support Ticket Escalation**: Build a workflow where Pipedream monitors UserVoice for high-severity support tickets and, upon detection, triggers an alert in Slack and assigns the ticket to a senior support agent in Jira. This expedites the resolution process for critical issues.

- **UserVoice Analytics Dashboard**: Implement a workflow that periodically fetches data from UserVoice, such as ticket volume and resolution time, and sends it to Google Sheets. Use this data to populate a dashboard that provides real-time analytics, helping you to make informed decisions about your support strategy.
