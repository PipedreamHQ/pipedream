# Overview

The DeepSeek API leverages advanced image recognition technology to analyze and interpret visual data. With this API, you can extract meaningful information from images and videos, enabling applications like content moderation, automated tagging, and object recognition. When integrated into Pipedream workflows, DeepSeek can automate processes involving image analysis, trigger actions based on visual data, and connect with other apps to enhance data-driven decision-making.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Content Moderation Workflow**: Use DeepSeek to scan user-uploaded images on a platform for inappropriate content. If specific content types are detected, trigger automated responses such as flagging the content, notifying administrators, or removing the image from the platform, ensuring a safe user environment.

- **Real-Time Inventory Tracking**: Integrate DeepSeek in a retail environment to monitor shelf images captured by in-store cameras. Analyze these images to identify stock levels and automatically update inventory systems or trigger restocking processes when products are running low, optimizing inventory management.

- **Event-Triggered Social Media Monitoring**: Set up a workflow where DeepSeek analyzes images posted on social media for brand-related events or promotions. When specific objects or themes are detected, trigger marketing workflows that include sending personalized offers to the poster, sharing the content, or gathering insights for campaign effectiveness.
