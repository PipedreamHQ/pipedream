# Overview

The Altiria API is designed to empower users with SMS and MMS messaging capabilities. It allows for the sending of messages directly from applications, enabling real-time communication with customers, staff, or any target audience. This API is particularly useful for notifications, marketing campaigns, and automated alerts. Using Pipedream, these capabilities can be integrated into workflows that trigger based on various events from other apps, enriching your automation possibilities.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support Notifications**: Deploy a workflow where an Altiria SMS is automatically sent when a customer submits a support ticket via a platform like Zendesk. This SMS could confirm receipt of the ticket and provide an estimated response time, enhancing customer experience.

- **Marketing Campaign Trigger**: Set up a workflow that sends promotional SMS messages through Altiria when a new subscriber is added to a Mailchimp list. This can be used to immediately engage new subscribers with special offers or important updates, boosting your marketing efforts.

- **Event Reminder System**: Create a workflow that sends out SMS reminders to participants from a Google Calendar event. This ensures higher attendance rates and keeps participants informed about event details or last-minute changes.
