# Overview

The Brilliant Directories API lets you tap into the functionality of your directory software, enabling you to automate tasks, manage listings, users, and more. With Pipedream, you can build serverless workflows integrating the Brilliant Directories API to streamline operations, sync data across platforms, and react to events in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Member Onboarding**: Set up a workflow that triggers when a new member signs up on Brilliant Directories. The workflow can automatically add the member to a Mailchimp list for email marketing, send a welcome message via Twilio, and create a task in Trello for your team to follow up.

- **Directory Listing Sync**: Create a workflow that watches for updates to listings on Brilliant Directories and reflects those changes in real-time on other platforms like Salesforce or Airtable. This ensures that your sales team always has the latest information at their fingertips.

- **User Engagement Tracking**: Develop a workflow that captures user interactions on your directory, such as reviews or messages sent to listings. Feed this data into a Google Sheet for analysis or trigger an automated response via Slack to your customer engagement team to take action.
