# Overview

The Shipengine API enables robust automation possibilities for shipping logistics. From label creation, rate comparison, to tracking shipments, the API provides the tools to streamline e-commerce and shipping workflows. By harnessing Shipengine's capabilities through Pipedream, you can build seamless integrations that connect your shipping operations with other business processes, enhancing efficiency and reducing manual overhead.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Shipping Label Creation**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream when an order is placed in your e-commerce platform, like Shopify or WooCommerce. Automatically create a shipping label with Shipengine, attach the label to the customer's order details, and update the order status to "Shipped."

- **Real-time Shipping Rates Comparison**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers when a customer reaches the checkout page on your website. Call Shipengine to fetch real-time shipping rates from multiple carriers, then present the best options to the customer, optimizing for cost or delivery speed.

- **Order Tracking and Notifications**: Implement a workflow on Pipedream that monitors the status of shipments via Shipengine's tracking API. When a shipment status changes (e.g., "Out for Delivery"), send an automatic update to the customer through email or SMS, using services like SendGrid or Twilio.
