# Overview

The Clubworx API provides programmatic access to Clubworx, a gym and martial arts school management platform. With this API, you can automate various tasks such as managing members, tracking attendance, handling billing, and scheduling classes. Utilizing the Clubworx API in Pipedream allows for automated workflows that can save time by integrating with other services, triggering actions based on events, and syncing data across platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Members to a Mailchimp List:** Automatically add new Clubworx members to a Mailchimp list to streamline email marketing campaigns. When a new member is added in Clubworx, trigger a Pipedream workflow to subscribe that member to a Mailchimp audience, ensuring timely communication with all members.

- **Class Attendance to Google Sheets:** Record member attendance from Clubworx classes directly into a Google Sheet. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers after a class, pulls attendance data from Clubworx, and appends it to a Google Sheet for easy tracking and analytics.

- **Slack Notifications for Failed Payments:** Improve payment collection by getting instant Slack notifications for failed member payments in Clubworx. Create a Pipedream workflow that listens for payment failures and then sends a detailed alert to a designated Slack channel, allowing rapid follow-up and resolution.
