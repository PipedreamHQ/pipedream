# Overview

The SnatchBot API provides a programmatic window to SnatchBot's chatbot platform, allowing you to manage and interact with your bots outside of the SnatchBot interface. With this API, you can execute tasks like sending messages, retrieving chat history, and managing your bot's structure and behavior. When integrated into Pipedream workflows, the SnatchBot API shines in automating interactions, syncing chat data with other systems, and reacting to events with custom logic and third-party services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Customer Support Follow-Ups**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a SnatchBot conversation ends, then use the SendGrid app to email a follow-up survey to the user. This gathers feedback and improves your chatbot service.

- **Sync Chat Sessions to CRM**: After a conversation in SnatchBot, automatically create or update a contact record in a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. This keeps your customer profiles updated with the latest interaction details.

- **Broadcast Messages from Slack**: Use Pipedream to listen for commands in a Slack channel, then call the SnatchBot API to broadcast messages to users from within Slack. This is handy for timely announcements or alerts.
