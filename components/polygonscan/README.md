# Overview

The PolygonScan API provides access to blockchain data from the Polygon network. It allows for querying of blocks, transactions, and wallet addresses, among other data points. With Pipedream, you can integrate this API to automate monitoring, alerting, and data analysis tasks. You can leverage Pipedream's serverless platform to create workflows that react to events on the Polygon network in real-time, without having to manage infrastructure or write complex backend code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Transaction Alerts**: Create a workflow that listens for transactions to a specific wallet address on the Polygon network. Use Pipedream's built-in actions to send a notification via email, SMS, or a messaging app like Slack whenever a transaction occurs.

- **Periodic Portfolio Value Checker**: Schedule a Pipedream workflow to periodically fetch the balance of your Polygon wallet addresses and calculate the current value based on the latest token prices. Connect to a service like CoinGecko for price data and store the results in a Google Sheet for analysis.

- **Smart Contract Event Logger**: Watch for specific smart contract events on the Polygon network. Each time the event is emitted, the workflow captures the data and logs it to a database like PostgreSQL or sends it to a data visualization tool like Google Data Studio for monitoring and reporting.
