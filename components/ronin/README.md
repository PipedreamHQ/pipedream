  development, such as user feedback, product testing, and analytics

  and Skype to enable better collaboration and communication
- Third-party Integration – Use the Ronin API to connect with external software
  platforms and services (such as Salesforce or Dropbox) to extend the range of
  your project capabilities

  reports and analyze all sorts of data points for your projects
