# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Issues with GitHub**: Automatically create or update Fibery entities when new GitHub issues are opened or updated. This keeps development tasks in sync, allowing teams using Fibery for project tracking to stay up-to-date with real-time changes in the code repository.

- **Aggregate Customer Feedback**: Collect feedback from various sources like Zendesk, Intercom, or email, and create Fibery entities to track and prioritize customer input. This workflow enables product teams to integrate user feedback directly into their planning and development processes in Fibery.
