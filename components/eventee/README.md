# Overview

Eventee API allows you to integrate your event management capabilities seamlessly into Pipedream's serverless platform. With Eventee, you can automate tasks such as event creation, attendee management, and real-time updates for your conferences or gatherings. In Pipedream, you can create workflows that trigger on specific Eventee events, process data, and connect with other apps to streamline your event coordination efforts.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Event Creation and Announcement**: When a new event is planned, use Eventee to create the event and then automatically announce it via platforms like Slack or email. This can be set up in Pipedream to trigger when a new event is added to a project management tool like Trello or Asana.

- **Attendee Registration Sync**: Sync new attendee registrations from Eventee to a Google Sheet or a CRM like Salesforce. Each time an attendee registers through Eventee, a Pipedream workflow can add their details to your chosen app for easy tracking and management.

- **Real-time Event Updates**: Send real-time updates to attendees via SMS or messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Telegram whenever there's a change in the event schedule. Pipedream can listen for updates from Eventee and relay them instantly to keep everyone informed.
