# Overview

The Mercury API offers a window into banking tailored for startups. With it, you can automate your financial operations, sync transaction data with your accounting software, and monitor your business financial health programmatically. Creating workflows on Pipedream with Mercury's API allows you to connect your banking data with numerous other apps to streamline payments, reconcile transactions, and keep a pulse on your company's money matters.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Expense Tracking**: Integrate the Mercury API with Google Sheets on Pipedream to automatically log each transaction. Whenever a new transaction is posted to your Mercury account, a Pipedream workflow can trigger, appending the transaction details to a Google Sheet. This enables real-time expense tracking without manual data entry.

- **Alerts for Large Transactions**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers on high-value transactions from your Mercury bank account. Combine this with Twilio or another messaging service to send an SMS or an email alert to specified stakeholders, providing instant notifications on significant financial movements, keeping everyone in the loop for important or unusual activity.

- **Reconciliation with Accounting Software**: Automatically reconcile your transactions by connecting Mercury to accounting software like QuickBooks or Xero through Pipedream. Create a workflow that watches for new transactions in your Mercury account, then matches and records them in your accounting platform, ensuring your books are always up-to-date with minimal manual intervention.
