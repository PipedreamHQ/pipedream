# Overview

The Grafana API allows for programmatic interaction with Grafana, a popular open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Through this API, users can manage dashboards, alerts, users, and more. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can automate interactions between Grafana and various other services, streamlining analytics workflows and enhancing real-time data operations. This integration can be particularly powerful for updating dashboards, managing alerts, and syncing data across tools automatically.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Dashboard Updates on Data Changes**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when data in a connected database or application changes (e.g., SQL database update via Firebase). Then, use the Grafana API to automatically refresh or update relevant dashboards, ensuring that your monitoring displays are always showing the most current data.

- **Alert Management across Multiple Platforms**: Use Pipedream to listen for alerts from Grafana. When a specific alert condition is met, automatically post this alert to multiple platforms (like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and email) using their respective APIs. This multi-channel notification ensures that the right people are informed promptly about critical metrics or system issues.

- **User Management Automation**: Sync user roles and permissions between Grafana and other internal user management systems (e.g., Google Workspace or Okta). When a user's role is updated in your primary user management system, a Pipedream workflow can automatically update that user's permissions in Grafana, maintaining consistent access controls across your tools.
