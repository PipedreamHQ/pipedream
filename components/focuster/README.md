# Overview

The Focuster API lets you interact with your Focuster account to manage tasks and priorities, providing a programmatic way to create, update, and delete actions, as well as retrieve your focus sessions. In Pipedream, you can harness this API to build powerful automations that boost productivity by integrating Focuster with other apps. This enables you to sync tasks, set reminders, and organize your workflow in a more dynamic and interconnected way.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Focuster Actions with Google Calendar**: Automatically add your Focuster actions to Google Calendar. When you create a new action in Focuster, a Pipedream workflow can catch that event and create a corresponding event in Google Calendar, ensuring you never miss a task due to a scheduling conflict.

- **Aggregate Tasks from Multiple Platforms**: Collect tasks from various tools like Trello, Asana, or JIRA and input them into Focuster. Set up Pipedream to listen for new tasks on these platforms, then create corresponding actions in Focuster, centralizing your task management in one place.

- **Daily Task Digest via Email**: Configure Pipedream to generate a daily digest of your Focuster actions and send it to your email. This workflow can retrieve your tasks every morning, format them, and send an email with your day's focus, helping you stay on track from the moment you start work.
