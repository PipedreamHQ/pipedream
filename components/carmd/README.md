# Overview

The CarMD API taps into a vast database of car diagnostics and maintenance information. With it, you can fetch detailed reports on a vehicle's health, decode check engine lights, predict upcoming maintenance issues, and get fair estimates for repair costs. By integrating CarMD with Pipedream, you can automate workflows for vehicle management, create alerts for vehicle diagnostics, or build apps that help users maintain their cars better.

# Example Use Cases

- **Vehicle Health Monitoring System**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever a fleet vehicle completes a trip, using the CarMD API to conduct a quick diagnostic check. If any issues are detected, the workflow can automatically notify the fleet manager or schedule a maintenance appointment with a connected service like Google Calendar.

- **Automated Cost Estimation for Repairs**: Create a workflow that listens for new customer inquiries via a form on your website (using a service like Typeform). Use the CarMD API to estimate repair costs based on the vehicle's information provided by the customer. Then, email the estimate to the customer and add a new deal to a CRM like Salesforce.

- **Maintenance Alert System**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that checks the health of registered vehicles at regular intervals using the CarMD API. When it's time for routine maintenance or if an issue is found, send a reminder to the vehicle owner via SMS using Twilio, and log the alert in a data store for record-keeping.
