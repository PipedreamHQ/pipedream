With CalendarHero and Pipedream, you can create powerful workflows that respond dynamically to your calendar activities, ensuring you spend less time managing meetings and more time engaging in them.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Meeting Coordination with Slack**: When a new meeting is scheduled in CalendarHero, trigger a Pipedream workflow to post a message with meeting details to a designated Slack channel. This keeps your team informed and allows for quick follow-up actions or questions related to the meeting.

- **Dynamic CRM Updates**: After a meeting's completion, use CalendarHero to notify a Pipedream workflow which then logs the meeting details to a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. This ensures your sales and customer success teams have the latest information for each contact or account.

- **Email Follow-Up Automation**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream that listens for an event indicating a meeting has ended in CalendarHero. It then crafts and sends a customized follow-up email via SendGrid to all meeting participants, providing summaries, action items, or requests for feedback.
