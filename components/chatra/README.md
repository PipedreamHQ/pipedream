# Overview

The Chatra API enables the automation of customer support processes by allowing the programmatic sending of messages, retrieval of chat history, and management of ongoing conversations. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can harness this API to integrate real-time chat capabilities with other applications, set up automated responses based on specific triggers, and analyze customer interactions to enhance support strategies.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support Workflow**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow when a new message arrives in Chatra, analyze the content using sentiment analysis (with an app like MonkeyLearn), and respond automatically with predefined responses or escalate to a human agent based on the sentiment score.

- **E-commerce Order Support**: Integrate Chatra with Shopify using Pipedream. When a customer inquires about an order, automatically fetch order details from Shopify and provide real-time updates within the chat, enhancing customer experience and offloading work from support agents.

- **Support Ticket Integration**: Connect Chatra to a ticketing system like Zendesk on Pipedream. Whenever a chat in Chatra is tagged with 'support', automatically create a support ticket in Zendesk with chat details, streamlining the issue resolution process.
