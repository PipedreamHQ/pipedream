# Overview

Notion's API allows for the creation, reading, updating, and deleting of pages, databases, and their contents within Notion. Leveraging Pipedream's platform, you can build workflows that connect Notion with a myriad of other services to automate tasks such as content management, task tracking, and data synchronization. With Pipedream's serverless execution, you can trigger these workflows on a schedule, or by external events from other services, without managing any infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Sync Between Notion and a CMS**: Automatically push new blog posts from a Notion database to a CMS like WordPress, ensuring a seamless content flow from drafting to publishing.

- **Task Management with Todoist Integration**: When a new task is added to a Notion database, create a corresponding task in Todoist, and vice versa, keeping task lists synced across platforms.

- **Daily Sales Report Generation**: Gather sales data from a tool like Shopify at the end of each day, sum up total sales, and create a page in Notion with the day's sales summary for easy reporting.

# Troubleshooting

Note: After creating a new database, please reconnect your account and select it to enable access to Pipedream.
