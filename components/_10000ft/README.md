# Overview

The 10,000ft by Smartsheet API opens the door to managing project scheduling, resource allocation, and reporting in a programmatic fashion. This API allows you to automate the retrieval of project data, update assignments, track time and expenses, and generate real-time reports. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can create custom workflows that respond to events in 10,000ft, synchronize data across multiple systems, and streamline project management tasks.

# Example Use Cases

**Automated Project Tracking and Notifications**

- Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a new project is created in 10,000ft to notify team members via Slack or email. Subsequently, create tasks for the project in a tool like Trello or Asana, ensuring everyone is aligned and ready to start.

**Resource Allocation Analysis**

- Set up a Pipedream workflow to run on a schedule, fetching current project assignments from 10,000ft and comparing them against capacity data. If a resource is over-allocated, the workflow can send alerts to a project manager or directly update the allocation in 10,000ft to prevent burnout.

**Time Tracking Integration**

- Connect 10,000ft time tracking features with accounting software like QuickBooks. Use Pipedream to detect when a time entry is added in 10,000ft, process the data, and create an invoice in QuickBooks, automating the billing process based on actual hours worked.
