# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New WooCommerce Orders to AcyMailing List**: Automatically add customers to a specific AcyMailing subscriber list whenever a new order is placed on WooCommerce. This helps in segmenting customers based on purchase behavior and allows for targeted follow-up emails or promotional campaigns tailored to their interests.

- **Trigger Email Campaigns Based on Website Activity**: Set up a workflow where specific email campaigns are triggered through AcyMailing when a user performs a certain action on your website, like downloading a white paper or signing up for a webinar. Use Pipedream's HTTP / Webhook triggers to capture these events in real-time and initiate personalized email follow-ups.

- **Automate Email List Management with Google Sheets**: Whenever a new row is added to a designated Google Sheet (for example, from a signup form entry), automatically sync these details to an AcyMailing list. This is useful for maintaining updated and organized subscriber lists without manual data entry, ensuring that your email campaigns reach the intended audience efficiently.
