# Overview

The Resource Guru API lets you manage resources, bookings, and clients programmatically, which is key for automating scheduling and project management tasks. Within Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create workflows that trigger on various events, such as new bookings or changed availability, and perform actions like updating calendars, syncing with project management tools, or even sending notifications to team members.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Bookings with Google Calendar**: When a new booking is made in Resource Guru, a Pipedream workflow can trigger to automatically create an event in Google Calendar. This ensures that your schedule is always up-to-date across all platforms.

- **Manage Project Tasks in Asana**: Upon changing a booking status in Resource Guru, trigger a Pipedream workflow to update a corresponding task in Asana. This could include changing the task status, adjusting deadlines, or reassigning to different team members based on resource availability.

- **Send Slack Notifications on Resource Changes**: Configure a Pipedream workflow to send a notification to Slack whenever a resource is added or removed in Resource Guru. This keeps the entire team informed in real-time about the availability of personnel or equipment.
