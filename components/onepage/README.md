# Overview

The Onepage - Duplicate API allows you to manage and automate CRM activities within OnepageCRM, a streamlined customer relationship management solution. By using this API on Pipedream, you can create custom workflows to handle tasks such as updating contact information, creating deals, and syncing customer interactions across platforms. It's a powerful way to optimize sales processes, reduce manual data entry, and maintain up-to-date customer records.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Contact Synchronization**: Automatically sync new contacts from a Google Sheets spreadsheet to OnepageCRM. Whenever a new row is added in Google Sheets, Pipedream triggers a workflow that creates or updates a contact in OnepageCRM, ensuring your CRM always has the latest information.

- **Lead Qualification and Assignment**: When a new lead is captured via a Typeform submission, use Pipedream to assess the lead quality based on predefined criteria and assign it to the appropriate salesperson in OnepageCRM. This workflow ensures prompt follow-up and personalized engagement with potential customers.

- **Email Campaign Follow-Up**: Integrate OnepageCRM with SendGrid on Pipedream. After an email campaign is sent, trigger a workflow that creates follow-up tasks in OnepageCRM for each recipient who clicked a link in the email. This helps sales teams to timely engage interested prospects with relevant information.
