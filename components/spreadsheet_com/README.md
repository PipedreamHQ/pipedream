# Overview

The Spreadsheet.com API provides programmatic access to manage sheets, rows, and other data within Spreadsheet.com. Integrating this API into Pipedream allows you to automate tasks like updating rows based on external triggers, syncing data between multiple platforms, or even processing data using custom logic. With Pipedream, you can craft workflows that react in real-time to events, schedule data manipulation tasks, and connect to countless other services via their APIs.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Spreadsheet.com with Google Calendar**: When a new event is scheduled in Google Calendar, a Pipedream workflow can trigger to create or update a corresponding row in a Spreadsheet.com sheet, keeping a detailed log of your events and their details for easy tracking and analysis.

- **Manage Customer Support Tickets**: When a new support ticket is submitted through a platform like Zendesk, trigger a Pipedream workflow to add the ticket details to Spreadsheet.com. Further automation can notify support staff via Slack or email and update the ticket status in Spreadsheet.com based on follow-up actions.

- **Process E-commerce Orders**: Connect Spreadsheet.com to an e-commerce platform like Shopify. Each time an order is placed, a Pipedream workflow fires, adding order details to a sheet. It can also perform inventory checks, update stock levels, and send a restock request to your supplier if inventory runs low.
