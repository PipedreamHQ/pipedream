# Overview

The ngrok API allows you to control ngrok tunnels from your code, which can be immensely powerful when integrated into serverless workflows on Pipedream. By leveraging ngrok's API in a Pipedream workflow, you can dynamically manage HTTP tunnel lifecycles, capture and analyze inbound traffic data, and trigger events or actions in other systems based on the traffic going through ngrok tunnels. This makes it ideal for creating secure, introspective tunnels to localhost or other on-premise services for development, testing, or even production purposes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Dynamic Development Environments**: Automatically set up ngrok tunnels when a developer starts their day and close them when they end, integrating with GitHub to notify team members through issues or comments about the active development URL.

- **Webhook Testing Workflow**: Create a Pipedream workflow that spins up an ngrok tunnel to expose your local development server to the internet. This can be triggered remotely from Slack, allowing developers to share a temporary, secure URL with team members or stakeholders for immediate feedback on web-based projects.

- **Automated Error Logging**: Combine ngrok with a logging service like Sentry via Pipedream. Set up a workflow where any requests to your localhost through ngrok that result in errors (status codes 4xx or 5xx) are automatically captured and logged in Sentry for debugging.
