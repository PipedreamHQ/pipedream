# Overview

The Etherscan API provides a lens into the Ethereum blockchain, allowing you to query for transaction details, wallet balances, smart contract events, and more. By bringing Etherscan into Pipedream's serverless integration platform, you can automate interactions with Ethereum data, create event-driven workflows, and connect blockchain insights to 3,000+ other apps without a line of backend code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Monitor Wallet Transactions**: Trigger a workflow whenever a transaction occurs involving a specific Ethereum wallet. Use this to notify yourself via services like Slack or email, or archive this data for analysis in Google Sheets or a database.

- **Track Smart Contract Events**: Create automations that respond to specific events emitted by a smart contract. For instance, when a new token is minted or transferred, trigger a workflow that updates a dashboard in real-time or alerts a Discord channel for community engagement.

- **Analyze Gas Prices for Transactions**: Schedule a workflow to fetch current Ethereum gas prices at regular intervals. Use this data to advise on the best times for executing transactions, and automatically adjust your app's suggested fees, or inform users via a bot on Telegram or SMS.
