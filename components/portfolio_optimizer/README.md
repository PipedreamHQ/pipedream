# Overview

The Portfolio Optimizer API allows you to build advanced financial models and investment strategies directly within Pipedream. With this API, you gain access to portfolio analysis tools that can optimize asset allocations, calculate efficient frontiers, and perform risk assessments. Leverage the power of Pipedream's serverless platform to automate these tasks, integrate with other financial data sources, and much more, facilitating smarter investment decisions and real-time portfolio management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Portfolio Rebalancing**: Trigger a workflow on a schedule to analyze your investment portfolio using the Portfolio Optimizer API. This workflow could fetch current asset prices from a finance app like Yahoo Finance, calculate the optimal asset mix, and if necessary, send orders to a brokerage service or send alerts for manual rebalancing.

- **Risk Analysis Reporting**: Connect the Portfolio Optimizer API to your data warehouse where your financial data is stored. Periodically, trigger a Pipedream workflow to pull the latest data, use the API to assess portfolio risk, and generate a report. Email this risk analysis to stakeholders or save it to cloud storage such as Google Drive or Dropbox for easy access.

- **Investment Strategy Backtesting**: Combine historical stock data from apps like Alpha Vantage with the Portfolio Optimizer API within a Pipedream workflow. Test different investment strategies by backtesting against historical data to find the most efficient portfolio model, and then automatically publish the results to a Google Sheets spreadsheet or a Slack channel dedicated to investment strategy discussions.
