# Overview

BART API

With the BART API, you can retrieve real-time departure information for the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system. This information can be used to build applications that help people find the best way to get around the Bay Area.

Some example applications that could be built using the BART API include:

- A tool that helps people plan their trips on BART, including finding the best route and determining how long it will take

- A real-time tracker that shows where BART trains are and how long it will be until they arrive at a given station

- A notification system that alerts people when their train is about to arrive, so they can make sure they're at the station on time
