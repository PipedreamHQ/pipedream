# Overview

The GetEmails API provides a means to identify anonymous traffic on your website and retrieve contact information for remarketing purposes. With this API integrated into Pipedream workflows, you can automate the process of capturing leads, enriching customer profiles, and triggering personalized communication. Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform allows you to connect GetEmails to a vast array of services, enabling seamless data flow between lead capture and your marketing or CRM tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Capture to Email Marketing**: Once you obtain leads via GetEmails, set up a Pipedream workflow to automatically add these contacts to an email marketing platform like Mailchimp. This ensures immediate engagement with newly captured leads through welcome emails or nurturing campaigns.

- **Sync Leads to CRM**: Integrate GetEmails with a CRM like Salesforce using Pipedream. Automatically create new contacts or update existing records as soon as new email data is available, ensuring your sales team has the latest information for follow-up.

- **Webhook Triggered Lead Alerts**: Use Pipedream to create a workflow where inbound leads from GetEmails trigger a webhook, sending real-time notifications to Slack or another messaging platform. Stay alert with instant updates whenever a new lead is captured.
