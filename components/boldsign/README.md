# Overview

BoldSign API offers robust features for handling e-signature processes, making it a valuable tool for automating document signing workflows. By integrating BoldSign with Pipedream, developers can automate signature requests, track document status, and manage signed documents seamlessly. This integration allows for connecting various services to streamline operations that involve legal agreements, contracts, or any formal documentation requiring a signature.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Workflow for New Employees**: Automatically send employment contracts for signature when a new employee is added to an HR system like BambooHR. Once signed, the document can be stored in a secure cloud storage service like Google Drive and the employee's record in the HR system can be updated.

- **Onboarding Client Agreements**: Trigger the sending of client service agreements when a new client is added to a CRM like Salesforce. Follow up with an automated email through SendGrid once the document is signed, confirming the agreement and providing additional onboarding information.

- **Real Estate Closing Documents**: Automate the process of sending real estate closing documents when a new property sale is recorded in a real estate app. Use Twilio to send SMS notifications to both buyer and seller about the status of the document signing process.
