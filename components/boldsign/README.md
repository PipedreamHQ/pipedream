# Example Use Cases

Once signed, the contract can be stored automatically in a cloud storage service like Google Drive and relevant stakeholders can be notified via email or messaging apps like Slack.

- **Onboarding Process Automation**: Speed up employee onboarding by sending all necessary employment documents for signature when a new employee record is created in your HR management system. Upon completion, update the employee's status in the HR system and notify the IT department to provision necessary IT equipment and accounts.

Upon their approval and signature, update the project status and archive the signed document in a secure repository.
