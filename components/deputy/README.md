# Overview

Deputy is a robust workforce management tool, catering to scheduling, timesheet tracking, and other employee coordination tasks. Leveraging the Deputy API on Pipedream allows you to automate mundane tasks, sync data across platforms, and create custom notifications based on employee actions. You could build workflows to manage shifts, sync employee details with HR systems, or trigger payroll processes, harnessing Pipedream's capability to integrate with various services without the need for manual coding.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Timesheet Reporting**: Pull timesheets from Deputy as they're submitted and feed them into a Google Sheets document. This is great for streamlining payroll processes or providing regular reports to management on employee hours.

- **Scheduling Sync-Up**: When a new shift is published or updated in Deputy, trigger a workflow that syncs this info with a shared company calendar on Office 365 or Google Calendar, keeping everyone informed and up-to-date.

- **Employee Onboarding**: When a new employee is added to Deputy, automatically send their details to an HR system like BambooHR or Workday, and enroll them in necessary training courses via an LMS like Lessonly or TalentLMS.
