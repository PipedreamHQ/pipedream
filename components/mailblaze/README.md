# Overview

MailBlaze API allows users to automate email marketing tasks directly through Pipedream, including managing subscribers, sending emails, and analyzing campaign performance. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can integrate MailBlaze with other apps to streamline your marketing workflows, enhance customer engagement, and track the effectiveness of your campaigns in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Welcome Email Sequence**: When a new subscriber is added to a MailBlaze list, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends a series of welcome emails. This can be set up to send an initial welcome email immediately, followed by additional emails that provide more information about your services or products over the following days.

- **Subscriber Segmentation and Targeted Campaigns**: Use Pipedream to integrate MailBlaze with a CRM like Salesforce. Whenever a new lead is categorized as 'interested' in the CRM, add them to a specific subscriber list in MailBlaze and trigger a targeted email campaign that fits their interest profile.

- **Real-Time Campaign Performance Dashboard**: Connect MailBlaze to a data visualization tool like Google Sheets or Tableau via Pipedream. Each time an email campaign is sent, use Pipedream to extract campaign performance data (open rate, click rate, etc.) and log this data in your dashboard for real-time analysis and decision-making.
