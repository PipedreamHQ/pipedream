# Overview

The Poof API lets you schedule and automate emails and SMS messages, making it a powerful tool for communication-based workflows. With Pipedream, you can connect the Poof API to hundreds of other services to craft custom automations. Trigger events, process data, and design complex interactions without managing a server infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Follow-Up**: Initiate a Poof API call to send follow-up emails or SMS messages after a customer completes a purchase on your e-commerce platform. This can involve thanking them, requesting feedback, or offering post-purchase support.

- **Event Reminder System**: Use Pipedream to schedule reminders for events. When a user registers for an event on your website, trigger a workflow that sends out confirmation and reminder messages via Poof API as the event date approaches.

- **Marketing Campaigns Coordination**: With Poof API on Pipedream, set up a workflow where marketing campaign leads captured through a form submission app, like Typeform, are automatically added to a Poof mailing list for a scheduled promotional campaign.
