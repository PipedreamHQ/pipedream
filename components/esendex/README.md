# Overview

The Esendex API enables seamless SMS and voice messaging integration into your applications, allowing for automated communication with customers or systems. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to create serverless workflows that react to various triggers, from inbound messages to scheduled times, and interact with other services to provide a cohesive automation experience.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support Notifications**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream when a new ticket is created in your helpdesk software, like Zendesk, and use the Esendex API to send an SMS update to the customer with their ticket number and expected response time.

- **Appointment Reminder System**: Use a scheduled trigger in Pipedream to sift through a Google Calendar or database for upcoming appointments and send a reminder via Esendex SMS to clients 24 hours before their scheduled time.

- **Real-time Alerts for Server Downtime**: Connect Pipedream to monitoring tools like Datadog to initiate a workflow when a server issue is detected. Use the Esendex API to dispatch immediate SMS alerts to your IT team for rapid response.
