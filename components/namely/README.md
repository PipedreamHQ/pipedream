# Overview

The Namely API provides a set of tools that you can use to build applications
that interact with Namely data. With the Namely API, you can:

- Retrieve information about Namely accounts, users, and jobs
- Create and update Namely data
- Search for Namely data
- Authenticate Namely users

Here are some examples of what you can build with the Namely API:

- A web application that allows Namely users to view and update their account
  information
- A mobile application that allows Namely users to search for jobs and view job
  descriptions
- An application that allows Namely administrators to manage account data and
  user permissions
