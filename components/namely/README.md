# Example Use Cases

- **Employee Onboarding Automations**: When a new employee record is created in Namely, trigger a Pipedream workflow to set up accounts in tools like Slack, G Suite, and GitHub. This flow could also assign tasks in project management software like Trello or Asana, ensuring new hires have a structured onboarding process.

- **Payroll Change Notifications**: Monitor changes in employee payroll details on Namely and use Pipedream to notify finance and the affected employee via email through SendGrid or Slack. This workflow ensures transparency and quick updates on critical payroll adjustments.

- **Time-off Sync to Calendar**: Sync employee time-off requests from Namely to a company-wide calendar like Google Calendar or Outlook. When a time-off request is approved, Pipedream automatically creates an event on the calendar, keeping everyone informed and aiding in resource planning.
