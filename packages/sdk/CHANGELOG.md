## [1.0.2] - 2024-11-14

### Changed

- Deprecated the `environment_name` field in the `ConnectTokenOpts` type, as it

  exclusively determined by the `environment` field in the `BackendClientOpts`
  type, read during the client creation.

### Added

- Added a new optional flag to `RequestOptions` called `fullResponse`, which
  allows the user to get the full HTTP response object, including the headers
  and status code.

  kind of client they are creating.

  token-based authentication using OAuth.
