## Pipedream Apps

All Pipedream apps are Node.js modules that have a default export: a javascript object - a Pipedream app - as its single argument.
It is essentially a wrapper on an API that requires authentication. Pipedream facades the authentication data in an object accessed by `this.$auth`. All app objects have three four keys: type, app, propDefinitions, and methods. The app object contains a `type` property, which is always set to "app". The `app` property is the name of the app, e.g. "google_sheets". The propDefinitions property is an object that contains the props for the app. The methods property is an object that contains the methods for the app.

Here's an example Pipedream app for Raindrop:

```javascript
import { axios } from "@pipedream/platform";

export default {
  type: "app",
  app: "raindrop",
  propDefinitions: {
    collectionId: {
      type: "string",
      label: "Collection ID",
      description: "The collection ID",
      async options() {
        const { items } = await this.getCollections();
        return items.map((e) => ({
          value: e._id,
          label: e.title,
        }));
      },
    },
    raindropId: {
      type: "string",
      label: "Bookmark ID",
      description: "Existing Bookmark ID",
      async options({
        prevContext, collectionId,
      }) {
        const page = prevContext.page
          ? prevContext.page
          : 0;
        const { items } = await this.getRaindrops(this, collectionId, {
          page,
        });
        return {
          options: items.map((e) => ({
            value: e._id,
            label: e.title,
          })),
          context: {
            page: page + 1,
          },
        };
      },
    },
  },
  methods: {
    async _makeRequest($ = this, opts) {
      const {
        method = "get",
        path,
        data,
        params,
        ...otherOpts
      } = opts;
      return axios($, {
        ...otherOpts,
        method,
        url: `https://api.raindrop.io/rest/v1${path}`,
        headers: {
          ...opts.headers,
          "user-agent": "@PipedreamHQ/pipedream v0.1",
          "Authorization": `Bearer ${this.$auth.oauth_access_token}`,
        },
        data,
        params,
      });
    },
    async getCollections($) {
      return this._makeRequest($, {
        path: "/collections",
      });
    },
    async getRaindrops($, collectionId, params) {
      return this._makeRequest($, {
        path: `/raindrops/${collectionId}`,
        params,
      });
    },
  },
};
```

This object contains a `propDefinitions` property, which contains the definitions for the props of the app.

The propDefinitions object contains two props: collectionId and raindropId. The collectionId prop is a string prop. The raindropId prop is also a string prop. The propDefinitions object also contains an `options` method. The `options` method is an optional method that can be defined on a prop. It is used to dynamically generate the options for a prop and can return a static array of options or a Promise that resolves to an array of options.

This object contains a `props` property, which defines a single prop of type "app":

```javascript
import { axios } from "@pipedream/platform";
export default {
  type: "app",
  app: "the_app_name",
  propDefinitions: {
    prop_key: {
      type: "string",
      label: "Prop Label",
      description: "A description of the prop",
      async options() {
        const static_options = ["option 1", "option 2"]; // a static array of options
        const dynamic_options = await this.getOptions(); // a Promise that resolves to an array of options.
        return dynamic_options; // return the options
      },
    }
  },
  methods: {
    async _makeRequest($ = this, opts) {
      const {
        method = "get",
        path,
        data,
        params,
        ...otherOpts
      } = opts;
      return await axios($, {
        ...otherOpts,
        method,
        url: `https://api.the_app_name.com${path}`, // the base URL of the app API
        headers: {
          ...opts.headers,
          "Authorization": `Bearer ${this.$auth.oauth_access_token}`, // the authentication type depends on the app
        },
        params,
        data,
      })
    },
    async getOptions() {
      // the code to get the options
      return await this._makeRequest({
        ...opts,
      })
    },
  },
}
```

This lets the user connect their app account to the step, authorizing requests to the app API.

`this` exposes the user's app credentials in the object `this.$auth`. For integrations where users provide static API keys / tokens, the $auth object contains properties for each key / token the user enters. For OAuth integrations, this object exposes the OAuth access token in the oauth_access_token property of the $auth object.

The app can be a key-based app. For integrations where users provide static API keys / tokens, `this.$auth` contains properties for each key / token the user enters. Users are asked to enter custom fields. They are each exposed as properties in the object `this.$auth`. When you make the API request, use the format from the app docs. Different apps pass credentials in different places in the HTTP request, e.g. headers, url params, etc.

The app can also be an OAuth app. For OAuth integrations, this object exposes the OAuth access token in the variable `this.$auth.oauth_access_token`. When you make the API request, make sure to use the format from the app docs, e.g. you may need to pass the OAuth access token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.

The app code should contain a `propDefinitions` property, which are the definitions for the props. Props lets the user pass data to the step via a form in the Pipedream UI, so they can fill in the values of the variables. Include any required parameters as properties of the `props` object. Props must include a human-readable `label` and a `type` (one of string|boolean|integer|object) that corresponds to the Node.js type of the required param. string, boolean, and integer props allow for arrays of input, and the array types are "string[]", "boolean[]", and "integer[]" respectively. Complex props (like arrays of objects) can be passed as string[] props, and each item of the array can be parsed as JSON. If the user asks you to provide an array of object, ALWAYS provide a `type` of string[]. Optionally, props can have a human-readable `description` describing the param. Optional parameters that correspond to the test code should be declared with `optional: true`. Recall that props may contain an `options` method.

The `methods` property contains auxiliary methods. A `async _makeRequest` method is always required. It contains the code that makes the API request. It takes two arguments: `$ = this` and `opts`. `$` is the context passed by the Pipedream runtime. It should default to `this`. `opts` is an object that contains the parameters of the API request. The `opts` object may contain the following fields: `method`, `path`, `data`, `params`, and `headers`. The `method` field is the HTTP method of the request. The `path` field is the path of the request. The `data` field is the body of the request. The `params` field is the query parameters of the request. The `headers` field is the headers of the request. The `opts` object also contains any other fields that are passed to the `_makeRequest` method. The `_makeRequest` method returns a Promise that resolves to the HTTP response data. There is NO `data` property in the response that contains the data. The data from the HTTP response is returned directly in the response, not in the `data` property.

The axios request uses the authentication method defined by the app. Different apps pass credentials in different places in the HTTP request, e.g. headers, url params, etc. The axios request should use the format from the app docs.

Auxiliary methods, usually for CRUD operations call `_makeRequest` with the appropriate parameters. Please add a few methods for common operations, e.g. get and list. You can also add other methods that you think are useful.

For listing operations, verify how the pagination is done in the API. Also add a method for pagination. This method should be named `paginate`, and the arguments are `fn`, the listing method that will be called, and `...opts`, the parameters of the HTTP request. The method starts with an empty array, and calls the listing method with the parameters. It then checks the response and verifies if there is more data. If it does, it calls itself with the listing method and the parameters for fetching the next set of data. If it doesn't, it returns the array of results.

## Pipedream Platform Axios

Always use the `axios` constructor from the `@pipedream/platform` package, and include the following import at the top of your Node.js code, above the component, in this exact format:

import { axios } from "@pipedream/platform";

You MUST use that import format when importing axios. Do NOT attempt to import any other package like `import axios from "@pipedream/platform/axios"`.

The `axios` constructor takes two arguments:

1. `this` - the context passed by the run method of the component.

2. `config` - the same as the `config` object passed to the `axios` constructor in the standard `axios` package, with some extra properties.

For example:

return await axios($, {
  url: `https://api.openai.com/v1/models`,
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${this.openai.$auth.api_key}`,
  },
})

`@pipedream/platform` axios returns a Promise that resolves to the HTTP response data. There is NO `data` property in the response that contains the data. The data from the HTTP response is returned directly in the response, not in the `data` property.

## Async options

The `options` method is an optional method that can be defined on a prop. It is used to dynamically generate the options for a prop and can return a static array of options or a Promise that resolves to an array of options:

```
[
  {
    label: "Human-readable option 1",
    value: "unique identifier 1",
  },
  {
    label: "Human-readable option 2",
    value: "unique identifier 2",
  },
]
```

The `label` MUST BE a human-readable name of the option presented to the user in the UI, and the `value` is the value of the prop in the `run` method. The `label` MUST be set to the property that defines the name of the object, and the `value` should be the property that defines the unique identifier of the object.

If an API endpoint exists that can be used to fetch the options for the prop, you MUST define an `async` options method. This allows Pipedream to make an API call to fetch the options for the prop when the user is configuring the component, rather than forcing the user to enter values for the option manually. Think about it: this is so much easier for the user.

Example async options methods:

```
msg: {
  type: "string",
  label: "Message",
  description: "Select a message to `console.log()`",
  async options() {
    // write any node code that returns a string[] (with label/value keys)
    return ["This is option 1", "This is option 2"];
  },
},
```

```
board: {
  type: "string",
  label: "Board",
  async options(opts) {
    const boards = await this.getBoards(this.$auth.oauth_uid);
    const activeBoards = boards.filter((board) => board.closed === false);
    return activeBoards.map((board) => {
      return { label: board.name, value: board.id };
    });
  },
},
```

```
async options(opts) {
  const response = await axios(this, {
    method: "GET",
    url: `https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/playlists`,
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer \${this.spotify.$auth.oauth_access_token}`,
    },
  });
  return response.items.map((playlist) => {
    return { label: playlist.name, value: playlist.id };
  });
},
```

## Additional rules

1. Use ESM for all imports, not CommonJS. Place all imports at the top of the file, above `export default`.

2. Include all required headers and parameters in the API request. Please pass literal values as the values of all required params. Use the proper types of values, e.g. "test" for strings and true for booleans.

3. Always use the correct HTTP method in the `axios` request. Compare this to other code examples you've been trained on.

4. Double-check the code against known Node.js examples, from GitHub and any other real code you find.

## Remember, return ONLY code

Only return Node.js code. DO NOT include any English text before or after the Node.js code. DO NOT say something like "Here's an example..." to preface the code. DO NOT include the code in Markdown code blocks, or format it in any fancy way. Just show me the code.

Consider all the instructions and rules above, and use the following code as a template for your code: %s
