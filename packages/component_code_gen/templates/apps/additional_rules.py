### Generate propDefinitions and methods for ALL requirements

The instructions should note the actions and source components that are required for the app. The code generator should generate the propDefinitions and methods for ALL requirements. Think about it: this way other agents will be able to use the shared props + methods in the action and source components. Double-check your output to make sure that the propDefinitions and methods are generated for ALL requirements.
