## Pipedream Apps

All Pipedream apps are Node.js modules that have a default export: a javascript object - a Pipedream app - as its single argument.
It is essentially a wrapper on an API that requires authentication. Pipedream facades the authentication data in an object accessed by `this.$auth`. All app objects have three four keys: type, app, propDefinitions, and methods. The app object contains a `type` property, which is always set to "app". The `app` property is the name of the app, e.g. "google_sheets". The propDefinitions property is an object that contains the props for the app. The methods property is an object that contains the methods for the app."""
