prop_definitions = """## Prop Definitions

The app code should contain a `propDefinitions` property, which are the definitions for the props. Props lets the user pass data to the step via a form in the Pipedream UI, so they can fill in the values of the variables. Include any required parameters as properties of the `props` object. Props must include a human-readable `label` and a `type` (one of string|boolean|integer|object) that corresponds to the Node.js type of the required param. string, boolean, and integer props allow for arrays of input, and the array types are "string[]", "boolean[]", and "integer[]" respectively. Complex props (like arrays of objects) can be passed as string[] props, and each item of the array can be parsed as JSON. If the user asks you to provide an array of object, ALWAYS provide a `type` of string[]. Optionally, props can have a human-readable `description` describing the param. Optional parameters that correspond to the test code should be declared with `optional: true`. Recall that props may contain an `options` method."""
