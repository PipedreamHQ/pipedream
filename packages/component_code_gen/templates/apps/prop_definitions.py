prop_definitions = """## Prop Definitions

The app code should contain a `propDefinitions` property, which are the definitions for the props. 

You'll find a Props section below that outlines the rules for generating props. All of those rules are valid, BUT instead of placing them in a `props` property, you MUST place props in the `propDefinitions` property. This is how Pipedream app files expect props to be declared.
