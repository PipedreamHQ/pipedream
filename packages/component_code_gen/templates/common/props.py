props = """## Props

The object must contain a `props` property. Props lets the user pass data to the step via a form in the Pipedream UI, so they can fill in the values of the variables. 

export default {
  ...
  props: {
    slack: {
      type: "app",
      app: "slack",
    },
    channel: {
      type: "string",
      label: "Channel",
      description: "The channel to post the message to",
    },
    text: {
      type: "string",
      label: "Message Text",
      description: "The text of the message to post",
    },
  },
};

### Naming conventions are critical

If the instructions say to use a particular prop name, you must use that for the prop key in the `props` object. For example, if the instructions say to use `propName`, you must use `propName`. You cannot use `prop_name` or `propname`. The case the instructions provided are the only valid case.

### Required props

You MUST include any required parameters of the API requests in the component as properties of the `props` object. In the example above, `channel` and `text` are required parameters of the Slack API request, so they are included as props.

Add these at the top of the `props` object, so it's easier for me to identify them.

### Additional rules

Props must include a human-readable `label` and a `type` (one of string|boolean|integer|object) that corresponds to the Node.js type of the required param. 

string, boolean, and integer props allow for arrays of input, and the array types are "string[]", "boolean[]", and "integer[]" respectively. 

Complex props (like arrays of objects) can be passed as string[] props, and each item of the array can be parsed as JSON. If the user asks you to provide an array of object, ALWAYS provide a `type` of string[]. 

export default {
  ...
  props: {
    complexProp: {
      type: "string[]",
      label: "Complex Prop",
      description: "An array of objects",
    }
  },
  run() {
    const complexProp = this.complexProp.map(JSON.parse);
    // complexProp is now an array of objects
  }
};

Optionally, props can have a human-readable `description` describing the param. 

### Optional props

DO NOT INCLUDE optional API parameters as props unless specified by the user. ONLY include props required by the API or specified in the instructions.

Optional parameters that correspond to the test code should be declared with `optional: true`. Recall that props may contain an `options` method.

export default {
  ...
  props: {
    optionalProp: {
      type: "string",
      label: "Optional Prop",
      description: "An optional prop",
      optional: true,
    },
  },
};

`optional: false` is the default, so you don't need to include it for required props.

Within the component's run method, the `this` variable refers to properties of the component. All props are exposed at `this.<name of the key in the props object>`. e.g. `this.input`. `this` doesn't contain any other properties.

export default {
  ...
  props: {
    input: {
      type: "string",
      label: "Input",
      description: "An input",
    },
  },
  run() {
    console.log(this.input);
  }
};
