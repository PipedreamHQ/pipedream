How to send myself a direct message?

## API docs

### Picking the right conversation

Now we need to find somewhere within your workspace that we'll send a message. This could be any Slack conversation, but we'll use a public channel in this guide.

We'll remind you again - it's not a good idea to attempt the instructions in this guide with a real, living workspace. If you really have to, then at least create a new, empty public channel within the workspace, for testing purposes.

In order to find a valid Slack conversation ID, we'll use the conversations.list API method. This API will return a list of all public channels in the workspace your app is installed to. You'll need the channels:read permission granted to your app.

Within that list, we'll be able to find a specific id of the conversation that we want to access. Here's an example API call:

GET https://slack.com/api/conversations.list
Authorization: Bearer xoxb-your-token

### Publishing your message

We're nearly there, we just need to make one more API call, this time to chat.postMessage. Again substitute in the values of the token and conversation ID that you noted earlier:

POST https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage
Content-type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer xoxb-your-token
{
  "channel": "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID",
  "text": "Hello world :tada:"
}
