# Overview

## What is Pipedream?

Pipedream is a production-scale serverless platform to connect APIs, remarkably fast.

1. Connect OAuth and key-based API accounts in seconds.
2. Use connected accounts in Node.js code steps or no-code building blocks.
3. Build and run workflows triggered on HTTP requests, schedules, app events and more.

<!--Pipedream also makes it easy to test and validate your integrations, scaffold API requests for any app, maintain state between executions, manage execution rate and concurrency and more. -->

<!--With Pipedream, you can stop writing boilerplate code, struggling with authentication and managing infrastructure, and start connecting APIs with code-level control when you need it — and no code when you don't. -->

<!--Pipedream is a low code integration platform for developers. We make it easy to connect APIs remarkably fast so you can stop writing boilerplate code, struggling with authentication and managing infrastructure, and start connecting APIs with code-level control when you need it — and no code when you don't.-->

## How Pipedream Works

Pipedream provides a serverless platform to build and run workflows that connect APIs:

- Connect your OAuth and key-based API accounts in seconds
- Use connected accounts to auth APIs in code steps or in "no code" building blocks
- Compose steps into workflows and trigger on HTTP requests, schedules or app events

Pipedream also provides easy to use services to solve common serverless and integration challenges including state management, execution rate and concurrency controls, large file support (up to 5TB) and more!

## Is Pipedream for Me?

We make it easy to connect APIs with code-level control when you need it — and no code when you don't. If you and your team want to stop writing boilerplate code, struggling with authentication and managing infrastructure for integrations, then Pipedream is for you. 

Developers with a working knowledge of Node.js or Javascript will get the most value from Pipedream (Python, TypeScript, and GitHub integration are coming soon).

## Open Source

Pipedream maintains an [open source component registry](https://github.com/pipedreamhq/pipedream/) on GitHub so you can avoid writing boilerplate code for common API integrations. Use components as no code building blocks in workflows, or use them to scaffold code that you can customize. You can also [create a PR contribute new or enhanced components](/components/guidelines/#process) via GitHub.
