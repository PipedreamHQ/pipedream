# Introduction to Pipedream

Pipedream is the fastest way to automate any process that connects APIs. Build and run workflows with code-level control when you need it, and no code when you don't. 

The Pipedream platform includes:

- A [serverless runtime](/code/) and [workflow service](/workflows/)
- Open source [triggers](/workflows/steps/triggers/) and [actions](/components#actions) for [hundreds of integrated apps](https://pipedream.com/explore/)
- One-click [OAuth and key-based authentication](/connected-accounts/) for hundreds of APIs (use tokens directly in code or with pre-built actions)

Watch a demo or review our [quickstart guide](/quickstart/):

The platform processes billions of events and is built and [priced](https://pipedream.com/pricing/) for use at scale. [Our team](https://pipedream.com/about) has built internet scale applications and managed data pipelines in excess of 10 million events per second (EPS) at startups and high-growth environments like BrightRoll, Yahoo!, Affirm and Instacart. 

Our [community](https://pipedream.com/community) uses Pipedream for a wide variety of use cases including:

- Connecting SaaS apps
- General API orchestration and automation
- Database automations ([reach out](https://pipedream.com/community) to learn about connecting to resources behind a firewall)
- Custom notifications and alerting
- Mobile and JAMstack backends
- Rate limiting, request smoothing
- Event queueing and concurrency management
- Webhook inspection and routing
- Prototyping and demos

## Open Source

Pipedream maintains an [open source component registry](https://github.com/pipedreamhq/pipedream/) on GitHub so you can avoid writing boilerplate code for common API integrations. Use components as no code building blocks in workflows, or use them to scaffold code that you can customize. You can also [create a PR to contribute new components](/components/guidelines/#process) via GitHub.
