# Quickstart: Source Development

This document is intended for a technical audience (including those interested in learning how to author and edit components).  After completing this quickstart, you will understand how to:

- Deploy components to Pipedream using the CLI
- Invoke a component manually, or on a schedule or HTTP request
- Maintain state across component invocations
- Emit deduped events using the `unique` and `greatest` strategies
- Use Pipedream managed OAuth for an app
- Use npm packages in components

We recommend that you execute the examples in order — each one builds on the concepts and practices of earlier examples.

# Quickstart Examples

**Hello World! (~10 minutes)**

- Deploy a `hello world!` component using the Pipedream CLI and invoke it manually
- Use `$.service.db` to maintain state across invocations
- Use `$.interface.timer` to invoke a component on a schedule
- Use `$.interface.http` to invoke code on HTTP requests

**Emit new RSS items on a schedule (~10 mins)**

- Use the `rss-parser` npm package to retrieve an RSS feed and emit each item
- Display a custom summary for each emitted item in the event list
- Use the `unique` deduping strategy so we only emit new items from the RSS feed
- Add a timer interface to run the component on a schedule

**Poll for new Github issues (~10 mins)**

- Use Pipedream managed OAuth with Github's API to retrieve issues for a repo
- Use the `greatest` deduping strategy to only emit new issues

# Prerequisites

**Step 1.** Create a free account at [https://pipedream.com](https://pipedream.com). Just sign in with your Google or Github account.

**Step 2.** [Download and install the Pipedream CLI](/cli/install/).

**Step 3.** Once the CLI is installed, [link your Pipedream account to the CLI](/cli/login/#existing-pipedream-account):

```bash
pd login
```

See the [CLI reference](/cli/reference/) for detailed usage and examples beyond those covered below.

# CLI Development Mode

The examples in this guide use the `pd dev` command. This command will deploy your code in "development mode". What that means is that the CLI will attach to the deployed component and watch your local file for changes — when you save changes to your local file, your component will automatically be updated on Pipedream (the alternative is to `pd deploy` and run `pd update` for each change).

If your `pd dev` session is terminated and you need to re-attach to a deployed component, run the following command.

```bash
pd dev [--dc <existing-deployed-component-id>] <file-or-name>
```

See the [CLI reference](/cli/reference/) for detailed usage and examples beyond those covered below.

# Hello World!

Here is a simple component that will emit an event with a payload of `{ message: "hello world!" }` on each invocation.

```javascript
export default {
  name: "Source Demo",
  description: "This is a demo source",
  async run() {
    this.$emit({ message: "hello world!" });
  },
};
```

To deploy and run it, save the code to a local `.js` file (e.g., `source.js`) and run the following CLI command:

```bash
pd dev source.js
```

The CLI will deploy your code in development mode (the CLI will attach to the deployed component and watch your local file for changes — when you save changes to your local file, your component will automatically be updated on Pipedream).

You should see the following output:

```bash
$ pd dev source.js
watch:add     | source.js
Configuring props...
Deploying...
Attached to deployed component: https://pipedream.com/sources/dc_v3uXKz/configuration
Ready for updates!
```

Open the URL returned by the CLI (`https://pipedream.com/sources/dc_v3uXKz` in the sample output above) to view your source in Pipedream's UI.

Then click **RUN NOW** to invoke your source. Your event will appear in real-time, and you can select it to inspect the emitted data.

### Maintain state across invocations

Next, we'll use Pipedream's `db` service to track the number of times the component is invoked.

First, we'll assign `$.service.db` to a prop so we can reference it in our code via `this`.

```javascript
props: {
  db: "$.service.db",
},
```

Then we'll update the `run()` method to:

- Retrieve the value for the `count` key (using the `get()` method of `$.service.db`)
- Display the count in the event summary (event summaries are displayed in the event list next to the event time)
- Increment `count` and save the updated value to `$.service.db` using the `set()` method

```javascript
let count = this.db.get("count") || 1;

this.$emit(
  { message: "hello world!" },
  {
    summary: `Invocation #${count}`,
  }
);

this.db.set("count", ++count);
```

Here's the updated code:

```javascript
export default {
  name: "Source Demo",
  description: "This is a demo source",
  props: {
    db: "$.service.db",
  },
  async run() {
    let count = this.db.get("count") || 1;

    this.$emit(
      { message: "hello world!" },
      {
        summary: `Invocation #${count}`,
      }
    );

    this.db.set("count", ++count);
  },
};
```

Save the changes to your local file. Your component on Pipedream should automatically update. Return to the Pipedream UI and press **RUN NOW** — you should see the invocation count appear in the event list.

![source](./images/quickstart/hello-world-2.gif)

### Invoke your code on a schedule

Next, we'll update our component so it runs on a schedule. To do that, we'll use Pipedream's `timer` interface and we'll set the default execution interval to 15 seconds by adding the following code to props:

```
timer: {
  type: "$.interface.timer",
  default: {
    intervalSeconds: 15,
  },
},
```

Here's the updated code:

```javascript
export default {
  name: "Source Demo",
  description: "This is a demo source",
  props: {
    db: "$.service.db",
    timer: {
      type: "$.interface.timer",
      default: {
        intervalSeconds: 15,
      },
    },
  },
  async run() {
    let count = this.db.get("count") || 1;

    this.$emit(
      { message: "hello world!" },
      {
        summary: `Invocation #${count}`,
      }
    );

    this.db.set("count", ++count);
  },
};
```

Save the changes to your file (your component on Pipedream should automatically update). and then, return to the Pipedream UI and **reload the page**. You should now see the timer settings in the summary and a countdown to the next execution (you can still run your component manually). Your component will now run every 15 seconds.

![source](./images/quickstart/hello-world-3.gif)

**Note**: if you'd like to change the schedule of your deployed component, visit the **Configuration** tab in the Pipedream UI and change the schedule accordingly. Changing the value of `intervalSeconds` within the component's code will not change the schedule of the running instance of the component. You can also set one value as the default `intervalSeconds` in the component's code, but run

```bash
pd dev --prompt-all <your-file.js>
```

to set a different schedule than the default specified in the code.

### Invoke your code on HTTP requests

Next, we'll update our component to run on HTTP requests instead of a timer. To do that, we'll just replace the `timer` interface with an `http` interface.

```javascript
http: { 
        type: "$.interface.http", 
        customResponse: true 
      },
```

In addition, we'll update the function signature to pass in the HTTP event so we can reference it in our code:

```javascript
async run(event) {
```

Finally, let's update the `run()` method to use `event` to both echo back the request body in the HTTP response and emit it as the event payload.

```javascript
this.http.respond({
  status: 200,
  body: event.body,
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": event.headers["Content-Type"],
  },
});

this.$emit(event.body, {
  summary: `Invocation #${count}`,
});
```

Here's the updated code:

```javascript
export default {
  name: "Source Demo",
  description: "This is a demo source",
  props: {
    db: "$.service.db",
    http: {
      type: "$.interface.http",
      customResponse: true
    },
  },
  async run(event) {
    let count = this.db.get("count") || 1;

    this.http.respond({
      status: 200,
      body: event.body,
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": event.headers["Content-Type"],
      },
    });

    this.$emit(event.body, {
      summary: `Invocation #${count}`,
    });

    this.db.set("count", ++count);
  },
};
```

Save the changes to your file and your component on Pipedream should automatically update.

Return to the Pipedream UI and refresh the page. Instead of the countdown timer, you will now see a unique URL generated by Pipedream. Copy the URL and update and execute the CURL command below to invoke your component. This command passes `{ message: "hello world!" }` as the request body. `{ message: "hello world!" }` will be emitted as the event similar to the earlier examples, and it will also be echoed back in the HTTP response.

```
curl -d '{ "message": "hello world!" }' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "INSERT-YOUR-ENDPOINT-URL-HERE"
```

# Emit new RSS items on a schedule (~10 mins)

Next, let's cover some real-world examples starting with RSS. Continue editing the same file, but start with the following scaffolding for this example.

```javascript
export default {
  name: "Source Demo",
  description: "This is a demo source",
  async run() {},
};
```

## Emit items in an RSS Feed

> **Note:** The code for the examples below was adapted from the samples provided in the readme for the `rss-parser` package at https://www.npmjs.com/package/rss-parser. To use most npm packages on Pipedream, just `import` them — there is no `package.json` or `npm install` required.

To parse the RSS feed, we'll use the `rss-parser` npm package.

```javascript
import Parser from "rss-parser";
let parser = new Parser();
```

Then, update the `run()` method to:

- Parse the feed at `https://lorem-rss.herokuapp.com/feed` (it's important you use this feed -- a new item is added every minute, so it will help us test deduplication)
- Loop through the array of returned RSS items and emit each one

```javascript
let feed = await parser.parseURL("https://lorem-rss.herokuapp.com/feed");
feed.items.forEach((item) => {
  this.$emit(item);
});
```

Here's the updated code:

```javascript
import Parser from "rss-parser";
let parser = new Parser();

export default {
  name: "Source Demo",
  description: "This is a demo source",
  async run() {
    let feed = await parser.parseURL("https://lorem-rss.herokuapp.com/feed");
    feed.items.forEach((item) => {
      this.$emit(item);
    });
  },
};
```

Save the changes to your file, and then refresh your source in the Pipedream UI and click **RUN NOW**. You should see 10 events emitted. Each event corresponds with an RSS item. You can select each event to inspect it.

## Add an optional summary for each emitted event

Next, we'll add a summary for each event. The summary is displayed in the event list and makes it easy to differentiate events at a glance in the list. For this example, let's emit the `title` as the summary for each RSS item. To do that, we add a metadata object to `this.$emit()`.

Add summary to emit metadata...

```javascript
this.$emit(item, {
  summary: item.title,
});
```

Here's the updated code:

```javascript
import Parser from "rss-parser";
let parser = new Parser();

export default {
  name: "Source Demo",
  description: "This is a demo source",
  async run() {
    let feed = await parser.parseURL("https://lorem-rss.herokuapp.com/feed");
    feed.items.forEach((item) => {
      this.$emit(item, {
        summary: item.title,
      });
    });
  },
};
```

Save the changes to your file and then click **RUN NOW** in the Pipedream UI. You should again see 10 events emitted, but this time each event should have a corresponding summary in the event list.

## Only Emit New Items in the RSS Feed

In the previous examples, we always emit any data that is returned. However, we are emitting duplicate events -- e.g., if you run invoke the component twice, you will see the same events emitted twice.

Pipedream provides built-in deduplication strategies to make it easy to emit new events only. For this example, we'll use the `unique` strategy. This strategy caches the last 100 event `id` values, and only emits events with `id` values that are not contained in that cache.

To dedupe with the `unique` strategy, we need to first declare it:

```javascript
dedupe: "unique",
```

And then we need to pass an `id` value in the metadata for `this.$emit()` for Pipedream to use for deduping:

```javascript
this.$emit(item, {
  summary: item.title,
  id: item.guid,
});
```

Here's the updated code:

```javascript
import Parser from "rss-parser";
let parser = new Parser();

export default {
  name: "Source Demo",
  description: "This is a demo source",
  dedupe: "unique",
  async run() {
    let feed = await parser.parseURL("https://lorem-rss.herokuapp.com/feed");
    feed.items.forEach((item) => {
      this.$emit(item, {
        summary: item.title,
        id: item.guid,
      });
    });
  },
};
```

Save the changes to your file and then click **RUN NOW** in the Pipedream UI. Similar to previous invocations, you should see 10 events emitted. Now, run the component **again**. You should see a maximum of **one, if any** events emitted (the reason one event may be emitted is if a new item was added to the RSS feed). If no new events were emitted, wait for ~1 minute and try again.

## Add a timer interface to invoke the component on a schedule

Now we're ready to add a timer to our component to check for new RSS items automatically. Similar to the **hello world!** example above, we'll add a timer prop, and we'll set the default interval to 5 minutes:

```javascript
props: {
  timer: {
    type: "$.interface.timer",
    default: {
      intervalSeconds: 60 * 5,
    },
  },
},
```

Here's the updated code:

```javascript
import Parser from "rss-parser";
let parser = new Parser();

export default {
  name: "Source Demo",
  description: "This is a demo source",
  props: {
    timer: {
      type: "$.interface.timer",
      default: {
        intervalSeconds: 60 * 5,
      },
    },
  },
  dedupe: "unique",
  async run() {
    let feed = await parser.parseURL("https://lorem-rss.herokuapp.com/feed");
    feed.items.forEach((item) => {
      this.$emit(item, {
        id: item.guid,
        summary: item.title,
      });
    });
  },
};
```

**Save** your component then return to the UI and reload the page. You should see the updated configuration on your summary card and a countdown to the next invocation. You can still click **RUN NOW** to execute your source manually.

# Use managed auth to pull data from Github (~10 mins)

In the last example, we were able to retrieve data to emit without any authentication. Now we'll use Pipedream managed auth to retrieve and emit data from the Github API (which uses OAuth for authentication). Similar to the last example, continue editing the same file, but start with the following scaffolding:

```javascript
export default {
  name: "Source Demo",
  description: "This is a demo source",
  async run() {},
};
```

## Get issues for a repo

First, import `axios` so we can make a request to the Github REST API:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";
```

Next, let's add an **app prop**, which will enable us to use Pipedream managed auth with this component. For this example, we'll add Github:

```javascript
props: {
  github: {
    type: "app",
    app: "github",
  },
},
```

**IMPORTANT: The CLI will prompt you to select a connected account (or connect a new one) when you deploy (or update) this component.**

> **Note:** The value for the `app` property is the name slug for the app in Pipedream. This is not currently discoverable, but it will be in the near future. For the time being, if you want to know how to reference an app, please reach out on our public Slack.

Finally, we'll update the `run()` method to fetch issues from Github using `axios` and emit them. Notice that we're passing the `oauth_access_token` in the authorization header by referencing the app prop `this.github.$auth.oauth_access_token`. Again, it's important that you stick with the `pddemo/demo` repo shown in the below example so you can test the next dedupe strategy.

```javascript
async run() {
  const response = await axios({
    method: 'get',
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${this.github.$auth.oauth_access_token}`,
    },
    url: `https://api.github.com/repos/pddemo/demo/issues`
  })
  response.data.forEach(issue => {
    this.$emit(issue)
  })
}
```

Here's the updated code.

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

export default {
  name: "Source Demo",
  description: "This is a demo source",
  props: {
    github: {
      type: "app",
      app: "github",
    },
  },
  async run() {
    const response = await axios({
      method: "get",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${this.github.$auth.oauth_access_token}`,
      },
      url: `https://api.github.com/repos/pddemo/demo/issues`,
    });
    response.data.forEach((issue) => {
      this.$emit(issue);
    });
  },
};
```

Next save your changes and go to the terminal where you ran `pd dev` **— follow the CLI prompts to select a connected account for Github (or connect a new one)**. Then load the Pipedream UI, and click **RUN NOW**. Your component should emit 30 issues.

## Dedupe the events

In the RSS example, we deduped the emitted events based on the `unique` strategy. The limitation of the unique strategy is that it will only maintain uniqueness for 100 items. Since Github issues have increasing numeric IDs, we can use the `greatest` strategy to filter for new issues.

To use this strategy, we first have to declare it.

```javascript
dedupe: "greatest".
```

Then, we need to pass the numeric ID for each issue to `this.$emit()`. We can also add a summary and a timestamp (based on the date/time when the issue was created). Note: when you add a timestamp, Pipedream will automatically emit events from oldest to newest.

```javascript
response.data.forEach((issue) => {
  this.$emit(issue, {
    id: issue.id,
    summary: `ISSUE ${issue.number}: ${issue.title}`,
    ts: issue.created_at && +new Date(issue.created_at),
  });
});
```

Here is the updated code.

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

export default {
  name: "Source Demo",
  description: "This is a demo source",
  props: {
    github: {
      type: "app",
      app: "github",
    },
  },
  dedupe: "greatest",
  async run() {
    const response = await axios({
      method: "get",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${this.github.$auth.oauth_access_token}`,
      },
      url: `https://api.github.com/repos/pddemo/demo/issues`,
    });
    response.data.forEach((issue) => {
      this.$emit(issue, {
        id: issue.id,
        summary: `ISSUE ${issue.number}: ${issue.title}`,
        ts: issue.created_at && +new Date(issue.created_at),
      });
    });
  },
};
```

Save, load the Pipedream UI, and click **RUN NOW**. You should see 30 issues emitted, now with summaries. When you click **RUN NOW** again, only new issues will be emitted (if there are any).

## Add a timer to run on a schedule

As the final step of this walk-through, we'll update our component to check for new issues every 15 minutes. To do that, we'll add a timer prop.

```javascript
timer: {
  type: "$.interface.timer",
  default: {
    intervalSeconds: 60 * 15,
  },
},
```

Here's the updated code.

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

export default {
  name: "Source Demo",
  description: "This is a demo source",
  props: {
    github: {
      type: "app",
      app: "github",
    },
    timer: {
      type: "$.interface.timer",
      default: {
        intervalSeconds: 60 * 15,
      },
    },
  },
  dedupe: "greatest",
  async run() {
    const response = await axios({
      method: "get",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${this.github.$auth.oauth_access_token}`,
      },
      url: `https://api.github.com/repos/pddemo/demo/issues`,
    });
    response.data.forEach((issue) => {
      this.$emit(issue, {
        id: issue.id,
        summary: `ISSUE ${issue.number}: ${issue.title}`,
        ts: issue.created_at && +new Date(issue.created_at),
      });
    });
  },
};
```

Save and reload your source in the Pipedream UI. You should now see a countdown timer to the next execution.
