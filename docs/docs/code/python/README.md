# Python

**Anything you can do in Python can be done in a Pipedream Workflow**. This includes using any of the [350,000+ PyPi packages available](https://pypi.org/) in your Python powered workflows. 

Pipedream supports [Python v{{$site.themeConfig.PYTHON_VERSION}}](https://www.python.org) in workflows.

::: warning
Python steps are available in a limited alpha release.

You can still run arbitrary Python code, including [sharing data between steps](/code/python/#sharing-data-between-steps), [send API requests using connected accounts](/code/python/auth/), [use Data Stores](/code/python/using-data-stores/), and [accessing environment variables](/code/python/#using-environment-variables).

However, you can't delay or retry steps, or take advantage of other features available in the [Node.js](/code/nodejs/) environment at this time. If you have any questions please [contact support](https://pipedream.com/support).

## Adding a Python code step

1. Click the + icon to add a new step
2. Click **Custom Code**
3. In the new step, select the `python` language runtime in language dropdown

## Python Code Step Structure

A new Python Code step will have the following structure, with a `handler` method and a `pd` argument passed into it:

```python

def handler(pd: "pipedream"):
  # Exports a variable called message with contents "Hello, World!"
  pd.export("message", "Hello, World!")

```

The `handler` method is called during the step's execution, and the `pd` object contains helper methods to [use Data Stores](/code/python/using-data-stores/) and make [authenticated API requests to apps](/code/python/auth/).

* [Import data exported from other steps](/code/python/#using-data-from-another-step)
* [Export data to downstream steps](/code/python/#sending-data-downstream-to-other-steps)
* [Retrieve data from a data store](/code/python/using-data-stores/#retrieving-data)
* [Store data into a data store](/code/python/using-data-stores/#saving-data)
* [Access API credentials from connected accounts](/code/python/auth/)

## Logging and debugging

You can use `print` at any time in a Python code step to log information as the script is running.

The output for the `print` **logs** will appear in the `Results` section just beneath the code editor.

## Using third party packages

You can use any packages from [PyPi](https://pypi.org) in your Pipedream workflows. This includes popular choices such as:

* [`requests` for making HTTP requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
* [`sqlalchemy`for retrieving or inserting data in a SQL database](https://pypi.org/project/sqlalchemy/)
* [`pandas` for working with complex datasets](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)

To use a PyPi package, just include it in your step's code:

```python
import requests
```

And that's it.

No need to update a `requirements.txt` or specify elsewhere in your workflow of which packages you need. Pipedream will automatically install the dependency for you.

### If your package's `import` name differs from its PyPI package name

Pipedream's package installation uses [the `pipreqs` package](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs) to detect package imports and install the associated package for you. Some packages, like [`python-telegram-bot`](https://python-telegram-bot.org/), use an `import` name that differs from their PyPI name:

```bash
pip install python-telegram-bot
```

vs.

```python
import telegram
```

Use the built in [magic comment system to resolve these mismatches](/code/python/import-mappings/):

```python
# pipedream add-package python-telegram-bot

import telegram
```

## Making an HTTP request

We recommend using the popular `requests` HTTP client package available in Python to send HTTP requests.

No need to run `pip install`, just `import requests` at the top of your step's code and it's available for your code to use.

### Making a `GET` request

GET requests typically are for retrieving data from an API. Below is an example.

```python
import requests

def handler(pd: "pipedream"):
  url = 'https://swapi.dev/api/people/1'

  r = requests.get(url)

  # The response is logged in your Pipedream step results:
  print(r.text)

  # The response status code is logged in your Pipedream step results:
  print(r.status)
```

### Making a POST request

```python
import requests

def handler(pd: "pipedream"):
  # This a POST request to this URL will echo back whatever data we send to it
  url = 'https://postman-echo.com/post'

  data = {"name": "Bulbasaur"}

  r = requests.post(url, data)

  # The response is logged in your Pipedream step results:
  print(r.text)

  # The response status code is logged in your Pipedream step results:
  print(r.status)
```

### Sending files

You can also send files within a step.

An example of sending a previously stored file in the workflow's `/tmp` directory: 

```python
import requests

def handler(pd: "pipedream"):
  # Retrieving a previously saved file from workflow storage
  files = {'image': open('/tmp/python-logo.png', 'rb')}

  r = requests.post(url='https://api.imgur.com/3/image', files=files)
```




## Returning HTTP responses

You can return HTTP responses from [HTTP-triggered workflows](/workflows/steps/triggers/#http) using the `pd.respond()` method:

```python
def handler(pd: 'pipedream'):
  pd.respond({
    'status': 200,
    'body': {
      'message': 'Everything is ok'
    }
  })
```

Please note to always include at least the `body` and `status` keys in your `pd.respond` argument. The `body` must also be a JSON serializable object or dictionary.

:::warning

Unlike the [Node.js equivalent](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/steps/triggers/#http-responses), the Python `pd.respond` helper does not yet support responding with Streams.

:::

:::tip
*Don't forget* to [configure your workflow's HTTP trigger to allow a custom response](/workflows/steps/triggers/#http-responses). Otherwise your workflow will return the default response.
:::

## Sharing data between steps

A step can accept data from other steps in the same workflow, or pass data downstream to others.

### Using data from another step

In Python steps, data from the initial workflow trigger and other steps are available in the `pd.steps` object.

In this example, we'll pretend this data is coming into our workflow's HTTP trigger via POST request.

```json
// POST <our-workflows-endpoint>.m.pipedream.net
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Bulbasaur",
  "type": "plant"
}
```

In our Python step, we can access this data in the `exports` variable from the `pd.steps` object passed into the `handler`. Specifically, this data from the POST request into our workflow is available in the `trigger` dictionary item. 

```python
def handler(pd: "pipedream"):
  # retrieve the data from the HTTP request in the initial workflow trigger 
  pokemon_name = pd.steps["trigger"]["event"]["name"]
  pokemon_type = pd.steps["trigger"]["event"]["type"]

  print(f"{pokemon_name} is a {pokemon_type} type Pokemon")
```

### Sending data downstream to other steps

To share data created, retrieved, transformed or manipulated by a step to others downstream call the `pd.export` method:

```python
# This step is named "code" in the workflow

def handler(pd: "pipedream"):
  r = requests.get("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/charizard")
  # Store the JSON contents into a variable called "pokemon"
  pokemon = r.json()

  # Expose the data to other steps in the "pokemon" key from this step
  pd.export('pokemon', pokemon)
```

Now this `pokemon` data is accessible to downstream steps within `pd.steps["code"]["pokemon"]`

::: warning
You can only export JSON-serializable data from steps. Things like:

* strings
* numbers
* lists 
* dictionaries
:::

## Using environment variables

You can leverage any [environment variables defined in your Pipedream account](/environment-variables/#environment-variables) in a Python step. This is useful for keeping your secrets out of code as well as keeping them flexible to swap API keys without having to update each step individually.

To access them, use the `os` module.

```python
import os
import requests

def handler(pd: "pipedream"):
  token = os.environ['TWITTER_API_KEY']

  print(token)
```

Or an even more useful example, using the stored environment variable to make an authenticated API request.

### Using API key authentication

If an particular service requires you to use an API key, you can pass it via the headers of the request.

This proves your identity to the service so you can interact with it:

```python
import requests
import os

def handler(pd: "pipedream"):
  token = os.environ['TWITTER_API_KEY']

  url = 'https://api.twitter.com/2/users/@pipedream/mentions'

  headers { 'Authorization': f"Bearer {token}"}
  r = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

  print(r.text)
```

:::tip
There are 2 different ways of using the `os` module to access your environment variables.

`os.environ['ENV_NAME_HERE']` will raise an error that stops your workflow if that key doesn't exist in your Pipedream account.

Whereas `os.environ.get('ENV_NAME_HERE')` will _not_ throw an error and instead returns an empty string. 

If your code relies on the presence of a environment variable, consider using `os.environ['ENV_NAME_HERE']` instead.
:::

## Handling errors

You may need to exit a workflow early. In a Python step, just a `raise` an error to halt a step's execution.


```python
raise NameError('Something happened that should not. Exiting early.')
```

All exceptions from your Python code will appear in the **logs** area of the results.

## Ending a workflow early

Sometimes you want to end your workflow early, or otherwise stop or cancel the execution of a workflow under certain conditions. For example:

- You may want to end your workflow early if you don't receive all the fields you expect in the event data.
- You only want to run your workflow for 5% of all events sent from your source.
- You only want to run your workflow for users in the United States. If you receive a request from outside the U.S., you don't want the rest of the code in your workflow to run.
- You may use the `user_id` contained in the event to look up information in an external API. If you can't find data in the API tied to that user, you don't want to proceed.

**In any code step, calling `pd.flow.exit()` will end the execution of the workflow immediately.** No remaining code in that step, and no code or destination steps below, will run for the current event.

```python
def handler(pd: 'pipedream'):
  return pd.flow.exit()
  print("This code will not run, since pd.flow.exit() was called above it")
```

You can pass any string as an argument to `pd.flow.exit()`:

```python
def handler(pd: 'pipedream'):
  return pd.flow.exit('Exiting early. Goodbye.')
  print("This code will not run, since pd.flow.exit() was called above it")
```

Or exit the workflow early within a conditional:

```python
def handler(pd: 'pipedream'):
  # Flip a coin, running $.flow.exit() for 50% of events
  if random.randint(0, 100) <= 50:
    return pd.flow.exit()
  
  print("This code will only run 50% of the time");
```

## File storage

You can also store and read files with Python steps. This means you can upload photos, retrieve datasets, accept files from an HTTP request and more.

The `/tmp` directory is accessible from your workflow steps for saving and retrieving files.

You have full access to read and write both files in `/tmp`. 

### Writing a file to /tmp

```python
import requests

def handler(pd: "pipedream"):
  # Download the Python logo
  r = requests.get('https://www.python.org/static/img/python-logo@2x.png')

  # Create a new file python-logo.png in the /tmp/data directory
  with open('/tmp/python-logo.png', 'wb') as f:
    # Save the content of the HTTP response into the file
    f.write(r.content)
```

Now `/tmp/python-logo.png` holds the official Python logo.

### Reading a file from /tmp

You can also open files you have previously stored in the `/tmp` directory. Let's open the `python-logo.png` file.

```python
import os

def handler(pd: "pipedream"):
  with open('/tmp/python-logo.png') as f:
    # Store the contents of the file into a variable
    file_data = f.read()
```

### Listing files in /tmp

If you need to check what files are currently in `/tmp` you can list them and print the results to the **Logs** section of **Results**:

```python
import os

def handler(pd: "pipedream"):
  # Prints the files in the tmp directory
  print(os.listdir('/tmp'))
```

:::warning
The `/tmp` directory does not have unlimited storage. Please refer to the [disk limits](/limits/#disk) for details.
