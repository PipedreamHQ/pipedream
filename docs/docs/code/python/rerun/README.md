# Pause, resume, and rerun a workflow

You can use `pd.flow.suspend` and `pd.flow.rerun` to pause a workflow and resume it later. 

This is useful when you want to:

- Pause a workflow until someone manually approves it
- Poll an external API until some job completes, and proceed with the workflow when it's done
- Trigger an external API to start a job, pause the workflow, and resume it when the external API sends an HTTP callback

We'll cover all of these examples below.

## `pd.flow.suspend`

Use `pd.flow.suspend` when you want to pause a workflow and proceed with the remaining steps only when manually approved or cancelled.

For example, you can suspend a workflow and send yourself a link to manually resume or cancel the rest of the workflow:

```python
def handler(pd: 'pipedream'):
    urls = pd.flow.suspend()
    pd.send.email(
      subject="Please approve this important workflow",
      text=f"Click here to approve the workflow: ${urls["resume_url"]}, and cancel here: ${urls["cancel_url"]}"
    )
    # Pipedream suspends your workflow at the end of the step
```

You'll receive an email like this:

<div>
  <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1655272047/docs/approve-workflow_oc06k3.png" alt="approve this workflow" width="100%"/>
</div>

And can resume or cancel the rest of the workflow by clicking on the appropriate link.

### `resume_url` and `cancel_url`

In general, calling `pd.flow.suspend` returns a `cancel_url` and `resume_url` that lets you cancel or resume paused executions. Since Pipedream pauses your workflow at the _end_ of the step, you can pass these URLs to any external service before the workflow pauses. If that service accepts a callback URL, it can trigger the `resume_url` when its work is complete.

These URLs are specific to a single execution of your workflow. While the workflow is paused, you can load these in your browser or send any HTTP request to them:

- Sending an HTTP request to the `cancel_url` will cancel that execution
- Sending an HTTP request to the `resume_url` will resume that execution

If you resume a workflow, any data sent in the HTTP request is passed to the workflow and returned in the `$resume_data` [step export](/workflows/steps/#step-exports) of the suspended step. For example, if you call `pd.flow.suspend` within a step named `code`, the `$resume_data` export should contain the data sent in the `resume_url` request:

</div>

### Default timeout of 24 hours 

By default, `pd.flow.suspend` will automatically resume the workflow after 24 hours. You can set your own timeout (in milliseconds) as the first argument:

```python
def handler(pd: 'pipedream'):
    # 7 days
    TIMEOUT = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7
    pd.flow.suspend(TIMEOUT)
```

## `pd.flow.rerun`

Use `pd.flow.rerun` when you want to run a specific step of a workflow multiple times. This is useful when you need to start a job in an external API and poll for its completion, or have the service call back to the step and let you process the HTTP request within the step.

### Polling for the status of an external job

Sometimes you need to poll for the status of an external job until it completes. `pd.flow.rerun` lets you rerun a specific step multiple times:

```python
import requests

def handler(pd: 'pipedream'):
  MAX_RETRIES = 3
  # 10 seconds
  DELAY = 1000 * 10
  run = pd.context['run']
  print(pd.context)
  # pd.context.run.runs starts at 1 and increments when the step is rerun
  if run['runs'] == 1:
    # pd.flow.rerun(delay, context (discussed below), max retries)
    pd.flow.rerun(DELAY, None, MAX_RETRIES)
  
  elif run['runs'] == MAX_RETRIES + 1:
    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
  
  else:
    # Poll external API for status
    response = requests.get("https://example.com/status")
    # If we're done, continue with the rest of the workflow
    if response.json().status == "DONE":
      return response.json()

    # Else retry later
    pd.flow.rerun(DELAY, None, MAX_RETRIES)
```

`$.flow.rerun` accepts the following arguments:

```python
pd.flow.rerun(
  delay, # The number of milliseconds until the step will be rerun
  context, # JSON-serializable data you need to pass between runs
  maxRetries, # The total number of times the step will rerun. Defaults to 10
)
```

### Accept an HTTP callback from an external service

When you trigger a job in an external service, and that service can send back data in an HTTP callback to Pipedream, you can process that data within the same step using `pd.flow.retry`:

```python
import requests

def handler(pd: 'pipedream'):
  TIMEOUT = 86400 * 1000
  run = pd.context['run']
  # pd.context['run']['runs'] starts at 1 and increments when the step is rerun
  if run['runs'] == 1:
    links = pd.flow.rerun(TIMEOUT, None, 1)
    # links contains a dictionary with two entries: resume_url and cancel_url

    # Send resume_url to external service
    await request.post("your callback URL", json=links)
  elif run['runs'] == 2:
    raise Exception("External service never completed job")

  # When the external service calls back into the resume_url, you have access to 
  # the callback data within pd.context.run['callback_request']
  else:
    return run['callback_request']

```

### Passing `context` to `pd.flow.rerun`

Within a Python code step, `pd.context.run.context` contains the `context` passed from the prior call to `rerun`. This lets you pass data from one run to another. For example, if you call:

```python
pd.flow.rerun(1000, { "hello": "world" })
```

`$.context.run.context` will contain:

<div>
  <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1655274732/docs/Screen_Shot_2022-06-14_at_11.32.06_PM_dmzgkh.png" alt="resume data step export" width="250px"/>
</div>

### `maxRetries`

By default, `maxRetries` is **10**.

When you exceed `maxRetries`, the workflow proceeds to the next step. If you need to handle this case with an exception, `raise` an Exception from the step:

```python
def handler(pd: 'pipedream'):
  MAX_RETRIES = 3
  run = pd.context['run']
  if run['runs'] == 1:
    pd.flow.rerun(1000, None, MAX_RETRIES)

  else if (run['runs'] == MAX_RETRIES + 1):
    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

## Behavior when testing

When you're building a workflow and test a step with `pd.flow.suspend` or `pd.flow.rerun`, it will not suspend the workflow, and you'll see a message like the following:

> Workflow execution canceled â€” this may be due to `pd.flow.suspend()` usage (not supported in test)

These functions will only suspend and resume when run in production.

## Credits usage when using `pd.flow.suspend` / `pd.flow.rerun`

You are not charged for the time your workflow is suspended during a `pd.flow.suspend` or `pd.flow.rerun`. Only when workflows are resumed will compute time count toward [credit usage](/pricing/#credits).

::: warning

When a suspended workflow reawakens, it will reset the credit counter.

Each rerun or reawakening from a suspension will count as a new fresh credit.
