# Delaying a workflow in Node.js

<VideoPlayer title="Delaying Workflow Steps" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IBORwBnIZ-k" startAt="148" />

Use `$.flow.delay` to [delay a step in a workflow](/workflows/built-in-functions/#delay).

These docs show you how write Node.js code to handle delays. If you don't need to write code, see [our built-in delay actions](/workflows/built-in-functions/#delay-actions).

## Using `$.flow.delay`

`$.flow.delay` takes one argument: the number of **milliseconds** you'd like to pause your workflow until the next step executes. {{$site.themeConfig.DELAY_MIN_MAX_TIME}}. 

Note that [delays happen at the end of the step where they're called](#when-delays-happen).

```javascript
export default defineComponent({
  async run({ steps, $ }) {
    // Delay a workflow for 60 seconds (60,000 ms)
    $.flow.delay(60 * 1000)

    // Delay a workflow for 15 minutes
    $.flow.delay(15 * 60 * 1000)

    // Delay a workflow based on the value of incoming event data,
    // or default to 60 seconds if that variable is undefined
    $.flow.delay(steps.trigger.event?.body?.delayMs ?? 60 * 1000)

    // Delay a workflow a random amount of time
    $.flow.delay(Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000))
  })
});
```

## `cancel_url` and `resume_url`

Both the built-in **Delay** actions and `$.flow.delay` return a `cancel_url` and `resume_url` that lets you cancel or resume paused executions.

These URLs are specific to a single execution of your workflow. While the workflow is paused, you can load these in your browser or send an HTTP request to either:

- Hitting the `cancel_url` will immediately cancel that execution
- Hitting the `resume_url` will immediately resume that execution early

[Since Pipedream pauses your workflow at the _end_ of the step where you run call `$.flow.delay`](#when-delays-happen), you can send these URLs to third party systems, via email, or anywhere else you'd like to control the execution of your workflow.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios'

export default defineComponent({
  async run({ steps, $ }) {
    const { cancel_url, resume_url } = $.flow.delay(15 * 60 * 1000)

    // Send the URLs to a system you own
    await axios({
      method: "POST",
      url: `https://example.com`,
      data: { cancel_url, resume_url },
    });

    // Email yourself the URLs. Click on the links to cancel / resume
    $.send.email({
      subject: `Workflow execution ${steps.trigger.context.id}`,
      text: `Cancel your workflow here: ${cancel_url} . Resume early here: ${resume_url}`,
    });
  })
});

// Delay happens at the end of this step
```

## When delays happen

**Pipedream pauses your workflow at the _end_ of the step where you call `$.flow.delay`**. This lets you [send the `cancel_url` and `resume_url` to third-party systems](#cancel-url-and-resume-url).

```javascript
export default defineComponent({
  async run({ steps, $ }) {
    const { cancel_url, resume_url } = $.flow.delay(15 * 60 * 1000)
    // ... run any code you want here
  })
});

// Delay happens at the end of this step
```
