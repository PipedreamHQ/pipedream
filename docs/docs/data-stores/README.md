# Data Stores

**Data stores** are key-value databases to easily set and get any JSON serializable data and maintain state across workflow executions.

It's useful for counting values, or summing up data between run, or tracking unique data points like email addresses and much more.

Data stores are:

* Persisted between workflow runs
* Shareable between workflows
* Don't require any setup or external connections

You can also use native pre-built actions to store, update, clear data without code.
