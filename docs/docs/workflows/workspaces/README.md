# Workspaces

When registering a Pipedream account, you're prompted to create a workspace. Workflows are organized and contained within your workspace.

Workspaces are a container for your projects and workflows, and can be shared with your team members.

## Projects

A workspace can contain one or more _projects_. Projects are a way to organize your workflows into specific groupings or categories.

::: details How do I limit workspace members from viewing or developing workflows in certain projects?

Members of a given workspace can see all projects in the workspace. 

If you need to limit certain project's visibility to only some members, then those members belong in a different workspace.

### Creating Projects

To create a new project, first [open the Projects section in the dashboard](https://pipedream.com/projects).

Then click **Create project** to start a new project.
