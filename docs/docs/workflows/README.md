# What are workflows?

[**Follow our quickstart to build your first workflow**](/quickstart/).

Workflows make it easy to integrate your apps, data, and APIs — all with no servers or infrastructure to manage.

- Workflows are composed of code that is organized and executed as a sequence of linear [**steps**](/docs/workflows/steps).

- Trigger your workflow on any event (e.g., [HTTP requests](/workflows/steps/triggers/#http) or a [schedule](/workflows/steps/triggers/#schedule)).

- Add steps to run Node.js [code](/workflows/steps/code/) (using virtually any [`npm`](/workflows/steps/code/#using-npm-packages) package) and [prebuilt actions](/components/actions/).

- Steps are executed in the order they appear in your workflow.

- Export values for each step and access them via the `steps` object.

Workflow code is private by default, but you can [make the code of any workflow public](/public-workflows/) so others can discover and [copy it](/workflows/copy/). If you make the code of a workflow public, your workflow execution and event data will still remain **private**.

## Get started

It takes less than 5 minutes to write your first workflow. [Follow our quickstart to get started](/quickstart/).
