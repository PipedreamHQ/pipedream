# What are Workflows?

[**Follow our quickstart to build your first workflow**](/quickstart/).

Workflows make it easy to integrate your apps, data, and APIs - all with no servers or infrastructure to manage.

- Workflows are composed of code that is organized and executed as a sequence of linear [**steps**](/docs/workflows/steps/).

- Trigger your workflow on any event (e.g., [HTTP requests](/workflows/steps/triggers/#http) or a [schedule](/workflows/steps/triggers/#schedule)).

- Add steps to run Node.js [code](/workflows/steps/code/) (using virtually any [`npm`](/workflows/steps/code/#using-npm-packages) package) and [prebuilt actions](/components/actions/).

- Steps are executed in the order they appear in your workflow.

- Export values for each step and access them via the `steps` object.
