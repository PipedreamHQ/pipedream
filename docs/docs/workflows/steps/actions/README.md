# Actions (legacy)

::: danger
There is a [new version](https://pipedream.com/community/t/actions-improved-open-source-now-in-beta/606) of Pipedream Actions available.  Legacy Actions will be deprecated.  Get started with our [quickstart](/components/quickstart/nodejs/actions/) for new actions or learn how to [migrate](/components/migrating/) legacy actions.

Actions are reusable [code](/workflows/steps/code/) steps that integrate your apps, data and APIs. For example, you can send HTTP requests to an external service using the [HTTP action](/destinations/http/), or use actions to send data to Slack, [Amazon S3](/destinations/s3/), and more. You can use thousands of actions across 100+ apps today. 

Typically, integrating with these services requires a lot of code to manage connection logic, error handling, etc. Actions handle that for you. You only need to specify the parameters required for the Action â€” for example, for the [HTTP action](/destinations/http/), what data you want to send and the URL you want to send it to.

**You can also create your own actions that can be shared across your own workflows, or published to all Pipedream users**.

## Using Existing Actions

- Actions are executed in the order they appear in your workflow.

- You can reference the [`event`](/workflows/events/), [`steps`](/workflows/steps/#step-exports), and [`process.env`](/environment-variables/#referencing-environment-variables-in-code) variables when passing [params](/workflows/steps/#passing-data-to-steps-step-parameters) to an action.

- Action return values and [exports](/workflows/steps/#step-exports) may be referenced in later steps via the `steps` object.

- You can add multiple Actions within a single workflow (for example to send data to multiple S3 buckets _and_ an HTTP endpoint). Actions can be added at any point in your workflow.

Let's use the [Send HTTP Request](/destinations/http/) action to send an HTTP request from a workflow. First, **add a new Action to your workflow by clicking on the + button between any two steps**.

Choose the **Send HTTP Request** action:

<div>
<img alt="Send HTTP request action" width="600" src="./images/send-http-request.png">
</div>

This action has one required parameter: the **URL** where you want to send the HTTP request.

This action defaults to sending an HTTP `POST` request. If you'd like to change the HTTP method, add an HTTP payload, query string parameters or headers, you can click the **add individual property** field above the form fields and select the appropriate parameter:

<div>
<img alt="Adding optional params" width="600" src="./images/http-example.png">
</div>

## Creating your own actions

You can author and publish your own actions at [https://pipedream.com/actions](https://pipedream.com/actions), accessible from the **Actions** link in the header.

This video describes how to create an action end-to-end, including how to pass [params](/workflows/steps/#passing-data-to-steps-step-parameters) to that action, how to associate actions with apps, and more:

For example, let's say I wanted to publish my own **Send a Slack Message** action, using Slack's `@slack/web-api` npm package instead of the HTTP API.

I'd go to the **Action** header, click **New**, and start writing code:

<div>
<img alt="Send a Slack message" src="./images/send-slack-message.png">
</div>

Actions have a title, a default [step name](/workflows/steps/#step-names), a description, and code.

Actions are just code steps: you can write any Node.js code, [connect apps](https://docs.pipedream.com/connected-accounts/#connecting-accounts), [define params](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps/#passing-data-to-steps-step-parameters), and more. **Unlike normal code steps, actions can be used across workflows and shared with other users**. This reusability is powerful, and others benefit in huge ways from the actions you share.

### Converting existing code steps to actions

Often you'll have an existing code step that you want to convert to an action to reuse in other workflows. **There are a few restrictions Pipedream imposes on actions to promote reusability**.

#### Replace references to `event` and `steps` with `params`

When you convert a step to an action, you lose access to the variables `event` and `steps` within your code. Actions must receive all input from [`params`](/workflows/steps/params/) or [`auths`](/workflows/steps/code/auth/).

Since actions can be used in any workflow, access to specific `event` data isn't guaranteed: for example, the shape of the `event` variable for the Cron and HTTP trigger is different. And since an action can be placed anywhere in a workflow, you can't ensure the action will have access to specific steps in the `steps` variable. Any user can rename a step, which would also break references to the `steps` variable in the action.

For example, if you've written a code step that references the variable `event.body.name`:

<div>
<img alt="Normal code step with reference to event" width="400px" src="./images/normal-code-step.png">
</div>

you'll need to reference `params.name` when you convert your step to an action, instead. This will expose a [param](/workflows/steps/params/) where the user can enter _their_ specific reference to the variable that contains the name, which would be `event.body.name` or another variable entirely:

<div>
<img alt="action with reference to param" width="400px" src="./images/code-step-converted-to-action.png">
</div>

#### Replace references to `$checkpoint` with `this.$checkpoint`

Code steps normally have access to [workflow state](/workflows/steps/code/state/#workflow-level-state-checkpoint) using the variable `$checkpoint`. But since actions run in different workflows, you don't know whether a user is referencing their own data in `$checkpoint`. References like this could delete a user's existing `$checkpoint` data:

```javascript
$checkpoint = {
  newData: "newValue",
};
```

Instead, replace `$checkpoint` references with [`this.$checkpoint`](/workflows/steps/code/state/#step-level-state-this-checkpoint). `this.$checkpoint` sets state **within a step**, so it's safe to use in actions.

### Save vs. Publish

**Saving** an action makes the action available within any workflow in your account. Saving _does not_ make the action available to anyone else.

When you press the **Publish** button, this makes the action available to everyone.

### How actions are associated with apps

If you've linked one or more apps (click the **+** sign to the left of the code), the action will be associated with that app, so when you search for the action when adding a new step, it'll show up under Github, Slack, etc.

Otherwise, if you haven't linked an app to the action, it'll show up under the **Non-app actions**:

### Versioning

Actions are versioned: each time you publish a change, it increments the minor version number (actions have semantic versions of the form `[major].[minor]`).

For example, publishing an action for the first time cuts a `0.1` version of that action. All users will have access to version `0.1` of your action.

If you want to make a change, you can edit and save your action, and those changes will be available only to your account. Once you're ready to ship the new version, click **Publish** again. Now,

- Any workflows that are using version `0.1` of the action will continue using that version.
- Any time a user searches for your action in a _new_ step, they'll see the most recent version of the action (`0.2`).

You can change the version in any manner you'd like before publishing that new version. For example, you can increment the major version of the action if you're introducing a breaking change.

### Limitations

Action code cannot reference environment variables (for example, using `process.env`). Since actions can be used by anyone, it's not guaranteed that a user would have a specific variable set in their environment. Therefore, actions that use environment variables are unlikely to work for someone else.

Instead, write your action to accept inputs via [step params](/workflows/steps/#passing-data-to-steps-step-parameters).
