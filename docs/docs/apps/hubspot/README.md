# HubSpot

The Pipedream HubSpot app enables you to build event-driven workflows that interact with the HubSpot API. We currently have a variety of pre-built triggers that don't require any code to configure, and pre-built actions are coming soon.

## Connecting HubSpot to Pipedream

You can install the Pipedream HubSpot app in the [Accounts](https://pipedream.com/accounts) section of your account, or directly in a workflow.

### Accounts

1. Visit [https://pipedream.com/accounts](https://pipedream.com/accounts).
2. Click on the **Connect An App** button in the top-right.
3. Search for "HubSpot" among the list of apps, and select it.
4. You will be prompted to sign in to HubSpot and select the account you'd like to connect.
5. Finally, HubSpot will ask to give Pipedream access to your account. Click "Connect app" to proceed.
6. That's it! You can now use this HubSpot account to trigger a workflow, or [link it to any code step](/connected-accounts/#connecting-accounts).

### Within a workflow

1. [Create a new workflow](https://pipedream.com/new).
2. Search for "HubSpot" in the text field when selecting a trigger.
3. Select the one of the triggers that appear, based on your use case.
4. Click the **Connect Account** button near the top of the trigger. This will prompt you to select any existing HubSpot accounts you've previously authenticated with Pipedream, or you can select a **New** account. Clicking **New** opens a new window asking you to allow Pipedream access to your HubSpot account.
5. That's it! You can now connect to the HubSpot API using any of the HubSpot triggers within a Pipedream workflow.
