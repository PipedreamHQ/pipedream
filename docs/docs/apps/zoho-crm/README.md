## Connecting to the Zoho CRM API from Pipedream

1. First, sign up for Pipedream at [https://pipedream.com](https://pipedream.com).
2. [Create a new workflow](https://pipedream.com/new).
3. Select a [trigger](/workflows/steps/triggers/) for your workflow (for example, HTTP or Cron).
4. [Add a new step](/workflows/steps/) and search for "Zoho CRM". This will display [actions](/components#actions) associated with the Zoho CRM app. You can choose to either "Run Node.js code with Zoho CRM" or select one of the prebuilt actions for performing common API operations.
5. Once you've added a step, press the **Connect Zoho CRM** button near the top. If this is your first time authorizing Pipedream's access to your Zoho CRM account, you'll be prompted to accept that access, and Pipedream will store the authorization grant to enable the workflow to access the API. If you've already linked a Zoho CRM account via Pipedream, pressing **Connect Zoho CRM** will list any existing accounts you've linked. 

Once you've connected your account, you can run your workflow and fetch data from the API. You can change any of the code associated with this step, changing the API endpoint you'd like to retrieve data from, or modifying the results in any way.
