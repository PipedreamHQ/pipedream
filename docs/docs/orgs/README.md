# Managing your Organization

Organizations ("orgs") provide your team a way to manage resources in a shared workspace. Any resources created by the org are owned by the org and accessible to its members.

## Creating an org

Click the [context switcher](#switching-context) in the top-left of the page and select the button labeled **New Organization**:

<div>
<img alt="Create a new org" src="./images/create-an-org.gif" width="400px">
</div>

You'll be asked to enter the org's name, which functions as its [username](/user-settings/#account), and an email address. This email address will receive system notifications (like error and usage emails). We recommend using a group email address so everyone can monitor team resources.

## Inviting users to an org

Once you've [created an org](#creating-an-org), visit [https://pipedream.com/settings/users](https://pipedream.com/settings/users) to invite new members to it. 

## Removing members from an org

Visit [https://pipedream.com/settings/users](https://pipedream.com/settings/users) and click the **...** to the right of any user. Choose the option to **Remove User**.

## Switching context

At the top-left of the Pipedream app, you'll see a drop-down menu titled with your username. When you click that, you'll see a list of any orgs you're a member of:

<div>
<img alt="Context switcher" src="./images/context-switcher.png" width="300px">
</div>

This is called the **context switcher**, and sets the context for creating resources in the Pipedream app.

By default, you operate within your **user context**. All resources (workflows, event sources, connected accounts, etc.) you create within this context are owned by your core Pipedream user: the username you created when you signed up for Pipedream.

When you [create an org](#creating-an-org), you'll see that org listed in the context switcher. When you select that org from the context switcher, you'll switch your context to that org. You'll see resources owned by the org here. Any resources you create in this context are owned by the org, not your personal user.

## Migrating workflows from your user to your org

Migrate your account's resources, including workflows, sources and connected accounts to your organization by opening your [Account settings](https://pipedream.com/settings/account).

Under the **User Account Settings** area, open the **Transfer Ownership** dropdown and click the **Transfer your Account** button.

You'll be prompted to choose the organization you'd like to transfer your account's resources to.

_All_ of your accounts resources, including workflows, sources and connected accounts will be transfered to the organization. It's not possible to migrate a specific workflow, source or connected account.

If you don't see the organization you expect in the transfer menu, confirm that your Pipedream account is a member of the organization with your organization admin.

::: tip
Only members of an organization can transfer their account's workflows to the organization.

## Org admins

Org admins have permission to:

- Remove users from orgs
- Manage the org's billing details

Org admins can assign other users as admins:

1. Visit [https://pipedream.com/settings/users](https://pipedream.com/settings/users)
2. Find the user you want to add as an admin
3. Select the **...** to the right of the user, and select the option to **Add Admin**.

## Finding your organization's ID

1. Visit [pipedream.com](https://pipedream.com) and [switch your context](#switching-context) to your organization.
2. Visit [https://pipedream.com/settings/account](https://pipedream.com/settings/account), and expand the **Programmatic Access** section. You'll see your org ID here.

## Configuring Single-sign on (SS0)

Organizations on the [Enterprise Plan](/pricing/#enterprise-plan) can configure Single-sign on in their account, so that your users can login to Pipedream using your identity provider.

Pipedream supports SSO with GSuite, Okta, and other SAML providers. See the guides below to configure SSO for your identity provider:
