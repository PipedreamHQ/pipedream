# Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics, start building workflows to connect APIs and and check out the rest of the docs to learn about Pipedream's advanced capabilities:


- [Maintain state](/workflows/steps/code/state/) between workflow executions 
- [Manage the execution rate and concurrency](/workflows/events/concurrency-and-throttling/) of workflow executions
- Trigger workflows with [large data files up to 5TB](/workflows/steps/triggers/#sending-large-payloads)
- Use a proxy host to [connect to resources behind a firewall](/workflows/steps/code/nodejs/http-requests/#use-an-http-proxy-to-proxy-requests-through-another-host)
- [Work with the file system in Node.js](/workflows/steps/code/nodejs/working-with-files/#working-with-the-filesystem-in-node-js)
- Develop [custom sources and actions](/components/)
- [Contribute](/components/guidelines/) to the [Pipedream registry](https://github.com/pipedreamhq/pipedream/components/)

Also, be sure to check out the quickstarts for [actions](/components/quickstart/nodejs/actions/) and [sources](/components/quickstart/nodejs/actions/) (develop locally, push to Pipedream via [CLI](/cli/), and maintain your code in your own GitHub repo).

Finally, explore Pipedream's [integrations marketplace](https://pipedream.com/explore) and learn how you can [contribute](https://pipedream.com/contributing) to the community!
