# Introduction

Sign up for a [free Pipedream account (no credit card required)](https://pipedream.com/auth/signup) and complete this quickstart guide to learn the basic patterns for workflow development:

- Trigger workflows on HTTP requests, schedules and app events
- Return a custom response from your workflow on HTTP requests 
- Use connected accounts in actions and code steps
- Pass data between code steps and no code actions
- Use npm packages in Node.js code steps
- Scaffold an API request in Node.js
- End workflow execution early

This guide [starts with simple examples](/quickstart/hello-world/) to cover basic Pipedream concepts and builds up to a [real-world use case](/quickstart/real-world-example/) to post richly-formatted Tweets to Slack. Many examples in this guide build on the same workflow, so we recommend that you complete them in order.
