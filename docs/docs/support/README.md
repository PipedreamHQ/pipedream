We also run a [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/pipedream-users/shared_invite/zt-ernlymsn-UHfPg~Dfp08uGkAd8dpkww) where you can chat with the Pipedream team, share your workflows, or learn from others in the community.

Our dedicated support hours are Monday - Friday, 9am - 5pm UTC-8 (US Pacific Time).
