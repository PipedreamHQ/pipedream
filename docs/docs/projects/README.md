# Projects

A workspace can contain one or more _projects_. Projects are a way to organize your workflows into specific groupings or categories.

### Creating Projects

To create a new project, first [open the Projects section in the dashboard](https://pipedream.com/projects).

Then click **Create project** to start a new project.

Enter in your desired name for the project in the prompt, then click **Create**.

That's it, you now have a dedicated new project created within your workspace. Now you can create workflows within this project, or move workflows into it or create folders for further organization.

::: details How do I limit workspace members from viewing or developing workflows in certain projects?

Members of a given workspace can see all projects in the workspace.

If you need to limit certain project's visibility to only some members, then those members belong in a different workspace.

:::

### Creating folders and workflows in projects

Within a given project, you can create folders for your workflows.

Open your project, and then click the **New** button for a dropdown to create a workflow in your current project.

::: tip

Helpful hotkeys to speed up your development

* `C then F` creates a new folder.
* `C then W` creates a new workflow.

:::


Folders can also contain sub-folders, which allows you to create a filing system to organize your workflows.

### Moving workflows into folders

To move workflows into folders, simply drag and drop the workflow into the folder.

You can move workflows or folders up a level by dragging and dropping the workflow to the folder icon at the top of the list.


### Importing workflows into workspaces

::: tip

This only applies to Pipedream accounts that created workflows before the workspaces feature was released.

:::

To import a workflow from the general **Workflows** area of your dashboard into a project, first open up the specific project you'd like to import the workflow into.

Then at the top right of the project's page, click the **Import** button.

You'll be prompted to select a workflow from your **Workflows** area to import.

### Moving workflows between projects

To move a workflow from one project to another project, first check the workflow and then click **Move** to open a dropdown of projects. Select the project to move this workflow to, and click **Move** once more to complete the move.

::: warning Github Sync limitation

At this time it's not possible to move workflows out of GitHub Synchronized Projects.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can sources and connected accounts be organized into projects as well?

At this time no, but that is on our roadmap. Projects will eventually contain all the resources needed for a complete system of workflows to work together.

### Can projects be synchronized to a Github repository?

Yes, [please read here](/projects/git/) for more information on the Github synchronization feature for projects.
