To create a new project, first [open the Projects section in the dashboard](https://pipedream.com/projects).

Then click **Create project** to start a new project.

Enter in your desired name for the project in the prompt, then click **Create**.

That's it, you now have a dedicated new project created within your workspace. Now you can create workflows within this project, or move workflows into it or create folders for further organization.

Members of a given workspace can see all projects in the workspace. 

If you need to limit certain project's visibility to only some members, then those members belong in a different workspace.
