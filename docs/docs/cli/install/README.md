# Installing the CLI

To install the CLI, run:

```bash
curl https://cli.pipedream.com/install | sh
```

Pipedream publishes a build of the CLI for macOS and Linux (for `386`, `amd64`, `arm`, and `arm64` architectures). If you need to use the CLI on another OS or architecture, [please reach out](/support/).

Run `pd` to see a list of all commands, or `pd help <command>` to display help docs for a specific command.

See the [CLI reference](/cli/reference/) for detailed usage and examples for each command.
