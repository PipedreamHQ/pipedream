# Installing the CLI

[[toc]]

## macOS

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install pipedreamhq/pd-cli/pipedream
```

### From source

Run the following command:

```bash
curl https://cli.pipedream.com/install | sh
```

This will automatically download and install the `pd` CLI to your Mac. You can also [download the macOS build](https://cli.pipedream.com/darwin/amd64/latest/pd.zip), unzip that archive, and place the `pd` binary somewhere in [your `PATH`](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/set-path-linux). 

If this returns a permissions error, you may need to run:

```bash
curl https://cli.pipedream.com/install | sudo sh
```

## Linux

Download the [CLI build](#cli-builds) for your architecture below. Unzip that archive, and place the `pd` binary somewhere in [your `PATH`](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/set-path-linux).

## Windows (native)

[Download the CLI build for Windows](https://cli.pipedream.com/windows/amd64/latest/pd.zip). Unzip that archive, save `pd.exe` in Program Files, and [add its file path to `Path` in your system environment variables](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/). Use `pd.exe` in a terminal that supports ANSI colors, like the [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).

## Windows (WSL)

Download the appropriate [Linux CLI build](#cli-builds) for your architecture. Unzip that archive, and place the `pd` binary somewhere in [your `PATH`](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/set-path-linux).
