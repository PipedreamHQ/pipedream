# Workspaces

When you sign up for a Pipedream account, you'll either create a new workspace or join an existing one if you signed up from an invitation.

You can create and join any number of workspaces. For example, you can create one to work alone and another to collaborate with your team. You can also start working alone, then easily add others into your existing workspace to work together on workflows you've already built out.

Once you've created a new workspace, you can invite your team to create and edit workflows together, and organize them within projects and folders (this feature is rolling out now).
