# Billing Settings

You'll find information on your usage data (for specific [Pipedream limits](/workflows/limits/)) in your [Billing Settings](https://pipedream.com/settings/billing). You can also upgrade to [paid plans](https://pipedream.com/pricing) from this page.

## Subscription

If you've already upgraded, you'll see an option to **Manage Subscription** here, which directs you to your personal Stripe portal. Here, you can change your payment method, review the details of previous invoices, and more.

## Usage

[Credits](/pricing/#credits-and-billing) are Pipedream's billable unit, and users on the [free plan](/pricing/#free-plan) are limited on the number of daily free credits allocated. The **Usage** section displays a chart of the daily credits across a historical range of time to provide insight into your usage patterns.

<Callout type="warning">
Credit usage from [Connect](/connect) is not yet reflected in this section.
</Callout>

Hover over a specific column in the chart to see the number of credits run for that specific day:

Click on a specific column to see credits for that day, broken out by workflow / source:

![Credits broken out by workflow / source](/images/account/usage-by-resource.png)

Users on the free tier will see the last 30 days of usage in this chart. Users on [paid plans](https://pipedream.com/pricing) will see the cumulative usage tied to their current billing period.

## Compute Budget

Control the maximum number of credits permitted on your account with a **Credit Budget**.

This will restrict your workspace-wide usage to the specified number of [credits](/pricing/#credits-and-billing) on a monthly or daily basis. The compute budget does not apply to credits incurred by [dedicated workers](/workflows/building-workflows/settings/#eliminate-cold-starts) or Pipedream Connect.

To enable this feature, click on the toggle and define your maximum number of credits in the period.

<Callout type="info">
Due to how credits are accrued, there may be cases where your credit usage may go slightly over the cap.

In an example scenario, with a cap set at 20 credits and a long-running workflow that uses 10 credits per run, it's possible that two concurrent events trigger the workflow, and the cap won't apply until after the concurrent events are processed.
</Callout>

## Limits

For users on the [Free tier](/pricing/#free-plan), this section displays your usage towards your [credits quota](/workflows/limits/#daily-credits-limit) for the current UTC day.
