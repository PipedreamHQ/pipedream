# Connecting to Databases
Communicating with a database is a fundamental component of creating powerful workflows for any application. Whether you're storing application data, querying user information, or analyzing event logs, most workflows require querying data at some step.

Every Pipedream workflow is deployed to its own virtual machine in AWS. This means your workflow runs in its own execution environment with dedicated RAM and disk space, isolated from other users' workflows.

However, outbound traffic from your workflows uses the same network as other AWS services in the us-east-1 region.

<Callout type="info">
 This means your workflows share the`us-east-1` network in AWS, sending requests from standard AWS IP ranges.
</Callout>

## Securing Database Connections
- The most secure way to connect to a database that restricts access to a specific set of IP addresses is to create a [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](/workflows/vpc).
- When you need to connect to a database that restricts access to a specific set of IP addresses, you have a couple options:

### Create a dedicated static IP for outbound traffic
- The most secure, recommended approach, since it gives you a dedicated egress IP only for workflows within your workspace
- Learn more about VPCs in Pipedream [here](/workflows/vpc)

### Use a shared static IP
- The Pipedream SQL Proxy routes network requests through a static IP block
- When you create a connected account with any of [the apps](#supported-databases) that are currently supported by the SQL Proxy, requests to that database from within your Pipedream workflows will come from the IP block below.

#### Supported Databases
The SQL Proxy currently supports [MySQL](https://pipedream.com/apps/mysql), [PostgreSQL](https://pipedream.com/apps/postgresql), and [Snowflake](https://pipedream.com/apps/snowflake). Please let us know if you'd like to see support for other database types.

#### Static IPs
For database allow-listing, add the following IP block:
```
44.223.89.56/29
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between the SQL Proxy and a VPC?
Both the SQL Proxy and a VPC provide secure database connections. A VPC offers enhanced isolation and security by providing a single dedicated static IP for workflows within your workspace, and the SQL proxy routes your database connections through a dedicated set of static IP addresses.
