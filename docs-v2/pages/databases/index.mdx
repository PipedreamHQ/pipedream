# Connecting to Databases
Connecting to a database is essential for developing production workflows. Whether you're storing application data, querying user information, or analyzing event logs, most workflows and serverless functions require querying data at some step.

When your workflow runs, it sends outbound traffic (requests to other APIs, databases and services) through the same network as other AWS services in the `us-east-1` region.

<Callout type="info">
Pipedream workflows run in the AWS `us-east-1` network, sending requests from standard AWS IP ranges
</Callout>

## Connecting to Restricted Databases
**Unless your database is publicly accessible, you'll need to add specific IPs to your database's allow-list.** To do this, you can configure your database connection to run through a shared or dedicated static IP address from Pipedream.

### Create a Dedicated Static IP for Outbound Traffic
- This is the most secure, recommended approach, and gives you a dedicated egress IP that is unique to your workspace
- When deployed to a VPC in Pipedream, all outbound traffic from your workflow runs through the VPC's static IP
- [Learn more here](/workflows/vpc)

### Send Requests from a Shared Static IP
- When enabled on your connected account, Pipedream will route network requests through a static IP block
- When you create a connected account with any of [the apps](#supported-databases) that are currently supported by the SQL Proxy, requests to that database from within your Pipedream workflows will come from the IP block below.

#### Supported Databases
Pipedream's SQL Proxy, which enables the shared static IP, currently supports [MySQL](https://pipedream.com/apps/mysql) and [PostgreSQL](https://pipedream.com/apps/postgresql), and [Snowflake](https://pipedream.com/apps/snowflake) is coming soon. Please let us know if you'd like to see support for other database types.

#### Static Shared IPs
Add the following IP block to your database allow-list:
```
44.223.89.56/29
```


## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between using a shared static IP with the SQL Proxy vs a dedicated IP using a VPC?
Both the SQL Proxy and VPCs enable secure database connections from a static IP.
- VPCs offer enhanced isolation and security by providing a **dedicated** static IP for workflows within your workspace
- The SQL proxy routes requests to your database connections through a set of **shared** static IPs
