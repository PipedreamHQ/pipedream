# Working with SQL

Pipedream makes it easy to interact with SQL databases within your workflows. You can securely connect to your database and use either pre-built no-code triggers and actions to interact with your database, or execute custom SQL queries.

## Schema Explorer
When querying a database, you need to understand the schema of the tables you're working with. The schema explorer provides a visual interface to explore the tables in your database, view their columns, and understand the relationships between them. 

- Once you connect your account with one of the [supported database apps](/databases#supported-databases), we automatically fetch and display the details of your database's schema below
[insert schema explorer here]
- You can view the columns of a table, their data types, and relationships between tables

## SQL Editor
With the built-in SQL editor, you access linting and auto-complete features typical of modern SQL editors.

## Prepared Statements
Prepared statements let you safely execute the same SQL query multiple times with dynamic inputs (parameters).
= Prepared statements use dynamic inputs to safely execute repeated SQL queries, thus helping prevent SQL injection attacks
