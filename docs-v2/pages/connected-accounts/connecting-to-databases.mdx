# Connecting to Databases
Connecting to a database is essential for developing production workflows. Whether you're storing application data, querying user information, or analyzing event logs, most workflows and serverless functions require querying data at some point.

<Callout type="info">
Pipedream workflows run in the AWS `us-east-1` network, sending requests from standard AWS IP ranges.
</Callout>

## Connecting to Restricted Databases
**Unless your database is publicly accessible, you'll likely need to add specific IPs to its allow-list.** To do this, you can configure your database connection to use either a shared or dedicated static IP address from Pipedream:

### Create a Dedicated Static IP for Outbound Traffic
- [Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)](/workflows/vpc) in Pipedream let you deploy any workflow to a private network and is the most secure and recommended approach to using a static IP.
- Once configured, the VPC will give you a dedicated egress IP that's unique to your workspace, and is available to any workflow within your workspace.

### Send Requests from a Shared Static IP
- When configuring your database connection as a [connected account](/connected-accounts) to Pipedream, you can choose to route network requests through a static IP block for [any app that's supported by Pipedream's SQL Proxy](#supported-databases)
- Pipedream's SQL Proxy routes requests to your database from the IP block below.

#### Supported Databases
Pipedream's SQL Proxy, which enables the shared static IP, currently supports [MySQL](https://pipedream.com/apps/mysql), [PostgreSQL](https://pipedream.com/apps/postgresql), and [Snowflake](https://pipedream.com/apps/snowflake). Please let us know if you'd like to see support for other database types.

#### Enabling the Shared Static IP
Connect your account for one of the [supported database apps](#supported-databases) and set **Use Shared Static IP** to **TRUE**, then click **Test connection** to ensure Pipedream can successfully connect to your database.

#### Shared Static IP Block
Add the following IP block to your database allow-list:
```
44.223.89.56/29
```


## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between using a shared static IP with the SQL Proxy vs a dedicated IP using a VPC?
Both the SQL Proxy and VPCs enable secure database connections from a static IP.
- VPCs offer enhanced isolation and security by providing a **dedicated** static IP for workflows within your workspace
- The SQL proxy routes requests to your database connections through a set of **shared** static IPs
