# OAuth Clients
By default, most OAuth apps on Pipedream use Pipedream's official OAuth client. That means when you connect an account, you'll see Pipedream's logo and name in the OAuth authorization screen, along with a set of requested permissions (scopes).
- Pipedream apps solve for a broad range of use cases, which means the scopes requested by Pipedream's official OAuth client may be more than what you need
- To define the exact scope of access you'd like to grant, you can configure a custom OAuth client for most OAuth apps in Pipedream

## Configuring Custom OAuth Clients

<Steps>
### Navigate to the OAuth Clients Page
Open the [OAuth Clients page in your Pipedream account](https://pipedream.com/@/accounts/oauth-clients) and click "New OAuth Client".

### Select the app
Find the app you need. If you can't find what you're looking for, feel free to [submit an integration request](https://pipedream.com/support).

### Enter the required fields
- **Name:** Give the OAuth client a name so it's easy to identify
- **Description:** Optionally add a brief description for additional context
- **Client ID and Secret**: Paste these values from the app's settings that you're configuring (the client secret is sensitive â€“ we'll encrypt and hide it from the UI)
- **Redirect URI:** Copy this Redirect URI and paste it into the app's settings
- **Scopes:** We'll list the scopes from the official Pipedream OAuth client by default. Add or remove scopes as needed, based on your use case.

Click "Save".

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure to include all the scopes you need based on your use case. You can modify the scopes later (you'll need to reconnect your account for changes to take effect). Refer to the app's API documentation for information on what scopes you'll need.
</Callout>

### Connect your account
- Once you've created the OAuth client, you can select "Connect account" from the menu on the right.
- Now you're ready to use the connected account in any workflow, just like any other account in Pipedream.
