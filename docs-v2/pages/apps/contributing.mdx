# Pipedream Registry

When developing workflows with pre-built actions and triggers, under the hood you're using [components](/components/) from the [Pipedream Registry Github Repository](https://github.com/pipedreamhq/pipedream).

Components contributed to the [Pipedream Registry Github Repository](https://github.com/pipedreamhq/pipedream) are published to the [Pipedream marketplace](https://pipedream.com/apps) and are listed in
the Pipedream UI when building workflows.

What is a component?

If you haven't yet, we recommend starting with our Component Development Quickstart Guides for [sources](/components/quickstart/nodejs/sources/)
and [actions](/components/quickstart/nodejs/actions/) to learn how to build components and privately publish them to your account.

## Registry Components Structure

All Pipedream registry components live in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream) under the [`components`](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/components) directory.

Every integrated app on Pipedream has a corresponding directory that defines the actions and sources available for that app. Below is a simplified version of the [Airtable app directory](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/components/airtable) within the registry:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="airtable" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="README.md" />
    <FileTree.File name="airtable.app.mjs" />
    <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="actions" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="get-record" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="get-record.mjs" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="node_modules" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="...here be dragons" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="sources" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="new-records" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="new-records.mjs" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

In the example above, the `components/airtable/actions/get-record/get-record.mjs` component is published as the **Get Record** action under the **Airtable** app within the workflow builder in Pipedream.

The repository is missing the app directory I'd like to add components for

You can request to have new apps integrated into Pipedream.

Once the Pipedream team integrates the app, we'll create a directory for the app in the [`components`](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/components) directory of the GitHub repo.

## Contribution Process

Anyone from the community can build [sources](/sources/) and [actions](/components#actions) for integrated apps.

To submit new components or update existing components:

1. Fork the public [Pipedream Registry Github Repository](https://github.com/pipedreamhq/pipedream).
2. Create a new component within the corresponding app's directory within the `components` directory (if applicable).
3. [Create a PR for the Pipedream team to review](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/compare).
4. Address any feedback provided by Pipedream based on the best practice [Component Guidelines & Patterns](/components/guidelines/).
5. Once the review is complete and approved, Pipedream will merge the PR to the `master` branch
6. The component will be available for use within workflows for all Pipedream developers! 🎉
