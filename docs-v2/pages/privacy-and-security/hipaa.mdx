## Signing a Business Associate Addendum

Pipedream is considered a Business Associate under HIPAA regulations. If you are a Covered Entity or Business Associate under HIPAA, you must have a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) in place with Pipedream before passing PHI to Pipedream. This agreement is an addendum to our standard terms, and outlines your obligations as a customer and Pipedream's obligations as a Business Associate under HIPAA.

Please request a BAA by visiting [https://pipedream.com/support](https://pipedream.com/support).

## Requesting information on HIPAA controls
