### GDPR

#### Data Protection Addendum

Pipedream is considered both a Controller and a Processor as defined by the GDPR. As a Processor, Pipedream implements policies and practices that secure the personal data you send to the platform, and includes a [Data Protection Addendum](https://pipedream.com/dpa) as part of our standard [Terms of Service](https://pipedream.com/terms).

The Pipedream Data Protection Addendum includes the [Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en). These clarify how Pipedream handles your data, and they update our GDPR policies to cover the latest standards set by the European Commission.

You can find a list of Pipedream subprocessors [here](/subprocessors/).

#### Submitting a GDPR deletion request

When you [delete your account](/account/user-settings/#delete-account), Pipedream deletes all personal data we hold on you in our system and our vendors.

If you need to delete data on behalf of one of your users, you can delete the event data yourself in your workflow or event source (for example, by deleting the events, or by removing the data from data stores). Your customer event data is automatically deleted from Pipedream subprocessors.

### HIPAA

Pipedream can sign Business Associate Addendum (BAAs) for customers intending to pass PHI to Pipedream. We can also provide a third-party SOC 2 report detailing our HIPAA-related controls. See our [dedicated HIPAA docs](/privacy-and-security/hipaa) for more details.

## Hosting Details

Pipedream is hosted on the [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS) platform in the `us-east-1` region. The physical hardware powering Pipedream, and the data stored by our platform, is hosted in data centers controlled and secured by AWS. You can read more about AWS’s security practices and compliance certifications [here](https://aws.amazon.com/security/).

Pipedream further secures access to AWS resources through a series of controls, including but not limited to: using multi-factor authentication to access AWS, hosting services within a private network inaccessible to the public internet, and more.

## Intrustion Detection and Prevention

Pipedream uses AWS WAF, GuardDuty, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, Datadog, and other custom alerts to monitor and block suspected attacks against Pipedream infrastructure, including DDoS attacks.

Pipedream reacts to potential threats quickly based on [our incident response policy](#incident-response).

## User Accounts, Authentication and Authorization

When you sign up for a Pipedream account, you can choose to link your Pipedream login to either an existing [Google](https://google.com) or [Github](https://github.com) account, or create an account directly with Pipedream. Pipedream also supports [single-sign on](/workflows/workspaces/#configuring-single-sign-on-sso).

When you link your Pipedream login to an existing identity provider, Pipedream does not store any passwords tied to your user account — that information is secured with the identity provider. We recommend you configure two-factor authentication in the provider to further protect access to your Pipedream account.

When you create an account on Pipedream directly, with a username and password, Pipedream implements account security best practices (for example: Pipedream hashes your password, and the hashed password is encrypted in our database, which resides in a private network accessible only to select Pipedream employees).

## Third party OAuth grants, API keys, and environment variables

When you link an account from a third party application, you may be asked to either authorize a Pipedream OAuth application access to your account, or provide an API key or other credentials. This section describes how we handle these grants and keys.

When a third party application supports an [OAuth integration](https://oauth.net/2/), Pipedream prefers that interface. The OAuth protocol allows Pipedream to request scoped access to specific resources in your third party account without you having to provide long-term credentials directly. Pipedream must request short-term access tokens at regular intervals, and most applications provide a way to revoke Pipedream's access to your account at any time.

Some third party applications do not provide an OAuth interface. To access these services, you must provide the required authorization mechanism (often an API key). As a best practice, if your application provides such functionality, Pipedream recommends you limit that API key's access to only the resources you need access to within Pipedream.

Pipedream encrypts all OAuth grants, key-based credentials, and environment variables at rest in our production database. That database resides in a private network. Backups of that database are encrypted. The key used to encrypt this database is managed by [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) and controlled by Pipedream. KMS keys are 256 bit in length and use the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM). Access to administer these keys is limited to specific members of our team. Keys are automatically rotated once a year. KMS has achieved SOC 1, 2, 3, and ISO 9001, 27001, 27017, 27018 compliance. Copies of these certifications are available from Amazon on request.

When you link credentials to a specific source or workflow, the credentials are loaded into that program's [execution environment](#execution-environment), which runs in its own virtual machine, with access to RAM and disk isolated from other users' code.

No credentials are logged in your source or workflow by default. If you log their values or [export data from a step](/workflows/#step-exports), you can always delete the data for that execution from your source or workflow. These logs will also be deleted automatically based on the [event retention](/workflows/limits#event-history) for your account.

You can delete your OAuth grants or key-based credentials at any time by visiting [https://pipedream.com/accounts](https://pipedream.com/accounts). Deleting OAuth grants within Pipedream **do not** revoke Pipedream's access to your account. You must revoke that access wherever you manage OAuth grants in your third party application.

## Pipedream REST API security, OAuth clients

The Pipedream API supports two methods of authentication: [OAuth](/rest-api/auth/#oauth) and [User API keys](/rest-api/auth/#user-api-keys). **We recommend using OAuth clients** for a few reasons:

✅ OAuth clients are tied to the workspace, administered by workspace admins <br />
✅ Tokens are short-lived <br />
✅ OAuth clients support scopes, limiting access to specific operations <br />

When testing the API or using the CLI, you can use your user API key. This key is tied to your user account and provides full access to any resources your user has access to, across workspaces.

### OAuth clients

Pipedream supports client credentials OAuth clients, which exchange a client ID and client secret for a short-lived access token. These clients are not tied to individual end users, and are meant to be used server-side. You must store these credentials securely on your server, never allowing them to be exposed in client-side code.

Client secrets are salted and hashed before being saved to the database. The hashed secret is encrypted at rest. Pipedream does not store the client secret in plaintext.

You can revoke a specific client secret at any time by visiting [https://pipedream.com/settings/api](https://pipedream.com/settings/api).

### OAuth tokens

Since Pipedream uses client credentials grants, access tokens must not be shared with end users or stored anywhere outside of your server environment.

Access tokens are issued as JWTs, signed with an ED25519 private key. The public key used to verify these tokens is available at https://api.pipedream.com/.well-known/jwks.json. See [this workflow template](https://pipedream.com/new?h=tch_rBf76M) for example code you can use to validate these tokens.

Access tokens are hashed before being saved in the Pipedream database, and are encrypted at rest.

Access tokens expire after 1 hour. Tokens can be revoked at any time.

## Pipedream Connect

[Pipedream Connect](/connect/) is the easiest way for your users to connect to [over {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs](https://pipedream.com/apps), **right in your product**.

### Client-side SDK

Pipedream provides a [client-side SDK](/connect/api/#typescript-sdk-browser) to initiate authorization or accept API keys on behalf of your users in environments that can run JavaScript. You can see the code for that SDK [here](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/packages/sdk).

When you initiate authorization, you must:

1. [Create a server-side token for a specific end user](/connect/api/#create-a-new-token)
2. Initiate auth with that token, connecting an account for a specific user

These tokens can only initiate the auth connection flow. They have no permissions to access credentials or perform other operations against the REST API. They are meant to be scoped to a specific user, for use in clients that need to initiate auth flows.

Tokens expire after 4 hours, at which point you must create a new token for that specific user.

### Connect Link

You can also use [Connect Link](/connect/connect-link/) to generate a URL that initiates the authorization flow for a specific user. This is useful when you want to initiate the auth flow from a client-side environment that can't run JavaScript, or include the link in an email, chat message, etc.

Like tokens, Connect Links are coupled to specific users, and expire after 4 hours.

### REST API

The Pipedream Connect API is a subset of the [Pipedream REST API](/rest-api/). See the [REST API Security](#pipedream-rest-api-security-oauth-clients) section for more information on how we secure the API.

## Execution environment

The **execution environment** refers to the environment in which your sources, workflows, and other Pipedream code is executed.

Each version of a source or workflow is deployed to its own virtual machine in AWS. This means your execution environment has its own RAM and disk, isolated from other users' environments. You can read more about the details of the virtualization and isolation mechanisms used to secure your execution environment [here](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/).

Instances of running VMs are called **workers**. If Pipedream spins up three VMs to handle multiple, concurrent requests for a single workflow, we're running three **workers**. Each worker runs the same Pipedream execution environment. Workers are ephemeral — AWS will shut them down within ~5 minutes of inactivity — but you can configure [dedicated workers](/workflows/building-workflows/settings/#eliminate-cold-starts) to ensure workers are always available to handle incoming requests.

## Controlling egress traffic from Pipedream

By default, outbound traffic shares the same network as other AWS services deployed in the `us-east-1` region. That means network requests from your workflows (e.g. an HTTP request or a connection to a database) originate from the standard range of AWS IP addresses.

[Pipedream VPCs](/workflows/vpc/) enable you to run workflows in dedicated and isolated networks with static outbound egress IP addresses that are unique to your workspace (unlike other platforms that provide static IPs common to all customers on the platform). Outbound network requests from workflows that run in a VPC will originate from these IP addresses, and only workflows in your workspace will run there.

## Encryption of data in transit, TLS (SSL) Certificates

When you use the Pipedream web application at [https://pipedream.com](https://pipedream.com), traffic between your client and Pipedream services is encrypted in transit. When you create an HTTP interface in Pipedream, the Pipedream UI defaults to displaying the HTTPS endpoint, which we recommend you use when sending HTTP traffic to Pipedream so that your data is encrypted in transit.

All Pipedream-managed certificates, including those we create for [custom domains](/workflows/domains/), are created using [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/). This eliminates the need for our employees to manage certificate private keys: these keys are managed and secured by Amazon. Certificate renewal is also handled by Amazon.

## Encryption of data at rest

Pipedream encrypts customer data at rest in our databases and data stores. We use [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) to manage encryption keys, and all keys are controlled by Pipedream. KMS keys are 256 bit in length and use the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM). Access to administer these keys is limited to specific members of our team. Keys are automatically rotated once a year. KMS has achieved SOC 1, 2, 3, and ISO 9001, 27001, 27017, 27018 compliance. Copies of these certifications are available from Amazon on request.

## Email Security

Pipedream delivers emails to users for the purpose of email verification, error notifications, and more. Pipedream implements [SPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework) and [DMARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC) DNS records to guard against email spoofing / forgery. You can review these records by using a DNS lookup tool like `dig`:

```bash
# SPF
dig pipedream.com TXT +short
# DMARC
dig _dmarc.pipedream.com TXT +short
```

## Incident Response

Pipedream implements incident response best practices for identifying, documenting, resolving and communicating incidents. Pipedream publishes incident notifications to a status page at [status.pipedream.com](https://status.pipedream.com/) and to the [@PipedreamStatus Twitter account](https://twitter.com/pipedreamstatus).

Pipedream notifies customers of any data breaches according to our [Data Protection Addendum](https://pipedream.com/dpa).

## Software Development

Pipedream uses GitHub to store and version all production code. Employee access to Pipedream's GitHub organization is protected by multi-factor authentication.

Only authorized employees are able to deploy code to production. Deploys are tested and monitored before and after release.

## Vulnerability Management

Pipedream monitors our code, infrastructure and core application for known vulnerabilities and addresses critical vulnerabilities in a timely manner.

## Corporate Security

### Background Checks

Pipedream performs background checks on all new hires.

### Workstation Security

Pipedream provides hardware to all new hires. These machines run a local agent that sets configuration of the operating system to hardened standards, including:

- Automatic OS updates
- Hard disk encryption
- Anti-malware software
- Screen lock

and more.

### System Access

Employee access to systems is granted on a least-privilege basis. This means that employees only have access to the data they need to perform their job. System access is reviewed quarterly, on any change in role, or upon termination.

### Security Training

Pipedream provides annual security training to all employees. Developers go through a separate, annual training on secure software development practices.

## Data Retention

Pipedream retains data only for as long as necessary to provide the core service. Pipedream stores your workflow code, data in data stores, and other data indefinitely, until you choose to delete it.

Event data and the logs associated with workflow executions are stored according to [the retention rules on your account](/workflows/limits/#event-history).

Pipedream deletes most internal application logs and logs tied to subprocessors within 30 days. We retain a subset of logs for longer periods where required for security investigations.

## Data Deletion

If you choose to delete your Pipedream account, Pipedream deletes all customer data and event data associated with your account. We also make a request to all subprocessors to delete any data those vendors store on our behalf.

Pipedream deletes customer data in backups within 30 days.

## Payment Processor

Pipedream uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) as our payment processor. When you sign up for a paid plan, the details of your payment method are transmitted to and stored by Stripe [according to their security policy](https://stripe.com/docs/security/stripe). Pipedream stores no information about your payment method.
