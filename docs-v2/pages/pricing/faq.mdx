# FAQ

## How does workflow memory affect credits?

Pipedream charges credits proportional to the memory configuration. If you run your workflow at the default memory of {process.env.MEMORY_LIMIT}, you are charged one credit each time your workflow executes for 30 seconds. But if you configure your workflow with `1024MB` of memory, for example, you're charged **four** credits, since you're using `4x` the default memory.

## Are there any limits on paid tiers?

**You can run any number of credits for any amount of compute time** on any paid tier. [Other platform limits](/workflows/limits/) apply.

## When am I billed for paid plans?

When you upgrade to a paid tier, Stripe will immediately charge your payment method on file for the platform fee tied to your plan (see [https://pipedream.com/pricing](https://pipedream.com/pricing))

If you accrue any [additional credits](/pricing/#additional-credits), that usage is reported to Stripe throughout the [billing period](/pricing/#billing-period). That overage, as well as the next platform fee, is charged at the start of the _next_ billing period.

## Do any plans support payment by invoice, instead of credit / debit card?

Yes, Pipedream can issue invoices on the Business Plan. [Please reach out to support](https://pipedream.com/support)

## How does Pipedream secure my credit card data?

Pipedream stores no information on your payment method and uses Stripe as our payment processor. [See our security docs](/privacy-and-security/#payment-processor) for more information.

## Are unused credits rolled over from one period to the next?

**No**. On the Free tier, unused included daily credits under the daily limit are **not** rolled over to the next day.

On paid tiers, unused included credits are also **not** rolled over to the next month.
