# Plans and Pricing

We believe anyone should be able to run simple, low-volume workflows at no cost, and we want you to be able to prototype and get to value before having to pay Pipedream any money. We also hope that you share your [sources](/components/contributing/#sources), [workflows](/workflows/building-workflows/), [actions](/components/contributing/#actions), and other integration components so that other Pipedream users benefit from your work.

To support these goals, Pipedream offers a generous [free plan](#free-plan), free access to Pipedream Connect [while in `development`](/connect/environments), and you can **[request a free trial of our Advanced plan](https://pipedream.com/pricing)**. You can run sources and workflows for free within the limits of the free plan. If you hit these limits, you can upgrade to one of our [paid plans](#paid-plans).

[Read more about our plans and pricing here](https://pipedream.com/pricing).

## Free plan

Workspaces on the Free plan have access to many of the Pipedream features including Workflows and Connect. However, the free plan includes several limitations:

**General:**
- **Daily credit limit**: Free workspaces have a [daily limit of free credits](/workflows/limits/#daily-credits-limit) that cannot be exceeded
- **Support**: Community support only via [our forum](https://pipedream.com/community) and Slack

**Workflows:**
- **Connected accounts**: Limited to 3 different service accounts (like Slack, Google Sheets, GitHub, etc.)
- **Active workflows**: Limited number of active workflows 
- **Polling intervals**: Triggers that poll for updates are limited to a lower frequency compared to paid plans

**Connect:**
- **Development environment**: Access all the features of Connect while in [development mode](/connect/environments)

To lift the daily credit limit and increase the number of workflows and connected accounts, [upgrade to a paid plan](https://pipedream.com/pricing).

## Paid plans

[Visit our pricing page](https://pipedream.com/pricing) to learn more about our paid plans.

All paid plans vary features based on plan level, but each paid plan option will:

- Remove the daily [credits](#credits) limit for both Workflows and Connect usage
- Increase the number of active workflows available
- Increase the number of connected accounts
- Unlock full Connect production features with higher usage limits
- Provide priority support options

## Pipedream Connect

Pipedream Connect provides SDKs and APIs to let you easily add {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ integrations to your app or AI agent. Connect uses the same credit-based pricing model as Workflows, with some key differences in how credits are consumed.

{/* todo: talk about external users */}

### How credits work in Connect

Here's how credit usage works in Connect:

- **`runAction()`** - Consumes 1 credit per call
- **`makeProxyRequest()`** - Consumes 1 credit per call  
- **Deployed triggers** - Consume 1 credit per invocation
  - For polling triggers: 1 credit each time the trigger checks for changes (based on your defined polling schedule/interval)
  - For webhook triggers: 1 credit each time an event is received

<Callout type="info">
We don't charge credits for API calls that help you manage integrations, such as:
- `getAccounts()` - List connected accounts
- `getApps()` - Get available apps
- `getComponents()` - List components
- `configureComponent()` - Configure component settings
- Other management and configuration endpoints
</Callout>

### Connect credit examples

| Scenario | Credits Used |
| --- | --- |
| Running a Slack "Send Message" action via `runAction()` | 1 credit |
| Making an authenticated API request via `makeProxyRequest()` | 1 credit |
| Polling trigger checking for new GitHub issues every 5 minutes | 1 credit per check (12 per hour) |
| Webhook trigger receiving a Stripe payment event | 1 credit per event |
| Calling `getAccounts()` to list user's connected accounts | 0 credits |
| Configuring a component with `configureComponent()` | 0 credits |

### Connect pricing considerations

- Credits are consumed at the workspace level, shared across both Workflows and Connect usage
- The same [free plan](#free-plan) and [paid plans](#paid-plans) limits apply
- Monitor your Connect usage in your [Billing and Usage Settings](https://pipedream.com/settings/billing)

## Pipedream Workflows

Pipedream Workflows uses a credit-based pricing model where you pay for compute time used during workflow execution.

### Credits and billing

Pipedream uses a number of terms to describe platform metrics and details of our plans. See the definitions of key terms below.

#### How credits work for Workflows

Pipedream charges one credit per 30 seconds of compute time at 256MB megabytes of memory (the default) per [workflow segment](/workflows/building-workflows/control-flow/#workflow-segments). Credits are also charged for [dedicated workers](/workflows/building-workflows/settings/#eliminate-cold-starts).

Unlike some other platforms, Pipedream does not charge for usage based on the number of steps. Credits are not charged for workflows during development or testing.

Adding additional memory capacity to workflows will increase credit usage in intervals of 256 megabytes. For example, doubling the memory of a workflow from 256MB to 512MB will double the cost of credits in the same execution time.

##### Scenarios

<Callout type="info">
Developing a workflow with test events in the Pipedream workflow builder is free. No credit usage is incurred.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
If an active workflow isn't executed in a billing period no credit usage is incurred. Pipedream only charges credits for workflow executions.
</Callout>

###### Workflow segments configured to use 256MB memory (default)

| Scenario | Credits Used |
| --- | --- |
| Simple linear workflow - 1 second of compute | 1 credit |
| Simple linear workflow - 15 seconds of compute | 1 credit |
| Simple linear workflow - 35 seconds of compute | 2 credits |
| Linear workflow with a delay- 15 seconds before the delay- 15 seconds after execution resumes | 2 credits |
| Workflow with a branch - 3 seconds before the branch- 15 seconds within the executed branch | 2 credits |
| Workflow with a branch - 3 seconds before the branch, 15 seconds within the executed branch, 3 seconds after the branch in the parent flow | 3 credits |

###### Workflow segments configured to use 1GB memory

| Scenario | Credits Used |
| --- | --- |
| Simple linear workflow - 1 second of compute | 4 credit |
| Simple linear workflow - 15 seconds of compute | 4 credit |
| Simple linear workflow - 35 seconds of compute | 8 credits |
| Linear workflow with a delay- 15 seconds before the delay- 15 seconds after execution resumes | 8 credits |
| Workflow with a branch - 3 seconds before the branch- 15 seconds within the executed branch | 8 credits |
| Workflow with a branch - 3 seconds before the branch, 15 seconds within the executed branch, 3 seconds after the branch in the parent flow | 24 credits |

##### Source credit usage

When an [event source](/workflows/building-workflows/triggers/) triggers a workflow, **the source execution is included for free.** This includes workspaces on the [Free Tier](/pricing/#free-tier).

When a source is configured as a workflow trigger, the core value is in the workflow. You won't be charged for two credits (one to run the source, one to run the workflow) when the workflow contains the core logic.

<Callout type="info">
This free credit per execution **only** applies to sources from the [Pipedream public registry](/workflows/building-workflows/triggers/). If you deploy a private custom source to your account, then all computation time including the inital 30 seconds for that private source counts toward credits.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
A polling source finishing under 30 seconds per execution

For example, a source that polls an API for new events like [Airtable - New Row Added](https://pipedream.com/apps/airtable/triggers/new-records) only takes ~5 seconds to poll and emit events to subscribing workflows.

This would result in **0 credits** per run because the **Airtable - New Row Added** source is a [publicly available component](https://pipedream.com/apps/airtable/triggers/new-records).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
A polling source finishing over 30 seconds per execution

Consider a source (like **RSS - New Item in Feed** for instance) that takes 60 seconds total to finish polling, per execution.

Each execution of this source would result in **0 credits** because the **RSS - New Item in Feed** source is a [publicly available component](https://pipedream.com/apps/rss/triggers/new-item-in-feed).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
A custom source that finished under 30 seconds per execution

This would result in **1 credit** per execution because the initial free credit only applies to Pipedream Public Registry sources attached to at least one workflow.
</Callout>


#### Included credits

When you sign up for a paid plan, you pay a platform fee at the start of each [billing period](#billing-period). This minimum monthly charge grants you a base of included credits that you can use for the rest of your billing period (see your [Billing and Usage Settings](https://pipedream.com/settings/billing) for your exact quota). If you have been granted any additional credit increases by Pipedream, that is added to the included credits.

#### Additional credits

Any credits you run over your [included credit](/workflows/limits/#daily-credits-limit) are called **additional credits**. This usage is added to the invoice for your next [billing period](#billing-period), according to the [invoicing cycle described here](/pricing/faq/#when-am-i-billed-for-paid-plans).

#### Data store keys

A Data Store key represents a single record in a Data Store.

In the example below, there are two records in the Data Store, and therefore there are two keys total.

![Example of a Data Store with two keys](https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1673537163/docs/CleanShot_2023-01-12_at_10.25.25_z6yg8t.png)

## Managing your plan

To cancel, upgrade or downgrade your plan, open the [pricing page](https://pipedream.com/pricing).

To update your billing details, such as your VAT number, email address, etc. use the **Manage Billing Information** button in your [workspace billing settings](https://pipedream.com/settings/billing) to change your plan. Within this portal you can cancel, upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time.

### Billing period

Many of the usage statistics for paid users are tied to a **billing period**. Your billing period starts when you sign up for a paid plan, and recurs roughly once a month for the duration of your subscription.

For example, if you sign up on Jan 1st, your first billing period will last one month, ending around Feb 1st, at which point you'll start a new billing period.

Your invoices are tied to your billing period. [Read more about invoicing / billing here](/pricing/faq/#when-am-i-billed-for-paid-plans).

### Upgrading

Upgrading your subscription instantly activates the features available to your workspace. For example, if you upgrade your workspace from Free to Basic, that workspace will immediately be able to activate more workflows and connected accounts.

### Downgrading

Downgrades will apply at the end of your billing cycle, and any workflows or integrations that use features outside of the new billing plan will be automatically disabled.

For example, if your workspace downgrades from Advanced to Basic and a workflow uses an Advanced feature such as [auto-retries](/workflows/building-workflows/settings/#auto-retry-errors), then this workflow will be disabled because the workspace plan no longer qualifies for that feature.

Additionally, resource limits such as the number of active workflows and connected accounts will also be enforced at this same time.

### Cancelling your plan

To cancel your plan, open the [pricing page](https://pipedream.com/pricing) and click **Cancel** beneath your current plan.

Cancelling your subscription will apply at the end of your current billing period. Workflows, connected accounts and sources will be deactivated from newest to oldest until the Free limits have been reached.
