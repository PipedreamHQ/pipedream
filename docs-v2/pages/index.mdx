# Introduction to Pipedream

Pipedream is the easiest way to automate any process that connects APIs:

- Build and run workflows with code-level control when you need it, and no code when you don't in a [visual builder](/workflows)
- Easily add thousands of customer-facing integrations to your app or AI agent in minutes with [Pipedream Connect](/connect)

The Pipedream platform includes:

- A [serverless runtime](/workflows/building-workflows/code/) and [workflow service](/workflows/building-workflows/)
- SDKs to handle [user authentication](/connect/) for {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs
- Source-available [triggers](/workflows/building-workflows/triggers/) and [actions](/workflows/building-workflows/actions/) for [thousands of integrated apps](https://pipedream.com/explore/)
- One-click [OAuth and key-based authentication](/apps/connected-accounts/) for more than {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS} APIs (use tokens directly in code or with pre-built actions)

## Source-available

Pipedream maintains a [source-available component registry](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream) on GitHub so you can avoid writing boilerplate code for common API integrations. Use components as no code building blocks in workflows, or use them to scaffold code that you can customize. You can also [create a PR to contribute new components](/components/contributing/#contribution-process) via GitHub.
