# Introduction to Pipedream

Pipedream is the fastest way to build and run applications to automate any process. Integrate APIs, AI, databases and more with code-level control when you need it and no code when you don't â€” all with no servers or infrastructure to manage (no devops required).

## Key Capabilities

### Build, Run and Monitor

- Build workflows using the purpose-built IDE
- Test workflows step-by-step to validate changes with real-world data
- Deploy with a click to run your workflow in production
- Inspect workflow executions in real-time, get alerts on errors and debug events
- View and restore any edit/revision or production deployment
- Sync your changes with GitHub repos for source control

### Triggers & Event Queues

- Trigger workflows on HTTP requests, schedules, external app events and more
- Manage the concurrency and execution rate at which event streams invoke workflows

### Event and Step Data
- Pass any JSON-serializable data between steps and reference it directly in code or in pre-built actions by referencing the `steps` object
- Process large files using the large upload flag for HTTP endpoints or using File Stores

### HTTP / Webhook
 
- Generate unique trigger URLs with a click
- Make HTTP requests from any step with an intuitive request builder
- Return custom HTTP responses from HTTP-triggered workflows
- Configure custom domains to trigger workflows on your own domain (e.g. `https://endpoint.yourdomain.com`)

### Apps & APIs

- Connect OAuth and key-based accounts for ${process.env.PUBLIC_APPS} apps
- Use apps in [pre-built triggers and actions](/workflows/actions/) 
- Programmatically access OAuth tokens and API keys securely in code or via our API request builder
- Configure your own OAuth client for any app

### Code

- Run custom custom [Node.js](/code/nodejs/), [Python](/code/python/), [Golang](/code/go/), or [Bash](/code/bash/) 
- Use most npm and pypi packages
- Develop and publish private triggers and actions via CLI

### Databases

- Connect to databases with shared and dedicated static IP options
- Build queries with an intuitive schema explorer and SQL editor

### Orchestration & Fault Tolerance
- Orchestrate execution of non-linear workflows
- Normalize results and continue after a non-linear operation
- Nest control flow operators for advanced use cases
- Return HTTP responses during or after most non-linear operations
- Execute long running workflows (workflow timeout resets at each control flow boundary)
- Enable auto-retry to recover from intermittent errors automatically 

### Autoscaling
- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2

### Built-In Services
- Use data stores to maintain state across workflow executions.
- Run workflows in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPCs) to isolate the network and get a static egress IP unique to your workspace
- Inspect workflow executions and logs in real-time

The platform processes billions of events and is built and [priced](https://pipedream.com/pricing/) for use at scale. [Our team](https://pipedream.com/about) has built internet scale applications and managed data pipelines in excess of 10 million events per second (EPS) at startups and high-growth environments like BrightRoll, Yahoo!, Affirm and Instacart.

Our [community](https://pipedream.com/community) uses Pipedream for a wide variety of use cases including:

- Connecting SaaS apps
- General API orchestration and automation
- Database automations ([learn about connecting to resources behind a firewall](/databases))
- Custom notifications and alerting
- Mobile and JAMstack backends
- Rate limiting, request smoothing
- Event queueing and concurrency management
- Webhook inspection and routing
- Prototyping and demos

## Source-available

Pipedream maintains a [source-available component registry](https://github.com/pipedreamhq/pipedream/) on GitHub so you can avoid writing boilerplate code for common API integrations. Use components as no code building blocks in workflows, or use them to scaffold code that you can customize. You can also [create a PR to contribute new components](/apps/contributing/#contribution-process) via GitHub.
