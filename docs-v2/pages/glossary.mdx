### Bi-directional GitHub sync

When you configure [GitHub Sync](#github-sync), you can make changes in Pipedream and push them to GitHub, or make changes locally, push to GitHub, and deploy to Pipedream. Since changes can be made in each system and communicated to the other, the sync is bi-directional.

### Branch

Short for [Git branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell). When using [Pipedream GitHub Sync](#github-sync), you can sync a GitHub repository to a Pipedream project and manage changes to code in a branch.

### Component API

The programming interface for creating [components](#component) in Pipedream.

### Component guidelines

Guidelines applied to components submitted to [the Pipedream component registry](#component-registry).

### Component registry

The public registry of [components](#component) available to Pipedream users, [available on GitHub](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream).

[A workflow setting](/workflows/concurrency-and-throttling#concurrency) that lets users configure the number of concurrent [workers](#worker) available to process events.

### Connected account

A specific account or credentials used to connect to a Pipedream [integration](#integration). If both you and your team member have an account with OpenAI, for example, you would connect each account as a distinct connected account. [See the docs](/connected-accounts) for more details.

### Connected account access control

You can restrict access to connected accounts to specific individuals or share with the entire workspace. [See the docs](/connected-accounts#access-control) for more details.

### Credit

Pipedream charges one credit per 30 seconds of compute time at 256MB megabytes of memory (the default) per workflow execution. Credits are also charged for [dedicated workers](#dedicated-workers). [See the docs](/pricing#credits) for more details.

### Custom domain

By default, [HTTP endpoints](#http-endpoint) are served from the `*.m.pipedream.net` domain. You can configure a [custom domain](/workflows/domains) if you want to host that endpoint on your own domain.

### Deduper

[Event sources](#event-source) can receive duplicate requests tied to the same event. Pipedream's infrastructure supports [deduplication](/components/api#dedupe-strategies) to ensure that only unique events are emitted by a source.

### Delay

[A built-in service](/workflows/flow-control#delay) that lets you pause a workflow for a specified amount of time. You can delay workflows using pre-built actions, or delay in code.

### Destination

### Event

Events are emitted by [sources](#event-sources) and consumed by workflows. Events can be triggered by a variety of sources, including HTTP requests, cron schedules, and third-party APIs. Events can be passed to actions, which can process the event data and perform a variety of operations, including making HTTP requests, sending emails, and interacting with third-party APIs.

### Event context

### Event history

A log of all workflow events and executions, available in the [event inspector](#inspector) or the global [event history UI](/event-history).

### Event queue

When using built-in [concurrency](#concurrency) or [throttling](#throttling) controls, events are queued in a workflow-specific queue and processed by available [workers](#worker).

### Event source

[Components](#component) that watch for events from a third-party data source, emitting those events to [listeners](#listener).

### Execution

When a workflow is triggered by an event, the running instance of the workflow on that event is called an execution.

### Execution environment

[The virtual machine](/privacy-and-security#execution-environment) and internal Pipedream platform code that runs a workflow execution. An instance of an execution environment is called a [worker](#worker).

### Execution rate controls

The workflow setting that allows users to configure the number of executions a workflow can process per unit time. Also known as throttling. [See the docs](/workflows/concurrency-and-throttling#throttling) for more details.

### Export

Depending on the context, **export** can function as a noun or verb:

- **Noun**: A synonym for [step export](#step-export)
- **Verb**: The act of exporting data from a step using Pipedream primitives like [`$.export`](/code/nodejs#using-export) or `return`.

### Expression
