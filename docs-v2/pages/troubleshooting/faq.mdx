## How do I resolve the error "Undeployed changes — You have made changes to this workflow. Deploy the latest version from the editor"

On workflows that are not [synced with GitHub](/workflows/git/), you may notice the following warning at the top of your workflow:

> **Undeployed changes** — You have made changes to this workflow. Deploy the latest version from the editor

This means that you've made some changes to your workflow that you haven't yet deployed. To see a diff of what's changed, we recommend [enabling GitHub sync](/workflows/git/), where you'll get a full commit history of changes made to your workflows, synced to your own GitHub repo.

## Is there a way to replay workflow events programmatically?

Not today. Please upvote and add your feedback to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/issues/2784).

## How do I store and retrieve data across workflow executions?

If you operate your own database or data store, you can connect to it directly in Pipedream.

Pipedream also operates a [built-in key-value store](/workflows/data-management/data-stores/) that you can use to get and set data across workflow executions and different workflows.

## How do I delay the execution of a workflow?

Use Pipedream's [built-in Delay actions](/workflows/building-workflows/control-flow/delay/) to delay a workflow at any step.

## How can my workflow run faster?

Here are a few things that can help your workflow execute faster:

1. **Increase memory:** Increase your [workflow memory](/workflows/building-workflows/settings/#memory) to at least 512 MB. Raising the memory limit will proportionally increase CPU resources, leading to improved performance and reduced latency.

2. **Return static HTTP responses:** If your workflow is triggered by an HTTP source, return a [static HTTP response](/workflows/building-workflows/triggers/#http-responses) directly from the trigger configuration. This ensures the HTTP response is sent to the caller immediately, before the rest of the workflow steps are executed.

3. **Simplify your workflow:** Reduce the number of [steps](/workflows/#code-actions) and [segments](/workflows/building-workflows/control-flow/#workflow-segments) in your workflow, combining multiple steps into one, if possible. This lowers the overhead involved in managing step execution and exports.

4. **Activate warm workers:** Use [warm workers](/workflows/building-workflows/settings/#eliminate-cold-starts) to reduce the startup time of workflows. Set [as many warm workers](/workflows/building-workflows/settings/#how-many-workers-should-i-configure) as you want for high-volume traffic.

## How can I save common functions as steps?

You can create your own custom triggers and actions ("components") on Pipedream using [the Component API](/workflows/contributing/components/api/). These components are private to your account and can be used in any workflow.

You can also publish common functions in your own package on a public registry like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

## Is Puppeteer supported in Pipedream?

## Is Playwright supported in Pipedream?

Yes, see [our Playwright docs](/workflows/building-workflows/code/nodejs/browser-automation/#playwright) for more detail.
