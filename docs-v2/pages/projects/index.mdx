# Projects

A workspace can contain one or more _projects_. Projects are a way to organize your workflows into specific groupings or categories.

## Getting started with projects

### Creating projects

To create a new project, first [open the Projects section in the dashboard](https://pipedream.com/projects).

Then click **Create project** to start a new project.

Enter in your desired name for the project in the prompt, then click **Create**.

That's it, you now have a dedicated new project created within your workspace. Now you can create workflows within this project, or move workflows into it or create folders for further organization.

### Creating folders and workflows in projects

Within a given project, you can create folders for your workflows.

Open your project, and then click the **New** button for a dropdown to create a workflow in your current project.

- `C then F` creates a new folder.
- `C then W` creates a new workflow.

</Callout>

Folders can also contain sub-folders, which allows you to create a filing system to organize your workflows.

### Moving workflows into folders

To move workflows into folders, simply drag and drop the workflow into the folder.

You can move workflows or folders up a level by dragging and dropping the workflow to the folder icon at the top of the list.

### Importing workflows into projects

<Callout type="info">
  This only applies to Pipedream accounts that created workflows before the
  projects feature was released.
</Callout>

To import a workflow from the general **Workflows** area of your dashboard into a project, first open up the specific project you'd like to import the workflow into.

Then at the top right of the project's page, click the **Import** button.

You'll be prompted to select a workflow from your **Workflows** area to import.

### Moving workflows between projects

To move a workflow from one project to another project, first check the workflow and then click **Move** to open a dropdown of projects. Select the project to move this workflow to, and click **Move** once more to complete the move.

Github Sync limitation

At this time it's not possible to move workflows out of GitHub Synchronized Projects.

</Callout>

## Access Controls

The [projects list view](https://pipedream.com/projects) contains **Owner** and **Access** columns.

**Owner** indicates who within the workspace owns each project. This is typically the person who created the project.

![Project Listing (Owner)](./images/project-listing-owner.png)

<Callout type="warning">
  Projects created before February 2024 don't automatically have owners, which
  has no functional impact.
</Callout>

**Access** indicates which workspace members have access to each project, and this can be displayed as "me", "Workspace", or "N members".

### Permissions

Workspace owners and admins are able to perform all actions in projects, whereas workspace members are restricted from performing certain actions in projects.

### Managing access

<Callout type="info">
  By default, all projects are accessible to all workspace members. Workspaces
  on the [Business plan](https://pipedream.com/pricing) can restrict access for
  individual projects to specific workspace members.
</Callout>

You can easily modify the access rules for a project directly from the [project list view](https://pipedream.com/projects), either by clicking the access badge in the project row (fig 1) or clicking the 3 dots to open the action menu, then selecting **Manage Access** (fig 2).

Via the access badge (fig 1):

![Click the access badge to manage access](./images/access-badge-click.png)

Via the action menu (fig 2):

![Click manage access from the action menu](./images/manage-access-overflow-menu.png)

From here, a slideout drawer reveals the access management configuration:

![Manage access slideout workspace access](./images/slideout-workspace-share.png)

Toggle the **Restrict access to this project** switch to manage access:

![Manage access slideout restricted](./images/slideout-restricted.png)

Select specific members of the workspace to grant access:

![Manage access slideout showing member dropdown](./images/slideout-member-dropdown.png)

You can always see who has access and remove access if necessary:

## Project variables and secrets

Environment variables defined at the global workspace level are accessible to all workspace members and workflows within the workspace. To restrict access to sensitive variables or secrets, define them at the project-level and [configure access controls for the project](/projects/#managing-access).

[See here](/environment-variables) for info on creating, managing, and using environment variables and secrets.

<Callout type="info">
  **Project variables override workspace variables**. When the same variable is
  defined at both the workspace and project levels (for example,
  `process.env.BASE_DOMAIN`), the **project** variable takes precedence.
</Callout>

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can sources and connected accounts be organized into projects as well?

At this time no, but that is on our roadmap. Projects will eventually contain all the resources needed for a complete system of workflows to work together.

### Can projects be synchronized to a Github repository?

Yes, [please read here](/projects/git/) for more information on the Github synchronization feature for projects.

### Can I configure which members in my workspace have access to individual projects?

Yes! Learn about managing access [here](/projects/#managing-access).
