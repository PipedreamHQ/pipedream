# Manage your team

## Inviting others to a join a workspace

After opening your workspace settings, open the [Membership](https://pipedream.com/settings/users) tab.

- Invite people to your workspace by entering their email address and then clicking **Send**
- Or create an invite link to more easily share with a larger group (you can limit access to only specific email domains)

### Managing member permissions

By default, new workspace members are assigned the **Member** level permission.

**Members** will be able to perform general tasks like viewing, developing, and deploying workflows.

However, only **Admins** will be able to manage workspace level settings, like changing member roles, renaming workspaces, and modifying Slack error notifications.

#### Promoting a member to admin

To promote a member to an admin level account in your workspace, click the 3 dots to the right of their email and select "Make Admin".

#### Demoting an admin to a member

To demote an admin back to a member, click the 3 dots to the right of their email address and select "Remove Admin".
