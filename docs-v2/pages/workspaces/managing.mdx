# Managing workspaces

## Creating a new workspace

To create a new workspace,

1. Open the dropdown menu in the top left of the Pipedream dashboard
2. Select **New workspace**
3. You'll be prompted to name the workspace (you can [change the name later](/workspaces/#renaming-a-workspace))

## Workspace settings

Find your current [workspace settings](https://pipedream.com/settings/account) like current members, under the **Settings** navigation menu item on the left hand side. This is where you can manage your workspace settings, including the workspace name, members, and member permissions.

### Finding your workspace's ID

Visit your [workspace settings](https://pipedream.com/settings/account) and scroll down to the **API** section. You'll see your workspace ID here.

### Requiring Two-Factor Authentication
As a workspace admin or owner on the [Business plan](https://pipedream.com/pricing), you're able to **require** that all members in your workspace must enable 2FA on their account.

1. Open the Authentication tab in your [workspace settings](https://pipedream.com/settings/authentication) (you must be an admin or owner to make changes here)
2. Make sure you're in the [correct workspace](/workspaces/#switching-between-workspaces)
3. Click the toggle under **Require 2FA** â€” this will open a confirmation modal with some additional information
4. Once you enable the change in the modal, **all workspace members (including admins and owners) will immediately be required to configure 2FA on their account**. All new and existing workspace members will be required to set up 2FA the next time they sign in.

![Require 2FA Toggle](https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1695147277/require_2fa_xha6yc.png)

<Callout type="warning">
Anyone who is currently logged in to Pipedream will be temporarily signed out until they set up 2FA

If anyone is actively making changes to a workflow, their session may be interrupted. We recommend enabling the 2FA requirement in off hours.
</Callout>


### Configuring Single Sign-On (SSO)

Workspaces on the Business plan can configure Single Sign-On, so your users can login to Pipedream using your identity provider.

Pipedream supports SSO with Google, Okta, and any provider that supports the SAML protocol. See the guides below to configure SSO for your identity provider:

- [Okta](/workspaces/sso/okta/)
- [Google](/workspaces/sso/google/)
- [Other SAML provider](/workspaces/sso/saml/)

### SCIM

Pipedream supports provisioning user accounts from your IdP via SCIM. Any workspace on the Business plan can configure Single Sign-On with SCIM.

### Renaming a workspace

To rename a workspace, open your [workspace settings](https://pipedream.com/settings/account) and navigate to the **General** tab.

Click the save button to save the changes.

<Callout type="info">
This action is only available to workspace **admins**.
</Callout>

### Deleting a workspace

To delete a workspace, open your workspace settings and navigate to the **Danger Zone**.

Click the **Delete workspace** button and confirm the action by entering in your workspace name and `delete my workspace` into the text prompt.

<Callout type="error">
Deleting a workspace will delete all **sources**, **workflows**, and other resources in your workspace.

Deleting a workspace is **irreversible** and permanent.
</Callout>

## Switching between workspaces

To switch between workspaces, open the dropdown menu in the top left of the Pipedream dashboard.

Select which workspace you'd like to start working within, and your Pipedream dashboard context will change to that workspace.
