# Pipedream Connect

<Callout type="info">
Pipedream Connect is currently in **preview**, and we're looking for feedback. Please [let us know](https://pipedream.com/support) how you're using it, what's not working, and what else you'd like to see.

While in the **preview** phase, the API may change without notice. We'll do our best to communicate any changes, but please be aware that **breaking changes may occur.**
</Callout>

## Overview

Connect enables you to easily integrate more than {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs directly into your application, letting you make authenticated requests on behalf of your end users, while not having to worry about authorization grants or refresh tokens, and includes these features:
1. [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/packages/sdk) to initiate authorization for any one of the [{process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs](https://pipedream.com/apps) available on Pipedream
2. [REST API](/connected-accounts/api) to retrieve credentials (access token, API key, etc.) for your end users
3. [Serverless runtime platform](/), [thousands of pre-built source-available triggers and actions](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/components), and a first-class developer experience to build, test, and deploy custom workflows

## Getting started

<Steps>

### Enable the feature flag
Enable the feature flag for **Connect** in your Pipedream account: [https://pipedream.com/settings/alpha](https://pipedream.com/settings/alpha)

### Verify your application's domain


### Configure an OAuth client in Pipedream


### Run the example app


### Open your Pipedream project
Open an existing Pipedream project or create a new one: [https://pipedream.com/projects](https://pipedream.com/projects)


### Retrieve your credentials from Pipedream's API


</Steps>

## Retrieving End User Credentials
After your end users have connected their account using Pipedream Connect, you can retrieve their credentials using Pipedream's REST API, which enables you to make authenticated requests on their behalf

### Base URL

The base URL for all requests is [https://api.pipedream.com/v1](https://api.pipedream.com/v1).

### Authentication

You authenticate to the Connect REST API using Basic Auth. Send your Pipedream [Project Public Key]() as the username and the [Project Secret Key]() as the password. When you make API requests, pass an
`Authorization` header of the following format:

```
Authorization: Basic <Base 64 encoded public_key:secret_key>
```

For example, here's how you can use `cURL` to fetch a list of all accounts in your projet:

```shell
curl 'https://api.pipedream.com/v1/accounts' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <Base 64 encoded public_key:secret_key>'
```

### API Reference

#### List accounts
List all end user connected accounts in the project

```
GET /accounts/
```

##### Example Response — List accounts
