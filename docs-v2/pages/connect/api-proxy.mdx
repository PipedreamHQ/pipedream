# Connect API Proxy

Pipedream Connect provides a proxy API that you can use to send authenticated requests to any integrated API on behalf of your users. This is useful in a few scenarios:

1. You need code-level control and you want to use [Pipedream's OAuth](/connect/managed-auth/oauth-clients/#using-pipedream-oauth) instead of [your own OAuth client](/connect/managed-auth/oauth-clients/#using-a-custom-oauth-client)
2. There isn't a [pre-built tool](/connect/components/) (action) for the app, or you need to modify the request
3. You want to avoid storing end user credentials in your app

## Overview

The Connect proxy enables you to interface with any integrated API and make authenticated requests on behalf of your users, without dealing with OAuth or storing end user credentials.

1. You send a request to the proxy and identify the end user you want to act on behalf of
2. The proxy sends the request to the upstream API and dynamically inserts your end user's auth credentials
3. The proxy returns the response from the upstream API back to you

<Callout type="info">
Before getting started with the Connect proxy, make sure you've already gone through the [managed auth quickstart](/connect/managed-auth/quickstart/) for Pipedream Connect.
</Callout>

## Getting started

You can send requests to the Connect proxy using either the Pipedream SDK with a fetch-style interface or the Pipedream REST API.

### Prerequisites

- A [Pipedream OAuth client](/rest-api/auth/#oauth) to make authenticated requests to Pipedream's API
- Connect [environment](/connect/managed-auth/environments/) (ex, `production` or `development`)
- The [external user ID](/connect/api/#external-users) for your end user (ex, `abc-123`)
- The [account ID](/connect/api/#accounts) for your end user's connected account (ex, `apn_1234567`)

Refer to the full Connect API [here](/connect/api/).

### Authenticating on behalf of your users

One of the core benefits of using the Connect API Proxy is not having to deal with storing or retrieving sensitive credentials for your end users. 

Since Pipedream has {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ integrated apps, we know how the upstream APIs are expecting to receive access tokens or API keys. When you send a request to the proxy, Pipedream will look up the corresponding connected account for the relevant user, and **automatically insert the authorization credentials in the appropriate header or URL param**.

### Sending requests

When making requests to the Connect Proxy, you must provide the following parameters:

#### Request parameters

**URL**

- The URL of the API you want to call (ex, `https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage`)
- When using the REST API, this should be a URL-safe Base64 encoded string (ex, `aHR0cHM6Ly9zbGFjay5jb20vYXBpL2NoYXQucG9zdE1lc3NhZ2U`)

<Callout type="info">
**For apps with dynamic domains** (like Zendesk, Zoho, GitLab), you should use relative paths in your proxy requests. Pipedream automatically resolves the correct domain based on the user's connected account. See [When to use relative vs full URLs](#when-to-use-relative-vs-full-urls) for details.
</Callout>

**HTTP method**

- Use the HTTP method required by the upstream API

**Body**

- Optionally include a body to send to the upstream API

**Headers**

- If using the REST API, include the `Authorization` header with your Pipedream OAuth access token (`Bearer {access_token}`)
- Headers that contain the prefix `x-pd-proxy` will get forwarded to the upstream API

#### Examples

<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
import { createBackendClient } from "@pipedream/sdk/server";

const pd = createBackendClient({
  environment: {development | production},
  projectId: {your_pipedream_project_i_d},
  credentials: {
    clientId: {your_oauth_client_id},
    clientSecret: {your_oauth_client_secret}
  },
});


const resp = await pd.makeProxyRequest(
  {
    searchParams: {
      account_id: "{account_id}", // The account ID for your end user (ex, apn_1234567)
      external_user_id: "{external_user_id}", // The external user ID for your end user
    }
  },
  {
    url: "https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage", // Include any query params you need; no need to Base64 encode the URL if using the SDK
    options: {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        hello: "world!" // Include any headers you need to send to the upstream API
      },
      body: {
        text: "hello, world",
        channel: "C03NA8B4VA9"
      },
    },
  }
)

// Parse and return the data you need
console.log(resp);
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
# First, obtain an OAuth access token to authenticate to the Pipedream API

curl -X POST https://api.pipedream.com/v1/oauth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "client_id": "{your_oauth_client_id}",
    "client_secret": "{your_oauth_client_secret}"
  }'

# The response will include an access_token. Use it in the Authorization header below.

curl -X POST "https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/{your_project_id}/proxy/{url_safe_base64_encoded_url}?external_user_id={external_user_id}&account_id={apn_xxxxxxx}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -H "x-pd-environment: {development | production}" \
  -d '{
    "text": "hello, world",
    "channel": "C03NA8B4VA9"
  }'

# Parse and return the data you need
```

## Allowed domains

The vast majority of apps in Pipedream work with the Connect Proxy. To check if an app is supported and what domains are allowed, use `pd.getApps()` or the [`/apps` REST API](/rest-api/#list-apps).

### Understanding the Connect object

Each app in the `/apps` API response includes a `connect` object:

```json
{
  "id": "app_1Z2hw1",
  "name_slug": "gitlab",
  "name": "GitLab",
  // ...other fields...
  "connect": {
    "proxy_enabled": true,
    "allowed_domains": ["gitlab.com"],
    "base_proxy_target_url": "https://{{custom_fields.base_api_url}}"
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| `proxy_enabled` | Whether the app supports the Connect Proxy |
| `allowed_domains` | Domains you can send requests to when using full URLs |
| `base_proxy_target_url` | The base URL for proxy requests, may contain placeholders for account-specific values |

### When to use relative vs full URLs

The format of `base_proxy_target_url` determines whether you should use a relative path or full URL:

#### Apps with static domains

If `base_proxy_target_url` is a standard URL (e.g., `https://slack.com`), you can use either:
- **Full URL**: `https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage`
- **Relative path**: `/api/chat.postMessage`

#### Apps with dynamic domains

If `base_proxy_target_url` contains placeholders like `{{custom_fields.base_api_url}}`, you **must** use relative paths. This applies to:
- Self-hosted instances (GitLab)
- Apps with account-specific subdomains (Zendesk, Zoho)

For these apps, Pipedream resolves the actual domain from the user's connected account at runtime.

### Examples

<Tabs items={['Slack (static domain)', 'GitLab (dynamic domain)']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
// Both work
await pd.makeProxyRequest({...}, {
  url: "https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage"
})

await pd.makeProxyRequest({...}, {
  url: "/api/chat.postMessage"
})
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
// Must use relative path
await pd.makeProxyRequest({...}, {
  url: "/api/v4/projects"  // Pipedream resolves to the end user's GitLab instance
})
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Discovering app support programmatically

<Tabs items={['SDK', 'REST API']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
const apps = await pd.getApps()

// Filter for apps that support the proxy
const proxyEnabledApps = apps.filter(app => app.connect?.proxy_enabled)
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
curl https://api.pipedream.com/v1/apps \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

Filter the response for apps where `connect.proxy_enabled` is `true`.
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Limits

- The Connect Proxy limits API requests to 1,000 requests per 5 minutes per project. Requests that surpass this limit will receive a `429` response.
- The maximum timeout for a request is 30 seconds. Requests that take longer than 30 seconds will be terminated, and Pipedream will return a `504` error to the caller.

Please [let us know](https://pipedream.com/support) if you need higher limits.
