# Embedding components in your application

Pipedream Connect provides APIs to embed [pre-built components](/components) directly in your application
or AI agent, unlocking access to {process.env.REGISTRY_COMPONENTS}+ pre-built API operations. Enable [your end users](/connect/api#external-users) to
configure, deploy, and invoke Pipedream triggers and actions for more than {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS} APIs.

## What are components?

In Pipedream, [components](/components) are self-contained executable units of code. Your end users configure the inputs and the components produce a
result that's exported as output. These components are developed and maintained by Pipedream
and our community and their source code is available in our [public Github repo](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/components).

<Callout type="info">
Running components for your end users via Pipedream Connect is in **beta**, and we're looking for feedback. Please [let us know](https://pipedream.com/support) how you're using it, what's not working, and what else you'd like to see.
</Callout>

## Getting started

<Callout type="info">
Refer to the [Connect API docs](/connect/api) for the full API reference. Below is a quickstart with a few specific examples.

You can skip steps 1 and 2 if you already know the component you want to use or if you'd prefer to [pass a natural language prompt to Pipedream's component search API](/rest-api#search-for-registry-components).
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Find the app you want to use

In order to find the right trigger or action to configure and run, you first need to find the app. In this example, we'll search for `gitlab`.

```text
GET /v1/connect/apps?q=gitlab
```

Here's the response:

```json
{
  "page_info": {
    "total_count": 1,
    "count": 1,
    "start_cursor": "Z2l0bGFi",
    "end_cursor": "Z2l0bGFi"
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "app_1Z2hw1",
      "name_slug": "gitlab",
      "name": "GitLab",
      "auth_type": "oauth",
      "description": "GitLab is the most comprehensive AI-powered DevSecOps Platform.",
      "img_src": "https://assets.pipedream.net/s.v0/app_1Z2hw1/logo/orig",
      "custom_fields_json": "[{\"name\":\"base_api_url\",\"label\":\"Base API URL\",\"description\":\"The Base API URL defaults to `gitlab.com`. If you are using self-hosted Gitlab, enter your base url here, e.g. `gitlab.example.com`\",\"default\":\"gitlab.com\",\"optional\":null}]",
      "categories": [
        "Developer Tools"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### List the available components for the app

Once you have the app you want to use, now you can list the triggers and/or actions for that app. We'll list the actions for Gitlab and we'll pass the `name_slug` `gitlab` as the `app`.

```text
GET /actions?app=gitlab
```

Here's the response:

```json
{
  "page_info": {
    "total_count": 20,
    "count": 10,
    "start_cursor": "c2NfbHlpRThkQQ",
    "end_cursor": "c2NfQjVpTkJBTA"
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "List Commits",
      "version": "0.0.2",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-list-commits"
    },
    {
      "name": "Update Issue",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-update-issue"
    },
    {
      "name": "Update Epic",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-update-epic"
    },
    {
      "name": "Search Issues",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-search-issues"
    },
    {
      "name": "List Repo Branches",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-list-repo-branches"
    },
    {
      "name": "Get Repo Branch",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-get-repo-branch"
    },
    {
      "name": "Get Issue",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-get-issue"
    },
    {
      "name": "Create issue",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-create-issue"
    },
    {
      "name": "Create Epic",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-create-epic"
    },
    {
      "name": "Create Branch",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-create-branch"
    }
  ]
}
```
### Retrieve the component's definition

To configure and run a component for your end users, you need to understand
the component's definition. Now that you have the component's key from the previous step,
you can retrieve its structure from the Pipedream API. See the [component
structure](/components/api#component-structure) section in our docs for more
details.

As an example, the following API call will return the structure of the **List
Commits** action for Gitlab:

```text
GET /v1/connect/components/gitlab-list-commits
```

The response will contain the component's structure, including its user-friendly name,
version, and most importantly, the configuration options the component accepts
(also known as [props](/components/api#props) or "properties").
Here's an example of the response for the component in the example above:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "List Commits",
    "version": "0.0.3",
    "key": "gitlab-list-commits",
    "configurable_props": [
      {
        "name": "gitlab",
        "type": "app",
        "app": "gitlab"
      },
      {
        "name": "projectId",
        "type": "integer",
        "label": "Project ID",
        "description": "The project ID, as displayed in the main project page",
        "remoteOptions": true
      },
      {
        "name": "refName",
        "type": "string",
        "label": "Branch Name",
        "description": "The name of the branch",
        "remoteOptions": true,
        "optional": true
      },
      {
        "name": "max",
        "type": "integer",
        "label": "Max Results",
        "description": "Max number of results to return. Default value is `100`",
        "optional": true,
        "default": 100
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Using this information, you can now drive the configuration of the component for
your end users, as described in the next section.

### Configure the component

Component execution on behalf of your end users requires a few preliminary
steps, focused on getting the right input parameters (aka
[props](/workflows/using-props)) to the component.

Configuring each prop for a component often involves an API call to retrieve the possible values,
unless the values that a prop can take are static or free-form. The endpoint is accessible at:

```text
POST /v1/connect/components/configure
```

Typically, the options for a prop are linked to a specific user's account. Each
of these props implements an `options` method that retrieves the necessary
options from the third-party API, formats them, and sends them back in the
response for the end user to select. Examples are listing Slack channels, Google Sheets, etc.

The payload for the configuration API call must contain the following fields:

1. `external_user_id`: the ID of your user on your end
2. `id`: the component's unique ID (aka **key**)
3. `prop_name`: the name of the prop you want to configure
4. `configured_props`: an object containing the props that have already been
   configured. The initial configuration call must contain the ID of the account
   (aka `authProvisionId`) that your user has connected to the target app (see
   [this section](workflows#configure-accounts-to-use-your-end-users-auth) for
   more details on how to create these accounts).

We'll use the [**List Commits** component for
Gitlab](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/blob/master/components/gitlab/actions/list-commits/list-commits.mjs#L4)
as an example, to illustrate a call that retrieves the options for the
`projectId` prop of that component. The payload sent to the configuration API
would look like this:

```json
{
  "external_user_id": "demo-34c13d13-a31e-4a3d-8b63-0ac954671095",
  "id": "gitlab-list-commits",
  "prop_name": "projectId",
  "configured_props": {
    "gitlab": {
      "authProvisionId": "apn_oOhaBlD"
    }
  }
}
```

The response will contain the possible values (and their human-readable labels
when applicable) for the prop, as well as any possible errors that might have
occurred. The response for the request above would look like this:

```json
{
  "observations": [],
  "context": null,
  "options": [
    {
      "label": "jverce/foo-massive-10231-1",
      "value": 45672541
    },
    {
      "label": "jverce/foo-massive-10231",
      "value": 45672514
    },
    {
      "label": "jverce/foo-massive-14999-2",
      "value": 45672407
    },
    {
      "label": "jverce/foo-massive-14999-1",
      "value": 45672382
    },
    {
      "label": "jverce/foo-massive-14999",
      "value": 45672215
    },
    {
      "label": "jverce/gitlab-development-kit",
      "value": 21220953
    },
    {
      "label": "jverce/gitlab",
      "value": 21208123
    }
  ],
  "errors": [],
  "timings": {
    "api_to_sidekiq": 1734043172355.1042,
    "sidekiq_received": 1734043172357.867,
    "sidekiq_to_lambda": 1734043172363.6812,
    "sidekiq_done": 1734043173461.6406,
    "lambda_configure_prop_called": 1734043172462,
    "lambda_done": 1734043173455
  },
  "stringOptions": null
}
```

<Callout type="info">

Fields inside `configured_props` are written in camel case since they refer to
the names of props as they appear in the component's code, they are not
attributes that the API itself consumes.

</Callout>

You configure props one-by-one, making a call to the component configuration API
for each new prop. Subsequent prop configuration calls will be identical to the
one above:

1. Add the prop you currently want to configure as the `prop_name`
2. Include the names and values of all previously-configured props in the
   `configured_props` object. Keep this object in your app's local state, add a
   prop once you or the end user selects a value, and pass it to the
   `configured_props` API param.

For example, to retrieve the configuration options for the `refName` prop:

```json
{
  "async_handle": "IyvFeE5oNpYd",
  "external_user_id": "demo-34c13d13-a31e-4a3d-8b63-0ac954671095",
  "id": "gitlab-list-commits",
  "prop_name": "refName",
  "configured_props": {
    "gitlab": {
      "authProvisionId": "apn_oOhaBlD"
    },
    "projectId": 21208123
  }
}
```

### Configure dynamic props (optional)

The set of props that a component can accept might not be static, and may change
depending on the values of prior props. Props that behave this way are called
[dynamic props](/components/api#dynamic-props), and they need to be configured
in a different way. Props that are dynamic will have a `reloadProps` attribute
set to `true` in the component's code.

After configuring a dynamic prop, the set of subsequent props must be recomputed
(or reloaded), which is possible using the following API call:

```text
POST /v1/connect/components/props
```

The payload is similar to the one used for the configuration API, but it
excludes the `prop_name` field since the goal of this call is to reload and
retrieve the new set of props, not to configure a specific one.

Using the [Add Single Row action for Google Sheets](https://pipedream.com/apps/google-sheets/actions/add-single-row) as an example, the
request payload would look like this:

```json
{
  "async_handle": "PL41Yf3PuX61",
  "external_user_id": "demo-25092fa8-86c0-4d46-86c9-9dc9bde3b964",
  "id": "google_sheets-add-single-row",
  "configured_props": {
    "googleSheets": {
      "authProvisionId": "apn_V1hMoE7"
    },
    "sheetId": "1BfWjFF2dTW_YDiLISj5N9nKCUErShgugPS434liyytg"
  }
}
```

In this case, the `sheetId` prop is dynamic, and so after configuring it, the
set of props must be reloaded. The response will contain the new set of props
and their definition, similar to when the [component information was first
retrieved](#retrieving-a-components-definition). The response will also contain
an ID that can be used to reference the new set of props in subsequent
configuration calls. If this is ID is not provided, the set of props will be
based on the definition of the component that was retrieved initially.

To illustrate, the response for the request above would look like this:

```json
{
  "observations": [],
  "errors": [],
  "dynamicProps": {
    "id": "dyp_6xUyVgQ",
    "configurableProps": [
      {
        "name": "googleSheets",
        "type": "app",
        "app": "google_sheets"
      },
      {
        "name": "drive",
        "type": "string",
        "label": "Drive",
        "description": "Defaults to `My Drive`. To select a [Shared Drive](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310351) instead, select it from this list.",
        "optional": true,
        "default": "My Drive",
        "remoteOptions": true
      },
      {
        "name": "sheetId",
        "type": "string",
        "label": "Spreadsheet",
        "description": "The Spreadsheet ID",
        "useQuery": true,
        "remoteOptions": true,
        "reloadProps": true
      },
      {
        "name": "worksheetId",
        "type": "string[]",
        "label": "Worksheet(s)",
        "description": "Select a worksheet or enter a custom expression. When referencing a spreadsheet dynamically, you must provide a custom expression for the worksheet.",
        "remoteOptions": true,
        "reloadProps": true
      },
      {
        "name": "hasHeaders",
        "type": "boolean",
        "label": "Does the first row of the sheet have headers?",
        "description": "If the first row of your document has headers, we'll retrieve them to make it easy to enter the value for each column. Note: When using a dynamic reference for the worksheet ID (e.g. `{{steps.foo.$return_value}}`), this setting is ignored.",
        "reloadProps": true
      },
      {
        "name": "myColumnData",
        "type": "string[]",
        "label": "Values",
        "description": "Provide a value for each cell of the row. Google Sheets accepts strings, numbers and boolean values for each cell. To set a cell to an empty value, pass an empty string."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Execution

Once all the props have been configured, the component can be invoked. Pipedream
supports two types of components: [actions](/components#actions) and
[sources](/components#sources) (aka triggers).

Actions are components that perform a task by taking an input either during
[configuration](#configure-the-component) and/or during invocation (usually both), and
produce a result. Sources are very similar, but the difference is that they are
not invoked directly by Pipedream users, but rather by events that happen on a
third-party service. For example, the "New File" source for Google Drive will be
triggered every time a new file is created in a specific folder in Google Drive,
then will emit an event for you to consume.

All this means is that actions can be invoked manually on demand, while sources
are instead deployed and run automatically when the event they are listening for
occurs.

#### Invoking an action

At the end of the configuration process for an action, you'll end up with a
payload that you can use to invoke the action. The payload is similar to the one
used for configuring a prop, with the exception of the `prop_name` attribute
(because we're not configuring any props at this point):

```json
{
  "async_handle": "xFfBakdTGTkI",
  "external_user_id": "demo-20a1b80e-23a5-4d4d-a8ef-c91cdbd0dad9",
  "id": "gitlab-list-commits",
  "configured_props": {
    "gitlab": {
      "authProvisionId": "apn_JjhWOl0"
    },
    "projectId": 45672541,
    "refName": "main"
  }
}
```

To run the action with this configuration, simply send it as the request payload
to the following endpoint:

```text
POST /v1/connect/actions/run
```

The output of executing the action will be a JSON object containing the
following fields:

1. `exports`: all the named exports produced by the action, like when calling
   [`$.export` in a Node.js](/code/nodejs#using-export) component.
2. `os`: a list of observations produced by the action (e.g. logs, errors, etc).
3. `ret`: the return value of the action, if any.

The following (abbreviated) example shows the output of running the action
above:

```json
{
  "exports": {
    "$summary": "Retrieved 1 commit"
  },
  "os": [],
  "ret": [
    {
      "id": "387262aea5d4a6920ac76c1e202bc9fd0841fea5",
      "short_id": "387262ae",
      "created_at": "2023-05-03T03:03:25.000+00:00",
      "parent_ids": [],
      "title": "Initial commit",
      "message": "Initial commit",
      "author_name": "Jay Vercellone",
      "author_email": "nope@pipedream.com",
      "authored_date": "2023-05-03T03:03:25.000+00:00",
      "committer_name": "Jay Vercellone",
      "committer_email": "nope@pipedream.com",
      "committed_date": "2023-05-03T03:03:25.000+00:00",
      "trailers": {},
      "extended_trailers": {},
      "web_url": "https://gitlab.com/jverce/foo-massive-10231-1/-/commit/387262aea5d4a6920ac76c1e202bc9fd0841fea5"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Deploying a source

Because sources are exercised by events that happen on a third-party service,
their semantics are different from actions. Once a source is configured, it must
be deployed in order to start listening for events. You might be asking where do
those events go, and you'd be right to ask. That's the reason why when deploying
a source you must provide a URL where the source will send these events, similar
to how a webhook works.

Deploying a source is done by sending a payload similar to the one used for
running an action, with the addition of the webhook URL mentioned above. Using
the **New Issue (Instant)** source for Gitlab as an example, the payload would
look something like this:

```json
{
  "external_user_id": "demo-20a1b80e-23a5-4d4d-a8ef-c91cdbd0dad9",
  "id": "gitlab-new-issue",
  "prop_name": "http",
  "configured_props": {
    "gitlab": {
      "authProvisionId": "apn_kVh9AoD"
    },
    "projectId": 45672541
  },
  "webhook_url": "https://events.example.com/gitlab-new-issue"
}
```

The endpoint to deploy a source is:

```text
POST /v1/connect/triggers/deploy
```

If the source deployment succeeds, the response will contain the information
regarding the state of the source, including all the component's props metadata,
as well as their values. It will also contain its name, creation date, owner,
and most importantly its unique ID, which can be used to manage the source in
the future (e.g. delete it). The response for the request above would look like
this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "dc_dAuGmW7",
    "owner_id": "exu_oedidz",
    "component_id": "sc_3vijzQr",
    "configurable_props": [
      {
        "name": "gitlab",
        "type": "app",
        "app": "gitlab"
      },
      {
        "name": "db",
        "type": "$.service.db"
      },
      {
        "name": "http",
        "type": "$.interface.http",
        "customResponse": true
      },
      {
        "name": "projectId",
        "type": "integer",
        "label": "Project ID",
        "description": "The project ID, as displayed in the main project page",
        "remoteOptions": true
      }
    ],
    "configured_props": {
      "gitlab": {
        "authProvisionId": "apn_kVh9AoD"
      },
      "db": {
        "type": "$.service.db"
      },
      "http": {
        "endpoint_url": "https://xxxxxxxxxx.m.pipedream.net"
      },
      "projectId": 45672541
    },
    "active": true,
    "created_at": 1734028283,
    "updated_at": 1734028283,
    "name": "My first project - exu_oedidz",
    "name_slug": "my-first-project---exu-oedidz-2"
  }
}
```

In the example above, the source ID is `dc_dAuGmW7`, which can be used to delete
the source in the future:

```text
DELETE /v1/connect/deployed-triggers/dc_dAuGmW7?external_user_id=demo-20a1b80e-23a5-4d4d-a8ef-c91cdbd0dad9
```

</Steps>
