# Troubleshooting

Below are some common errors when connecting your users' accounts via Pipedream Connect.

### Error creating a Connect token

>Error creating token: Error: Failed to obtain OAuth token: Response Error: 401 Unauthorized

Authorization to the Pipedream API failed when creating the Connect token. Double-check the client ID or secret for your [Pipedream OAuth client](/connect/api#authentication).

### Error connecting an account

Most errors when connecting an account are related to the [Connect token](/connect/tokens), which Pipedream validates from the Connect iFrame.

#### Common errors

>This link has expired. Please request a new one from the app developer.

>This session has expired. Please refresh the page to try again.

#### Troubleshooting steps

Pipedream typically returns an explicit error message in the HTTP response of the token validation network call directly from the iFrame in the client. To check for errors, start the account connection flow in a browser and open the developer console to view the network requests. 

Filter for requests to 

```
https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/tokens
```

and check the response for error messages.

#### Token validation errors

>The Pipedream Connect token is invalid. Please generate a new one and try again.

Connect tokens expire, and are only able to be used once. Try generating a new token and try again.

>App not found. Please check your app id.

Double-check the app slug you're passing [when connecting your user's account](/connect/quickstart#connect-your-users-account).

### Connection failed. Please retry or contact support.

The user may have closed the OAuth popup window without completing authorization.
