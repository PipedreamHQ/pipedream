# Environments

Pipedream Connect projects support two environments: `development` and `production`.

1. Connected accounts and credentials stored in `development` remain separate from `production`.
2. In `development`, you can use the official Pipedream OAuth apps, so you can test integrations without creating your own OAuth client.

## How to specify environment

You specify the environment when [creating a new Connect token](/connect/api/#create-a-new-token) with the Pipedream SDK or API. By default, the enviromment is set to `production`. When users succesfully connect their account, Pipedream saves it for that `external_user_id` in the specified environment.

You can set the environment when you create the SDK client:

```typescript
import { createBackendClient } from "@pipedream/sdk";

const pd = createBackendClient({
  environment: "development", // change to production if running for a test production account, or in production
  credentials: {
    clientId: "your-oauth-client-id",
    clientSecret: "your-oauth-client-secret",
  }
});
```

or pass the `X-PD-Environment` header in HTTP requests:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/{project_id}/tokens \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-PD-Environment: development" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -d '{
    "external_user_id": "your-external-user-id"
  }'
```
