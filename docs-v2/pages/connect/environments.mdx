# Environments

Pipedream Connect projects support two environments: `development` and `production`.

1. Connected accounts and credentials stored in `development` remain separate from `production`.
2. In `development`, you can use the official Pipedream OAuth clients, so you can test integrations without creating your own OAuth client, and you can also use features that are typically only available on higher paid tiers, like [running workflows on behalf of your end users](/connect/workflows).

<Callout type="warning">
When connecting an account in `development`, make sure you're signed in to pipedream.com in the same browser where you're connecting your account. This is only a requirement for the `development` environment.
</Callout>

## How to specify environment

You specify the environment when [creating a new Connect token](/connect/api/#create-a-new-token) with the Pipedream SDK or API. By default, the enviromment is set to `production`. When users succesfully connect their account, Pipedream saves it for that `external_user_id` in the specified environment.

Always set the environment when you create the SDK client:

```typescript
import { createBackendClient } from "@pipedream/sdk/server";

const pd = createBackendClient({
  environment: "development", // change to production if running for a test production account, or in production
  credentials: {
    clientId: "your-oauth-client-id",
    clientSecret: "your-oauth-client-secret",
  }
});
```

or pass the `X-PD-Environment` header in HTTP requests:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/{project_id}/tokens \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-PD-Environment: development" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -d '{
    "external_user_id": "your-external-user-id"
  }'
```
