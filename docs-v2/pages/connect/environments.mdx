# Environments

Pipedream Connect projects support two environments: `development` and `production`. Connected accounts and credentials stored in `development` remain separate from `production`.

<Callout type="info">
Pipedream customers on any plan can use all of the Connect features in `development` mode. To use Connect in `production`, click **Contact Sales** [here](https://pipedream.com/pricing?plan=Enterprise) to get in touch with our team.
</Callout>


## How to specify the environment

You specify the environment when [creating a new Connect token](/connect/api/#create-a-new-token) with the Pipedream SDK or API. When users succesfully connect their account, Pipedream saves the account credentials (API key, access token, etc) for that `external_user_id` in the specified environment.

Always set the environment when you create the SDK client:

```typescript
import { createBackendClient } from "@pipedream/sdk/server";

const pd = createBackendClient({
  environment: "development", // change to production if running for a test production account, or in production
  credentials: {
    clientId: "your-oauth-client-id",
    clientSecret: "your-oauth-client-secret",
  }
});
```

or pass the `X-PD-Environment` header in HTTP requests:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/{project_id}/tokens \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-PD-Environment: development" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -d '{
    "external_user_id": "your-external-user-id"
  }'
```

<Callout type="warning">
When connecting an account in `development`, make sure you're signed in to pipedream.com in the same browser where you're connecting your account. This is only a requirement for the `development` environment. **You should only use `development` with your own accounts when testing and developing, and not with your end users.**
