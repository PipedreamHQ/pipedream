# Migrating to the 1.0 SDK

<Callout>
This guide is only relevant if:

- You used the `0.x` version of the JavaScript SDK
- You authenticated with the Pipedream API using project keys
</Callout>

## What changed

- In the `0.x` version of the SDK and the original Connect API, you could authenticate with keys scoped to a specific project. In the `1.x` version of the SDK, you need to authenticate with [OAuth clients](/rest-api/auth#oauth).
- The `createClient` method from both the browser and Node.js SDKs has been replaced with separate methods: `createFrontendClient` and `createBackendClient`, respectively.
- The `connectTokenCreate` method has been renamed `createConnectToken`
- New SDK methods: `projectInfo`, `invokeWorkflow`, and more

## How to migrate

<Steps>

### Create an OAuth client

Follow the instructions [here](/rest-api/auth#oauth) to create an OAuth client.

### Update your SDK version

Change the `@pipedream/sdk` version in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@pipedream/sdk": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

Then run

```bash
npm install
```

### Update your project key references to use your OAuth client

You may have been referencing project keys in environment variables or other config. Replace these with references to the OAuth client you created in step 1.

For example, `process.env.PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_KEY` should be replaced with `process.env.PIPEDREAM_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, and `process.env.PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_SECRET` should be replaced with `process.env.PIPEDREAM_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`.

### Update your SDK code

#### Frontend client

You'll need to make two changes to your frontend client code:

1. Replace references to `@pipedream/sdk/browser`. Instead, import directly from `@pipedream/sdk`.
2. Change the `createClient` method to `createFrontendClient`.

```typescript
import { createFrontendClient } from "@pipedream/sdk"
const pd = createFrontendClient()
```

#### Backend client

You'll need to make three changes to your backend code:

1. Change the `createClient` method to `createBackendClient`.
2. Pass your OAuth client ID and secret to the `createBackendClient` method, removing references to project keys.
3. Change any token create method references from `connectTokenCreate` to `createConnectToken`.
