# Configuring Your application

By default, your end users will see this screen when they connect their account (to Google Sheets in this example):

<Image src="https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1731024264/connect-standard-gsheets_fonwrx.png" alt="Pipedream Connect" width={300} height={529} />

To customize this screen, you can configure your [application name](#application-name), [support email](#support-email), and [logo](#logo) in the Pipedream UI.

## Customizing your application details

Open your project in the Pipedream UI: [https://pipedream.com/projects](https://pipedream.com/projects)

1. Once you've opened your project, click the **Connect** tab in the left sidebar
2. From there, select the **Configuration** tab

### Application name
By default, your end users will see:
>We use Pipedream to connect your account

Enter the name of your application that you'd like to show instead, so it'll read:
>\{Application Name\} uses Pipedream to connect your account

### Support email
In the case of any errors during the account connection flow, by default your users will see:
>Connection failed. Please retry or contact support.

To give your end users an email address to seek support, enter your support email. We'll display it:
>Connection failed. Please retry or contact support [help@example.com](mailto:help@example.com).

### Logo
By default we'll show Pipedream's logo alongside the app your use is connecting to. If you'd like to show your own logo instead, you can upload it here.
