# API Reference
After your end users have connected their account using Pipedream Connect, you can retrieve their credentials using Pipedream's REST API, which enables you to make authenticated requests on their behalf.

## Overview
The base URL for all Connect requests is `https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect`.

You authenticate to the Connect REST API using **Basic Auth**. Send your Pipedream [Project Public Key]() as the username and the [Project Secret Key]() as the password. When you make API requests, pass an
`Authorization` header of the following format:

```
Authorization: Basic <Base 64 encoded public_key:secret_key>
```

For example, here's how you can use `cURL` to fetch a list of all accounts in your project:

```shell
curl 'https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/accounts' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <Base 64 encoded public_key:secret_key>'
```
