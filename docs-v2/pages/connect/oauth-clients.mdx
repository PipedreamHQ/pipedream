# OAuth Clients

When connecting an account for any OAuth app via Pipedream Connect, we'll default to using Pipedream's official OAuth client, which enables you to quickly get up and running. [Read more about OAuth clients in Pipedream here](/connected-accounts/oauth-clients).

## Using Pipedream OAuth

There are two types of apps in Pipedream:

1. **Key-based**: These apps require static credentials, like API keys. Pipedream stores these credentials securely and exposes them via API.
2. **OAuth**: These apps require OAuth authorization. Pipedream manages the OAuth flow for these apps, ensuring you always have a fresh access token for requests.

**OAuth apps require you create your own OAuth client to [deploy Connect to production](/connect/environments):**

<Callout type="info">
To get started in [development mode](/connect/environments), you can skip these steps. To deploy your app to production, you'll need to [create an OAuth client](#using-a-custom-oauth-client) for the app you're integrating.
</Callout>

## Using a custom OAuth client

1. Follow the steps [here](/connected-accounts/oauth-clients#configuring-custom-oauth-clients) to create an OAuth client in Pipedream.
2. Open the **Apps** tab within your Pipedream project and select **Add app**.
3. Select the app you're looking for, then select your OAuth client from the dropdown menu.
4. When connecting an account either via the [frontend SDK](/connect/quickstart#use-the-pipedream-sdk-in-your-frontend), make sure to include the `oauth_app_id` in `pd.connectAccount()`.
5. If using [Connect Link](/connect/quickstart#use-connect-link), make sure to include the `oauth_app_id` in the URL.
