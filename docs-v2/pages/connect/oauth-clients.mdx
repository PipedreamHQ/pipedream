# OAuth Clients

When connecting an account for any OAuth app via Pipedream Connect, we'll default to using Pipedream's official OAuth client, which enables you to quick get up and running. [Read more about OAuth clients in Pipedream here](/connected-accounts/oauth-clients).

## Using a custom OAuth client
1. Follow the steps outlined [here](/connected-accounts/oauth-clients#configuring-custom-oauth-clients) to create an OAuth client in Pipedream.
2. Open the **Apps** tab within your Pipedream project and select **Add app**.
3. Select the app you're looking for, then select the OAuth client from the dropdown menu 
4. When connecting an account either via the [frontend SDK](/connect/quickstart#use-the-pipedream-sdk-in-your-frontend) or using [Connect Link](/connect/quickstart#use-connect-link), make sure to include the `oauth_app_id` in the request.

## Finding your OAuth app ID
[Create your OAuth client in Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/@/accounts/oauth-clients) then click the arrow to the left of the client name to expand the details.
