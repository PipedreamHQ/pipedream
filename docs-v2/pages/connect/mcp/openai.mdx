# Using Pipedream MCP with OpenAI

Access {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs and 10,000+ tools in OpenAI using Pipedream MCP with the [OpenAI Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools?api-mode=responses). MCP makes it easy to extend the capabilties of your app or agent, and Pipedream offers drop-in support with OpenAI.

<Callout type="info">
Pipedream MCP includes built-in user authentication for [every integrated API](https://pipedream.com/apps/), which means you don't need to build any authorization flows or think about token storage or refresh.
</Callout>

## Getting Started
To use Pipedream MCP with your own users, you need the following:

1. A [Pipedream account](https://pipedream.com/auth/signup)
2. A [Pipedream project](/projects/#creating-projects). Accounts connected via MCP will be stored here.
3. [Pipedream OAuth credentials](/rest-api/auth/#oauth)

<Callout type="info">
These are requiremnents for you, the developer. Your users do **not** need to sign up for Pipedream in order to connect their accounts in your app or agent.
</Callout>

#### Set up environment variables

Set the following environment variables (learn more about environments in Pipedream Connect [here](/connect/managed-auth/environments/)):

```bash
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

### Examples

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { createBackendClient } from "@pipedream/sdk/server";

const externalUserId = "abc-123" // Unique ID in your system to identify the user

// Initialize the Pipedream SDK
const pd = createBackendClient({
  credentials: {
    clientId: PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET,
  },
  environment: PIPEDREAM_ENVIRONMENT,
  projectId: PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID,
});

const { token } = await pd.createConnectToken({
  external_user_id: externalUserId,
})

const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-4.1",
  tools: [
    {
      "type": "mcp",
      "server_label": "Notion",
      "server_url": `https://mcp.pipedream.net/${externalUserId}/notion`,
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${token}`
      }
      "require_approval": "never"
    },
  ],
  input: "Summarize my most recently created Notion doc for me and help draft an email to our customers"
})

console.log(response);
```

## Account Connection

One of the core features of Pipedream Connect and MCP is the ability for your users to easily connect their accounts without having to build any of the authorization flow or handle token storage, etc.

You can handle account connections in a couple different ways in your app:

1. Add the [frontend Pipedream SDK](/connect/managed-auth/quickstart/#use-the-pipedream-sdk-in-your-frontend) to your app, let users connect their account directly in your UI.
2. Return a [Connect Link URL](/connect/managed-auth/quickstart/#or-use-connect-link) to your users from the LLM response.
