# Using Pipedream MCP with OpenAI

Access {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs and 10,000+ tools in OpenAI using Pipedream MCP with the [OpenAI Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools?api-mode=responses). MCP makes it easy to extend the capabilties of any LLM or agent, and Pipedream offers drop-in support for OpenAI.

<Callout type="info">
Pipedream MCP includes built-in user authentication for [every integrated API](https://pipedream.com/apps/), which means you don't need to build any authorization flows or think about token storage or refresh. [Learn more here](#account-connection).
</Callout>

## Getting Started
To use Pipedream MCP with your own users, you need the following:

1. A [Pipedream account](https://pipedream.com/auth/signup)
2. A [Pipedream project](/projects/#creating-projects). Accounts connected via MCP will be stored here.
3. [Pipedream OAuth credentials](/rest-api/auth/#oauth)

<Callout type="info">
These are requiremnents for you, the developer. Your users do **not** need to sign up for Pipedream in order to connect their accounts in your app or agent.
</Callout>

#### Set up environment variables

Set the following environment variables (learn more about environments in Pipedream Connect [here](/connect/managed-auth/environments/)):

```bash
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
PIPEDREAM_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

### Examples

<Tabs.Tab> 
```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { createBackendClient } from "@pipedream/sdk/server";

const externalUserId = "abc-123" // Unique ID in your system to identify the user

// Initialize the Pipedream SDK
const pd = createBackendClient({
  credentials: {
    clientId: PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET,
  },
  environment: PIPEDREAM_ENVIRONMENT,
  projectId: PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID,
});

const { token } = await pd.createConnectToken({
  external_user_id: externalUserId,
})

const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-4.1",
  tools: [

## Account Connection

One of the core features of Pipedream Connect and our MCP product is the ability for your users to easily connect their accounts without having to build any of the authorization flow or handle token storage, etc.

You can handle account connections in one of two ways in your app:

### Add a button in your UI
- Use Pipedream's [frontend SDK](/connect/managed-auth/quickstart/#use-the-pipedream-sdk-in-your-frontend) to let users connect their account directly in your UI
- You can see an example of this when you connect any account in [mcp.pipedream.com](https://mcp.pipedream.com)

### Return a link
- Use [Connect Link ](/connect/managed-auth/quickstart/#or-use-connect-link) to let your users open a Pipedream hosted page to connect their account
- There isn't any implementation required for this option since it's already handled in Pipedream's MCP server
- If a user doesn't have a connected account that's required for a given tool call, we'll return a URL in the tool call response. For example:

```
https://pipedream.com/_static/connect.html?token=ctok_xxxxxxx&connectLink=true&app=notion
```
