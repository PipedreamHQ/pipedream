# Using Pipedream MCP with OpenAI

Access {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs and 10,000+ tools in OpenAI using Pipedream Connect. MCP makes it easy to extend the capabilities of any LLM or agent, and Pipedream offers drop-in support for [calling tools in OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools?api-mode=responses) .

<Callout type="info">
Pipedream Connect includes built-in user authentication for [every MCP server](https://mcp.pipedream.com), which means you don't need to build any authorization flows or deal with token storage and refresh in order to make authenticated requests on behalf of your users. [Learn more here](/connect/mcp/developers/#user-account-connections).
</Callout>

## Getting started

<Steps>

### Set up your environment

To use Pipedream MCP with your own users, you need the following:

1. A [Pipedream account](https://pipedream.com/auth/signup)
2. A [Pipedream project](/projects/#creating-projects) (accounts connected via MCP will be stored here)
3. [Pipedream OAuth credentials](/rest-api/auth/#oauth)

<Callout type="info">
These are requirements for you, the developer. Your users do **not** need to sign up for Pipedream in order to connect their accounts in your app or agent.
</Callout>

Now set the following environment variables (learn more about environments in Pipedream Connect [here](/connect/managed-auth/environments/)):

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id # proj_xxxxxxx
PIPEDREAM_ENVIRONMENT=development # development | production
```

### Discover available MCP servers

[See here](/connect/mcp/developers/#discover-available-mcp-servers) for guidance on discovering the apps Pipedream has available as MCP servers.

### Generate a model response in OpenAI with Pipedream MCP

Below is an end to end example showing how to:
1. Initialize the Pipedream SDK
2. Find the relevant MCP server
3. Send a prompt to OpenAI with the MCP server as a tool call

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'cURL']}>
<Tabs.Tab> 
```javascript
import OpenAI from 'openai';
import { createBackendClient } from "@pipedream/sdk/server";

// Initialize the Pipedream client with the SDK
const pd = createBackendClient({
  environment: PIPEDREAM_ENVIRONMENT,
  credentials: {
    clientId: PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET,
  },
  projectId: PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID
});

// Find the app to use for the MCP server
// For this example, we'll use Notion
const apps = await pd.getApps({ q: "notion" });
const appSlug = apps.data[0].name_slug; // e.g., "notion"

// Get access token for MCP server auth
const accessToken = await pd.rawAccessToken();

// Send the unique ID that you use to identify this user in your system
const externalUserId = 'abc-123'; // Used in MCP URL to identify the user

// Initialize OpenAI client
const client = new OpenAI();

// Make the OpenAI request with the MCP server
const response = await client.responses.create({
  model: 'gpt-4.1',
  tools: [
    {
      type: 'mcp',
      server_label: 'Notion',
      server_url: `https://remote.mcp.pipedream.net/${externalUserId}/${appSlug}`,
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
        "x-pd-project-id": PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID,
        "x-pd-environment": PIPEDREAM_ENVIRONMENT
      },
      require_approval: 'never'
    }
  ],
  input: 'Summarize my most recently created Notion doc for me and help draft an email to our customers'
});

console.log(response);
```
