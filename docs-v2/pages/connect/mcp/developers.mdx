# Add Pipedream MCP to your app or agent

Add Pipedream's MCP server to your application or agent to make tool calls on behalf of your users to {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs and 10,000+ tools.

## Overview

Pipedream's MCP server code is [publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/blob/master/modelcontextprotocol/README.md), and you have two options for using Pipedream's MCP server in your app:

1. [Use Pipedream's remote MCP server](#use-pipedreams-remote-mcp-server)
2. [Self-host Pipedream's MCP server](#self-host-pipedreams-mcp-server)

<Callout type="info">
**Try out Pipedream MCP in our demo app: [chat.pipedream.com](https://chat.pipedream.com)**
</Callout>

### Pipedream concepts to understand

The MCP server accepts two route params:

**`external_user_id`**

- This is your user’s ID, in your system: whatever you use to uniquely identify them
- Requests made for that user ID are coupled to that end user and their connected accounts ([learn more](/connect/api/#external-users))

**`app`**

- The app's "name slug" (the unique identifier for the app)
- [See below](#discover-available-mcp-servers) for learn how to discover available apps

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

To use either the remote or self-hosted MCP server, you'll need:

1. A [Pipedream account](https://pipedream.com/auth/signup)
2. A [Pipedream project](/projects/#creating-projects). Accounts connected via MCP will be stored here.
3. [Pipedream OAuth credentials](/rest-api/auth/#oauth)

#### Set up your environment

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id # proj_xxxxxxx
PIPEDREAM_ENVIRONMENT=development # development | production
```

Learn more about [environments in Pipedream Connect](/connect/managed-auth/environments).

### Authentication

#### Developer authentication

Your application authenticates with Pipedream using client credential OAuth. [See below](#api-authentication) for details.

#### User account connections

One of the core features of Pipedream Connect and our MCP product is the ability for your users to easily connect their accounts without having to build any of the authorization flow or handle token storage.

You can handle account connections in one of two ways in your app:

##### Add a button in your UI
- Use Pipedream's [frontend SDK](/connect/managed-auth/quickstart/#use-the-pipedream-sdk-in-your-frontend) to let users connect their account directly in your UI
- You can see an example of this when you connect any account in [mcp.pipedream.com](https://mcp.pipedream.com)

##### Return a link
- Use [Connect Link ](/connect/managed-auth/quickstart/#or-use-connect-link) to let your users open a Pipedream hosted page to connect their account
- There's no implementation required for this option since it's already handled by Pipedream's MCP server
- If a user doesn't have a connected account that's required for a given tool call, the server will return a URL in the tool call response:

```
https://pipedream.com/_static/connect.html?token=ctok_xxxxxxx&connectLink=true&app={appSlug}
```

### Discover available MCP servers

Pipedream provides [{process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs as MCP servers](https://mcp.pipedream.com). Each server corresponds to an app integration (like Notion, Gmail, or Slack) and has its own specific set of tools that you can expose to OpenAI.

<Tabs items={['List all apps', 'Search for a specific app']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
import { createBackendClient } from "@pipedream/sdk/server";

// Initialize the Pipedream SDK client
const pd = createBackendClient({
  environment: PIPEDREAM_ENVIRONMENT,
  credentials: {
    clientId: PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET,
  },
  projectId: PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID
});

// Get all available apps (paginated)
const apps = await pd.getApps();

// Each app has these key properties:
// - name_slug: Used in the MCP server URL (e.g., "notion", "gmail", "slack")
// - name: Display name (e.g., "Notion", "Gmail", "Slack")
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
import { createBackendClient } from "@pipedream/sdk/server";

// Initialize the Pipedream SDK client
const pd = createBackendClient({
  environment: PIPEDREAM_ENVIRONMENT,
  credentials: {
    clientId: PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET,
  },
  projectId: PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID
});

// Search by app name
const notionApps = await pd.getApps({ q: "notion" });
const gmailApps = await pd.getApps({ q: "gmail" });
const slackApps = await pd.getApps({ q: "slack" });
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Supported Tool Modes

Pipedream MCP supports two methods for interacting with tools:

1. [Sub-agent](#sub-agent-mode) (default)
2. [Tools only](#tools-only-mode)

#### Sub-agent mode

When using Pipedream MCP with sub-agent mode enabled (default confiuration), all of the tools that you expose to your LLM take only a single input: **`instructions`**.

The Pipedream MCP server passes that **instructions** prompt to an LLM where we farm out the configuration of the main tool using a set of agents with narrowly scoped sets of instructions and additional tools to aid in the configuration and execution of the top-level tool.

- The benefit with this approach is that sub-agent mode abstracts a lot of the complexity with handling things like [remote options](/connect/components/#configure-the-component) and [dynamic props](/connect/components/#configure-dynamic-props), especially for MCP clients that don't automatically [reload tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools#tool-discovery-and-updates).
- However, one downside is that you hand over some of the control and observability to Pipedream in this model.

<Callout type="warning">
While Pipedream currently eats the costs of the LLM tokens in sub-agent mode while in Beta, we'll likely charge for the LLM usage in the future.
</Callout>

#### Tools only mode

To handle all tool configuration and calling yourself, you should use `tools-only` mode.

### Use Pipedream's remote MCP server

<Callout type="info">
The remote MCP server is in beta, and we're looking for feedback. During the beta, the API is subject to change.
</Callout>

#### Supported transport types

The Pipedream MCP server supports both SSE and streamable HTTP transport types dynamically, with no configuration required by the developer or MCP client.

#### Base URL

```
https://remote.mcp.pipedream.net
```

#### API Authentication

To authenticate requests to Pipedream's MCP server, you need to include an access token with every HTTP request. Here's how to get it:

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'cURL']}>
<Tabs.Tab> 
```javascript
import { createBackendClient } from "@pipedream/sdk/server";

// Initialize the Pipedream SDK client
const pd = createBackendClient({
  environment: PIPEDREAM_ENVIRONMENT,
  credentials: {
    clientId: PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET,
  },
  projectId: PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID
});

// Get access token for MCP server auth
const accessToken = await pd.rawAccessToken();

console.log(accessToken);
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.pipedream.com/v1/oauth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "grant_type": "client_credentials", 
    "client_id": "'$PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID'", 
    "client_secret": "'$PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET'"
  }'
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Required headers

Include these headers in every HTTP request:

```javascript
{
  "Authorization": `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
  "x-pd-project-id": PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID, // proj_xxxxxxx
  "x-pd-environment": PIPEDREAM_ENVIRONMENT // development | production
}
```

Example request:

```javascript
import { StreamableHTTPClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/streamableHttp.js";
import { createBackendClient } from "@pipedream/sdk/server";

// Initialize the Pipedream SDK client
const pd = createBackendClient({
  environment: PIPEDREAM_ENVIRONMENT,
  credentials: {
    clientId: PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET,
  },
  projectId: PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID
});

// Retrieve your developer access token via the Pipedream SDK
const accessToken = await pd.rawAccessToken();
const serverUrl = MCP_SERVER_URL || `https://remote.mcp.pipedream.net/${externalUserId}/${appSlug}`;

const transport = new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(new URL(serverUrl), {
  requestInit: {
    headers: {
      "Authorization": `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      "x-pd-project-id": PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID, // proj_xxxxxxx
      "x-pd-environment": PIPEDREAM_ENVIRONMENT // development | production
    }
  }
});
```

### Self-host Pipedream's MCP server

Hosting the MCP server locally or in your app will expose these routes:

- `GET /:external_user_id/:app`: app-specific connection endpoint
- `POST /:external_user_id/:app/messages`: app-specific message handler

#### Using the `Dockerfile`

You can build and run the container from the [reference implementation](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/blob/master/modelcontextprotocol/Dockerfile):

```console
> docker build -t pipedream-connect .
> docker run -d --name pd-mcp -p 3010:3010 --env-file .env pipedream-connect:latest
```

#### Running the server using npx

```bash
npx @pipedream/mcp sse
```

<Callout type="warning">
The current npx package only supports the `sse` transport type, `http` is coming soon.
</Callout>

#### Running the server locally

You can also run the server locally and even customize the MCP server for your specific requirements:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream
cd pipedream/modelcontextprotocol

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the server
pnpm dev:http
```

See the [MCP server README](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/blob/master/modelcontextprotocol/README.md) for detailed instructions on customization options.

#### Debugging

You can use the optional env var `PD_SDK_DEBUG` to print out all the requests and responses going to the Connect API:

```bash
PD_SDK_DEBUG=true pnpm dev:http
```

### Using the MCP inspector

The [MCP inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) can be helpful when debugging tool calls.

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

Enter the server URL:

If using Pipedream's remote server:

```
https://remote.mcp.pipedream.net/{external_user_id}/{app_slug}
```

If running locally:

```
http://localhost:3010/{external_user_id}/{app_slug}
```
