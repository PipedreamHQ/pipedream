# Add Pipedream MCP to your app or agent

Add Pipedream's MCP server to your application or agent to make tool calls on behalf of your users to {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs and 10,000+ tools.

## Overview

Pipedream's MCP server code is [publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/blob/master/modelcontextprotocol/README.md), and you have two options for using Pipedream's MCP server in your app:

1. [Use Pipedream's remote MCP server](#use-pipedreams-remote-mcp-server)
2. [Self-host Pipedream's MCP server](#self-host-pipedreams-mcp-server)

### Pipedream concepts to understand

The MCP server accepts two route params:

**`external_user_id`**

- This is your userâ€™s ID, in your system: whatever you use to uniquely identify them
- Any requests made to that route are coupled to that end user and uses the connected account tied to that user
- [See here](/connect/api/#external-users) for more detail

**`app`**

- The app's "name slug" (the unique identifier for the app)
- [See below](#discover-available-mcp-servers) for discovering available apps

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

For either option, you'll need:

1. A [Pipedream account](https://pipedream.com/auth/signup)
2. A [Pipedream project](/projects/#creating-projects). Accounts connected via MCP will be stored here.
3. [Pipedream OAuth credentials](/rest-api/auth/#oauth)

#### Set up your environment

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id # proj_xxxxxxx
PIPEDREAM_ENVIRONMENT=development # development | production
```

### Authentication

#### Developer authentication

Your application authenticates with Pipedream using client credential OAuth. [See below](#api-authentication) for details.

#### User account connections

One of the core features of Pipedream Connect and our MCP product is the ability for your users to easily connect their accounts without having to build any of the authorization flow or handle token storage.

You can handle account connections in one of two ways in your app:

##### Add a button in your UI
- Use Pipedream's [frontend SDK](/connect/managed-auth/quickstart/#use-the-pipedream-sdk-in-your-frontend) to let users connect their account directly in your UI
- You can see an example of this when you connect any account in [mcp.pipedream.com](https://mcp.pipedream.com)

##### Return a link
- Use [Connect Link ](/connect/managed-auth/quickstart/#or-use-connect-link) to let your users open a Pipedream hosted page to connect their account
- There is no implementation required for this option since it's already handled in Pipedream's MCP server
- If a user doesn't have a connected account that's required for a given tool call, we'll return a URL in the tool call response. For example:

```
https://pipedream.com/_static/connect.html?token=ctok_xxxxxxx&connectLink=true&app={appSlug}
```

### Discover available MCP servers

Pipedream provides [{process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs as MCP servers](https://mcp.pipedream.com). Each server corresponds to an app integration (like Notion, Gmail, or Slack) and has its own specific set of tools that you can expose to OpenAI.

<Tabs items={['List all apps', 'Search for a specific app']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
// Get all available apps (paginated)
const apps = await pd.getApps();

// Each app has these key properties:
// - name_slug: Used in the MCP server URL (e.g., "notion", "gmail", "slack")
// - name: Display name (e.g., "Notion", "Gmail", "Slack")
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
// Search by app name
const notionApps = await pd.getApps({ q: "notion" });
const gmailApps = await pd.getApps({ q: "gmail" });
const slackApps = await pd.getApps({ q: "slack" });
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Use Pipedream's remote MCP server

<Callout type="info">
Pipedream MCP server supports both SSE and streamable HTTP transport types, with no configuration required by the developer or MCP client.
</Callout>

#### Base URL

```
https://mcp.pipedream.net
```

#### API Authentication

To authenticate requests to Pipedream's MCP server, you need to include an access token with every HTTP request. Here's how to get it:

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'cURL']}>
<Tabs.Tab> 
```javascript
import { createBackendClient } from "@pipedream/sdk/server";

// Initialize the Pipedream client with the SDK
const pd = createBackendClient({
  environment: PIPEDREAM_ENVIRONMENT,
  credentials: {
    clientId: PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET,
  },
  projectId: PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID
});

// Get access token for MCP server auth
const accessToken = await pd.rawAccessToken();

console.log(accessToken);
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.pipedream.com/v1/oauth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "grant_type": "client_credentials", 
    "client_id": "'$PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID'", 
    "client_secret": "'$PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET'"
  }'
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Required headers

Include these headers in every HTTP request:

```javascript
{
  Authorization: `Bearer ${PIPEDREAM_ACCESS_TOKEN}`,
  "x-pd-project-id": PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID, // proj_xxxxxxx
  "x-pd-environment": PIPEDREAM_ENVIRONMENT // development | production
}
```

### Self-host Pipedream's MCP server

#### Using the `Dockerfile`

If you have Docker installed locally, you can build and run the container from the [reference implementation](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/blob/master/modelcontextprotocol/Dockerfile):

```console
> docker build -t pipedream-connect .
> docker run -d --name pd-mcp -p 3010:3010 --env-file .env pipedream-connect:latest
```

This exposes a generic MCP server at [http://localhost:3010/:external_user_id/:app](http://localhost:3010/:external_user_id/:app).

#### Start the server with Streamable HTTP Transport

```bash
pnpm dev:http
```

You can use the optional env var `PD_SDK_DEBUG` to print out all the requests and responses going to the Connect API:

```bash
PD_SDK_DEBUG=true pnpm dev:http
```

#### Start the server with SSE

```bash
npx @pipedream/mcp sse
```

This exposes routes at:
- `GET /:external_user_id/:app` - App-specific SSE connection endpoint
- `POST /:external_user_id/:app/messages` - App-specific message handler

#### Customize for your needs

You can also host and customize the MCP server for your specific requirements:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream
cd pipedream/modelcontextprotocol

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Run the SSE server
npm run start:sse:prod
```

See the [MCP server README](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/blob/master/modelcontextprotocol/README.md) for detailed instructions on customization options.

### Use the MCP inspector

The [MCP inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) can be helpful when debugging tool calls.

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

Enter the server URL:

If using Pipedream's remote server:

```
https://mcp.pipedream.net/{external_user_id}/{app_slug}
```

If running locally:

```
http://localhost:3010/{external_user_id}/{app_slug}
```
