# Using Pipedream MCP as an end user

Set up MCP servers to use with any compatible MCP client, like Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Cursor, and VS Code.

<Steps>

#### Configure MCP servers and connect accounts

- Navigate to [mcp.pipedream.com](https://mcp.pipedream.com) and sign in or create an account (this is a separate account from pipdream.com)
- Browse available MCP servers
- Follow the configuration instructions on the server page to add it to your preferred MCP client
- Connect your account (you can do this in the UI or the AI will prompt you when you first use a tool)

#### Start chatting

Ask the LLM or agent to perform tasks using your connected services. For example:

- "Send a message to my team in Slack"
- "Create a new issue in GitHub"
- "Add data to my Google Sheet"

The AI will refer to the configured tools available in its MCP servers to complete the task.

#### Get things done

With MCP-enabled AI, you can:

- Send messages and manage communication
- Create and update documents
- Query and analyze data
- Automate workflows across your favorite tools

All using your own connected accounts with full control and security.
