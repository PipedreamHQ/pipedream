# MCP Servers

Pipedream offers dedicated MCP ([Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)) servers for all of our {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ integrated apps. These servers enable AI assistants like Claude to securely access and interact with thousands of APIs through a standardized communication protocol, performing real-world tasks using your or your users' accounts.

Pipedream's MCP servers are powered by [Pipedream Connect](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect) and include:

- Access to {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ apps and APIs through a consistent interface
- Over 10,000 pre-built tools
- Fully-managed OAuth and secure credential storage

<Callout type="info">
User credentials are encrypted at rest and all requests are made through Pipedream's servers, never directly exposing credentials to AI models. Read more about how we protect user credentials [here](/privacy-and-security/#third-party-oauth-grants-api-keys-and-environment-variables).

## Available MCP servers

Pipedream provides MCP servers for all our [supported apps](https://mcp.pipedream.com/). Each app has its own dedicated MCP server with tools specific to that API. For example:

## Security

Like the rest of Pipedream Connect, MCP servers follow strict security best practices:

- **Credential isolation**:  Each user's credentials are stored securely and isolated from other users
- **No credential exposure**:  Credentials are never exposed to AI models or your client-side code
- **Revocable access**:  Users can revoke access to their connected accounts at any time

For more information on security, see our [security documentation](/privacy-and-security/).
