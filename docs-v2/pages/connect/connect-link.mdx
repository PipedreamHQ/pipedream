# Connect Link

Connect Link provides a Pipedream-hosted link that lets you connect third-party accounts without any frontend implementation in your app.

## When to use Connect Link

If you aren't able to execute JavaScript or open an iFrame in your frontend, or you want to send users a URL to connect accounts via email or SMS, use Connect Link. That URL opens a Pipedream-hosted page that guides the user through the account connection flow. The URL is scoped to the specific end user, and expires after 4 hours.

## How to generate a link

See [the Connect quickstart](/connect/quickstart) for a full tutorial for getting Connect up and running. 

Here's a quick overview of how to generate a Connect Link URL:

1. First, [generate a token](/connect/quickstart/#generate-a-token) for your users.
2. Extract the `connect_link_url` from the token response.
3. Before returning the URL to your user, add an `app` parameter to the end of the query string:

```
https://pipedream.com/_static/connect.html?token={token}&connectLink=true&app={appSlug}
```

4. Redirect your users to this URL, or send it to them via email, SMS, and more.

## Success and error redirect URLs

When you [generate a Connect link](/connect/quickstart/#how-to-generate-a-link), you can specify `success_redirect_url` and `error_redirect_url` parameters. Pipedream will redirect the end user to these URLs after they complete the connection flow, or if an error occurs. [See the API docs](/connect/api#create-a-new-token) for details.

In the absence of these URLs, Pipedream will redirect the user to a Pipedream-hosted success or error page at the end of the connection flow.
