# Connect API

<Callout type="warning">
Note that both the Base URL and authentication method for the Connect REST API are different from the rest of Pipedream's REST API.
</Callout>

**Base URL for all Connect requests**
```
https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect
```

**Authentication**

You authenticate to the Connect REST API using **Basic Auth**. Send your project public key as the username and the project secret key as the password. When you make API requests, pass an
`Authorization` header of the following format:

```
Authorization: Basic base_64(public_key:secret_key)
```

Clients like `cURL` will often make this easy. For example, here's how you list all accounts on a project:

```shell
curl 'https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/accounts' -u public_key:secret_key
```

### API Reference

<Callout type="warning">
This endpoint is not currently paginated, so we'll attempt to return all connected accounts for all users within your project. We intend to add pagination soon.
</Callout>
