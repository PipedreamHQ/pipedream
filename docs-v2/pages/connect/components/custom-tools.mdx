# Using Custom Tools

You can write and publish your own components to your Pipedream workspace to use with Connect. This complements the public actions available in Pipedream's global registry.

## Overview

Custom tools are Node.js modules that you develop using the [Pipedream Components API](/components/contributing/api/) and publish to your Pipedream workspace. Once published, they become available across [all Connect APIs](/connect/api/#components), including the list, retrieve, run endpoints, etc.

<Callout type="info">
Publishing custom tools is available to Pipedream customers on the [Business plan](https://pipedream.com/pricing?plan=Enterprise).
</Callout>

## Creating custom tools

Custom tools use the same development workflow as standard Pipedream components:

1. **Write your component** using the [Pipedream Components API](/components/contributing/api/)
2. **Follow component guidelines** outlined in the [component development docs](/components/contributing/guidelines/)
3. **Use the Pipedream CLI** to publish your component with a Connect-specific flag

<Callout type="info">
Custom tools are [actions](/components/contributing/actions-quickstart/). Check out the actions quickstart guide for step-by-step development instructions. Support for custom sources (triggers) is coming soon.
</Callout>

## Publishing for Connect

To make your custom components available in Connect, use the [`pd publish`](/components/contributing/cli/reference/#pd-publish) command with the `--connect-environment` flag:


```bash
pd publish my-custom-action.mjs --connect-environment development
```

### Environments

The `--connect-environment` flag accepts two values:

- **`development`**: makes the component available to your Pipedream workspace in Connect in development
- **`production`**: makes the component available to your Pipedream workspace in Connect in production

<Callout type="warning">
Components published to `development` will only be available in the development environment, and vice versa for `production`.
</Callout>

## Using custom tools

Once published, your custom tools appear alongside public components in Connect APIs:

- **List endpoints**: Custom tools are included in component listing responses
- **Retrieve endpoints**: You can fetch details about your custom components
- **Run endpoints**: Execute your custom tools with the same API calls used for public components

### Referencing custom tools

Custom tools are identified with a `~/` prefix in their component ID. For example, if you publish a component with the key `google_sheets-update-file`, it will appear in Connect APIs as `~/google_sheets-update-file`.

When making API calls to list, retrieve, or run custom tools, use the prefixed ID:

```bash
# List all components (includes custom tools with ~/ prefix)
GET /v1/components

# Retrieve a specific custom tool
GET /v1/components/~/google_sheets-update-file

# Run a custom tool
POST /v1/components/~/google_sheets-update-file/run
```

The Connect API treats custom tools identically to public components, ensuring a consistent integration experience.

### Custom tools in MCP

Custom actions that you publish are automatically exposed as tools in the [Pipedream MCP server](/connect/mcp/developer-tools) for the relevant app.

## Example workflow

Here's a typical workflow for creating and using a custom tool:

1. **Develop locally** using your preferred editor
2. **Test your component** using local testing for actions  
3. **Publish to Connect** with the appropriate environment flag
4. **Integrate via Connect APIs** in your application

<Callout type="info">
Test your custom tools in your application directly or [run Pipedream's SDK playground](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream-connect-examples/tree/master/connect-react-demo#pipedream-components-demo-react) locally with your Pipedream credentials.
</Callout>

## Best practices

- **Follow naming conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names for your tools
- **Include proper documentation**: Add helpful descriptions and prop labels for easier configuration
- **Test thoroughly**: Validate your components work as expected before publishing to production
- **Version management**: Update [component versions](/components/contributing/guidelines/#versioning) when making changes
- **Environment separation**: Use development environment for testing, production for live integrations
