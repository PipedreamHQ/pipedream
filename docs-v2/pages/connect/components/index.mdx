# Pre-built tools for your app or agent

Pipedream Connect provides APIs to embed pre-built tools ([triggers and actions](/components/contributing/)) directly in your application
or AI agent, enabling access to 10,000+ built-in API operations. Enable [your end users](/connect/api/#external-users) to
configure, deploy, and invoke Pipedream triggers and actions for more than {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS} APIs.

## What are triggers and actions?

In Pipedream, we call triggers and actions [components](/components/contributing/), which are self-contained executable units of code. Your end users configure the inputs and these components produce a
result that's exported as output. These components are developed and maintained by Pipedream
and our community and their source code is available in our [public Github repo](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/components).

## Implementation

<Callout type="info">
Check out the [SDK playground](https://pipedream.com/connect/demo) to see the SDK in action. You can also [run it locally and explore the code](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream-connect-examples/tree/master/connect-react-demo).
</Callout>

### Use Pipedream's server SDK with your own frontend
- See below to get started with Pipedream's server SDK or REST API
- Refer to the [full API reference](/connect/api/#components) for additional info

### Use Pipedream's frontend React SDK
- Pipedream provides a frontend React SDK to enable your users to configure and run triggers and actions in your app's UI
- Style the UI components however you want to match the design of your app, and you can also fork the SDK
- Refer to the [SDK](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/blob/master/packages/connect-react/README.md) to get started

## Getting started

<Callout type="info">
Refer to the [Connect API docs](/connect/api/) for the full API reference. Below is a quickstart with a few specific examples.

You can skip steps 1 and 2 if you already know the component you want to use or if you'd prefer to [pass a natural language prompt to Pipedream's component search API](/rest-api/#search-for-registry-components).
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Authenticate to the Pipedream API

Before sending requests to the API, make sure to [authenticate using a Pipedream OAuth client](/rest-api/auth/#oauth):

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'HTTP (cURL)']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
// Initialize the Pipedream SDK client

import { createBackendClient } from "@pipedream/sdk/server";

const pd = createBackendClient({
  environment: "development | production",
  credentials: {
    clientId: "{oauth_client_id}",
    clientSecret: "{oauth_client_secret}",
  },
  projectId: "{your_project_id}"
});
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
# Get an access token for the REST API

curl -X POST https://api.pipedream.com/v1/oauth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "client_id": "{your_oauth_client_id}",
    "client_secret": "{your_oauth_client_secret}"
  }'
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
All subsequent examples assume that you've either initialized the SDK client or have a valid access token.
</Callout>

### Find the app you want to use

To find the right trigger or action to configure and run, first find the app. In this example, we'll search for `gitlab`.

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'HTTP (cURL)']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
const apps = await pd.getApps({ q: "gitlab" });

// Parse and return the data you need
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
curl -X https://api.pipedream.com/v1/apps?q=gitlab \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"

# Parse and return the data you need
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Here's the response:

```json
{
  "page_info": {
    "total_count": 1,
    "count": 1,
    "start_cursor": "Z2l0bGFi",
    "end_cursor": "Z2l0bGFi"
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "app_1Z2hw1",
      "name_slug": "gitlab",
      "name": "GitLab",
      "auth_type": "oauth",
      "description": "GitLab is the most comprehensive AI-powered DevSecOps Platform.",
      "img_src": "https://assets.pipedream.net/s.v0/app_1Z2hw1/logo/orig",
      "custom_fields_json": "[{\"name\":\"base_api_url\",\"label\":\"Base API URL\",\"description\":\"The Base API URL defaults to `gitlab.com`. If you are using self-hosted Gitlab, enter your base url here, e.g. `gitlab.example.com`\",\"default\":\"gitlab.com\",\"optional\":null}]",
      "categories": [
        "Developer Tools"
      ],
      "featured_weight": 5000,
      "connect": {
        "proxy_enabled": true,
        "allowed_domains": ["gitlab.com"],
        "base_proxy_target_url": "https://{{custom_fields.base_api_url}}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### List the available components for the app

Once you have the app you want to use, now you can list the triggers and/or actions for that app. We'll list the actions for Gitlab and we'll pass the `name_slug` `gitlab` as the `app`.

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'HTTP (cURL)']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
const components = await pd.getComponents({ q: "gitlab" });

// Parse and return the data you need
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
curl -X https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/{project_id}/actions?app=gitlab \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-PD-Environment: {environment}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"

# Parse and return the data you need
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Here's the response:

```json
{
  "page_info": {
    "total_count": 20,
    "count": 10,
    "start_cursor": "c2NfbHlpRThkQQ",
    "end_cursor": "c2NfQjVpTkJBTA"
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "List Commits",
      "version": "0.0.2",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-list-commits"
    },
    {
      "name": "Update Issue",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-update-issue"
    },
    {
      "name": "Update Epic",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-update-epic"
    },
    {
      "name": "Search Issues",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-search-issues"
    },
    {
      "name": "List Repo Branches",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-list-repo-branches"
    },
    {
      "name": "Get Repo Branch",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-get-repo-branch"
    },
    {
      "name": "Get Issue",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-get-issue"
    },
    {
      "name": "Create issue",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-create-issue"
    },
    {
      "name": "Create Epic",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-create-epic"
    },
    {
      "name": "Create Branch",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "key": "gitlab_developer_app-create-branch"
    }
  ]
}
```
### Retrieve the component's definition

To configure and run a component for your end users, you need to understand
the component's definition. Now that you have the component's key from the previous step,
you can retrieve its structure from the Pipedream API. See the [component
structure](/components/contributing/api/#component-structure) section in our docs for more
details.

As an example, the following API call will return the structure of the **List
Commits** action for Gitlab:

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'HTTP (cURL)']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
const component = await pd.getComponent({ key: "gitlab-list-commits" });

// Parse and return the data you need
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
curl -X https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/{project_id}/components/gitlab-list-commits \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-PD-Environment: {environment}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"

# Parse and return the data you need
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

The response will contain the component's structure, including its user-friendly name,
version, and most importantly, the configuration options the component accepts
(also known as [props](/components/contributing/api/#props) or "properties").
Here's an example of the response for the component in the example above:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "List Commits",
    "version": "0.0.3",
    "key": "gitlab-list-commits",
    "configurable_props": [
      {
        "name": "gitlab",
        "type": "app",
        "app": "gitlab"
      },
      {
        "name": "projectId",
        "type": "integer",
        "label": "Project ID",
        "description": "The project ID, as displayed in the main project page",
        "remoteOptions": true
      },
      {
        "name": "refName",
        "type": "string",
        "label": "Branch Name",
        "description": "The name of the branch",
        "remoteOptions": true,
        "optional": true
      },
      {
        "name": "max",
        "type": "integer",
        "label": "Max Results",
        "description": "Max number of results to return. Default value is `100`",
        "optional": true,
        "default": 100
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Using this information, you can now drive the configuration of the component for
your end users, as described in the next section.

### Configure the component

Component execution on behalf of your end users requires a few preliminary
steps, focused on getting the right input parameters (aka
[props](/workflows/building-workflows/using-props/)) to the component.

Configuring each prop for a component often involves an API call to retrieve the possible values,
unless the values that a prop can take are static or free-form. The endpoint is accessible at:

```
POST /v1/connect/{project_id}/components/configure
```

Typically, the options for a prop are linked to a specific user's account. Each
of these props implements an `options` method that retrieves the necessary
options from the third-party API, formats them, and sends them back in the
response for the end user to select. Examples are listing Slack channels, Google Sheets, etc.

The payload for the configuration API call must contain the following fields:

1. `external_user_id`: the ID of your user on your end
2. `id`: the component's unique ID (aka **key**)
3. `prop_name`: the name of the prop you want to configure
4. `configured_props`: an object containing the props that have already been
    configured. The initial configuration call must contain the ID of the account
    (aka `authProvisionId`) that your user has connected to the target app (see
    [this section](/connect/managed-auth/quickstart) for
    more details on how to create these accounts).

We'll use the [**List Commits** component for
Gitlab](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/blob/master/components/gitlab/actions/list-commits/list-commits.mjs#L4)
as an example, to illustrate a call that retrieves the options for the
`projectId` prop of that component:

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'HTTP (cURL)']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
const { options } = await pd.configureComponent({
  externalUserId: "abc-123",
  componentId: "gitlab-list-commits",
  propName: "projectId",
  configuredProps: {
    gitlab: {
      authProvisionId: "apn_kVh9AoD",
    }
  }
});

// Parse and return the data you need
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/{project_id}/components/configure \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-PD-Environment: {environment}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -d '{
    "external_user_id": "abc-123",
    "id": "gitlab-list-commits",
    "prop_name": "projectId",
    "configured_props": {
      "gitlab": {
        "authProvisionId": "apn_kVh9AoD"
      }
    }
  }'
# Parse and return the data you need
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>


The response contains the possible values (and their human-readable labels
when applicable) for the prop, as well as any possible errors that might have
occurred. The response for the request above would look like this:

```json
{
  "observations": [],
  "context": null,
  "options": [
    {
      "label": "jverce/foo-massive-10231-1",
      "value": 45672541
    },
    {
      "label": "jverce/foo-massive-10231",
      "value": 45672514
    },
    {
      "label": "jverce/foo-massive-14999-2",
      "value": 45672407
    },
    {
      "label": "jverce/foo-massive-14999-1",
      "value": 45672382
    },
    {
      "label": "jverce/foo-massive-14999",
      "value": 45672215
    },
    {
      "label": "jverce/gitlab-development-kit",
      "value": 21220953
    },
    {
      "label": "jverce/gitlab",
      "value": 21208123
    }
  ],
  "errors": [],
  "timings": {
    "api_to_sidekiq": 1734043172355.1042,
    "sidekiq_received": 1734043172357.867,
    "sidekiq_to_lambda": 1734043172363.6812,
    "sidekiq_done": 1734043173461.6406,
    "lambda_configure_prop_called": 1734043172462,
    "lambda_done": 1734043173455
  },
  "stringOptions": null
}
```

<Callout type="info">

Fields inside `configured_props` are written in camel case since they refer to
the names of props as they appear in the component's code, they are not
attributes that the API itself consumes.

</Callout>

You configure props one-by-one, making a call to the component configuration API
for each new prop. Subsequent prop configuration calls will be identical to the
one above:

1. Add the prop you currently want to configure as the `prop_name`
2. Include the names and values of all previously-configured props in the
   `configured_props` object. Keep this object in your app's local state, add a
   prop once you or the end user selects a value, and pass it to the
   `configured_props` API param.

For example, to retrieve the configuration options for the `refName` prop:

```json
{
  "async_handle": "IyvFeE5oNpYd",
  "external_user_id": "demo-34c13d13-a31e-4a3d-8b63-0ac954671095",
  "id": "gitlab-list-commits",
  "prop_name": "refName",
  "configured_props": {
    "gitlab": {
      "authProvisionId": "apn_oOhaBlD"
    },
    "projectId": 21208123
  }
}
```

### Configure dynamic props

The set of props that a component can accept might not be static, and may change
depending on the values of prior props. Props that behave this way are called
[dynamic props](/components/contributing/api/#dynamic-props), and they need to be configured
in a different way. Props that are dynamic will have a `reloadProps` attribute
set to `true` in the component's definition.

After configuring a dynamic prop, the set of subsequent props must be recomputed
(or reloaded), which is possible using the following API call:

```text
POST /v1/connect/components/props
```

The payload is similar to the one used for the configuration API, but it
excludes the `prop_name` field since the goal of this call is to reload and
retrieve the new set of props, not to configure a specific one.

Using the [Add Single Row action for Google Sheets](https://pipedream.com/apps/google-sheets/actions/add-single-row) as an example, the
request payload would look like this:

```json
{
  "async_handle": "PL41Yf3PuX61",
  "external_user_id": "demo-25092fa8-86c0-4d46-86c9-9dc9bde3b964",
  "id": "google_sheets-add-single-row",
  "configured_props": {
    "googleSheets": {
      "authProvisionId": "apn_V1hMoE7"
    },
    "sheetId": "1BfWjFF2dTW_YDiLISj5N9nKCUErShgugPS434liyytg"
  }
}
```

In this case, the `sheetId` prop is dynamic, and so after configuring it, the
set of props must be reloaded. The response will contain the new set of props
and their definition, similar to when the [component information was first
retrieved](#retrieving-a-components-definition). The response will also contain
an ID that can be used to reference the new set of props in subsequent
configuration calls. If this is ID is not provided, the set of props will be
based on the definition of the component that was retrieved initially.

To illustrate, the response for the request above would look like this:

```json
{
  "observations": [],
  "errors": [],
  "dynamicProps": {
    "id": "dyp_6xUyVgQ",
    "configurableProps": [
      {
        "name": "googleSheets",
        "type": "app",
        "app": "google_sheets"
      },
      {
        "name": "drive",
        "type": "string",
        "label": "Drive",
        "description": "Defaults to `My Drive`. To select a [Shared Drive](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310351) instead, select it from this list.",
        "optional": true,
        "default": "My Drive",
        "remoteOptions": true
      },
      {
        "name": "sheetId",
        "type": "string",
        "label": "Spreadsheet",
        "description": "The Spreadsheet ID",
        "useQuery": true,
        "remoteOptions": true,
        "reloadProps": true
      },
      {
        "name": "worksheetId",
        "type": "string[]",
        "label": "Worksheet(s)",
        "description": "Select a worksheet or enter a custom expression. When referencing a spreadsheet dynamically, you must provide a custom expression for the worksheet.",
        "remoteOptions": true,
        "reloadProps": true
      },
      {
        "name": "hasHeaders",
        "type": "boolean",
        "label": "Does the first row of the sheet have headers?",
        "description": "If the first row of your document has headers, we'll retrieve them to make it easy to enter the value for each column. Note: When using a dynamic reference for the worksheet ID (e.g. `{{steps.foo.$return_value}}`), this setting is ignored.",
        "reloadProps": true
      },
      {
        "name": "myColumnData",
        "type": "string[]",
        "label": "Values",
        "description": "Provide a value for each cell of the row. Google Sheets accepts strings, numbers and boolean values for each cell. To set a cell to an empty value, pass an empty string."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Execution

Once all the props have been configured, the component can be invoked. Pipedream
supports two types of components: [actions](/components/contributing/api/#actions) and
[sources](/components/contributing/api/#sources) (aka triggers).

Actions are components that perform a task by taking an input either during
[configuration](#configure-the-component) and/or during invocation (usually both), and
produces a result. Sources are very similar, but the difference is that they are
not invoked directly by end users directly, but rather by events that happen on a
third-party service. For example, the "New File" source for Google Drive will be
triggered every time a new file is created in a specific folder in Google Drive,
then will emit an event for you to consume.

All this means is that actions can be invoked manually on demand, while sources
are instead deployed and run automatically when the event they are listening for
occurs.

#### Invoking an action

At the end of the configuration process for an action, you'll end up with a
payload that you can use to invoke the action. The payload is similar to the one
used for configuring a prop, with the exception of the `prop_name` attribute
(because we're not configuring any props at this point):

```json
{
  "async_handle": "xFfBakdTGTkI",
  "external_user_id": "abc-123",
  "id": "gitlab-list-commits",
  "configured_props": {
    "gitlab": {
      "authProvisionId": "apn_kVh9AoD"
    },
    "projectId": 45672541,
    "refName": "main"
  }
}
```

To run the action with this configuration, simply send it as the request payload
to the following endpoint:

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'HTTP (cURL)']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
const resp = await pd.runAction({
  externalUserId: "abc-123",
  actionId: "gitlab-list-commits",
  configuredProps: {
    gitlab: {
      authProvisionId: "apn_kVh9AoD",
    },
    projectId: 45672541,
    refName: "main"
  }
});

// Parse and return the data you need
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/{project_id}/actions/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-PD-Environment: {environment}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -d '{
    "external_user_id": "abc-123",
    "id": "gitlab-list-commits",
    "configured_props": {
      "gitlab": {
        "authProvisionId": "apn_kVh9AoD"
      },
      "projectId": 45672541,
    }
  }'

# Parse and return the data you need
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

The output of executing the action will be a JSON object containing the
following fields:

1. `exports`: all the named exports produced by the action, like when calling
   [`$.export` in a Node.js](/workflows/building-workflows/code/nodejs/#using-export) component.
2. `os`: a list of observations produced by the action (e.g. logs, errors, etc).
3. `ret`: the return value of the action, if any.
4. When using [File Stash](/connect/components/files) to sync local files, the response will also include a `stash` property with file information.

The following (abbreviated) example shows the output of running the action
above:

```json
{
  "exports": {
    "$summary": "Retrieved 1 commit"
  },
  "os": [],
  "ret": [
    {
      "id": "387262aea5d4a6920ac76c1e202bc9fd0841fea5",
      "short_id": "387262ae",
      "created_at": "2023-05-03T03:03:25.000+00:00",
      "parent_ids": [],
      "title": "Initial commit",
      "message": "Initial commit",
      "author_name": "Jay Vercellone",
      "author_email": "nope@pipedream.com",
      "authored_date": "2023-05-03T03:03:25.000+00:00",

#### Deploying a source

Because sources are exercised by events that happen on a third-party service,
their semantics are different from actions. Once a source is configured, it must
be deployed to start listening for events. When deploying a source, you
can define either a webhook URL or a Pipedream workflow ID to consume those events.

Deploying a source is done by sending a payload similar to the one used for
running an action, with the addition of the webhook URL or workflow ID. Using
the **New Issue (Instant)** source for Gitlab as an example, the payload would
look something like this:

```json
{
  "external_user_id": "abc-123",
  "id": "gitlab-new-issue",
  "prop_name": "http",
  "configured_props": {
    "gitlab": {
      "authProvisionId": "apn_kVh9AoD"
    },
    "projectId": 45672541
  },
  "webhook_url": "https://events.example.com/gitlab-new-issue"
}
```

Deploy a source for your users:

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'HTTP (cURL)']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
const { data: deployedTrigger } = await pd.deployTrigger({
  externalUserId: "abc-123",
  triggerId: "gitlab-new-issue",
  configuredProps: {
    gitlab: {
      authProvisionId: "apn_kVh9AoD",
    },
    projectId: 45672541,
  },
  webhookUrl: "https://events.example.com/gitlab-new-issue"
});

const {
  id: triggerId,      // The unique ID of the deployed trigger
  name: triggerName,  // The name of the deployed trigger
  owner_id: userId,   // The unique ID in Pipedream of your user
} = deployedTrigger;

// Parse and return the data you need
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/{project_id}/components/triggers/deploy \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-PD-Environment: {environment}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -d '{
    "external_user_id": "abc-123",
    "id": "gitlab-new-issue",
    "configured_props": {
      "gitlab": {
        "authProvisionId": "apn_kVh9AoD"
      },
      "projectId": 45672541,
    },
    "webhook_url": "https://events.example.com/gitlab-new-issue"
  }'
# Parse and return the data you need
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

If the source deployment succeeds, the response will contain the information
regarding the state of the source, including all the component's props metadata,
as well as their values. It will also contain its name, creation date, owner,
and most importantly its unique ID, which can be used to manage the source in
the future (e.g. delete it). The response for the request above would look like
this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "dc_dAuGmW7",
    "owner_id": "exu_oedidz",
    "component_id": "sc_3vijzQr",
    "configurable_props": [
      {
        "name": "gitlab",
        "type": "app",
        "app": "gitlab"
      },
      {
        "name": "db",
        "type": "$.service.db"
      },
      {
        "name": "http",
        "type": "$.interface.http",
        "customResponse": true
      },
      {
        "name": "projectId",
        "type": "integer",
        "label": "Project ID",
        "description": "The project ID, as displayed in the main project page",
        "remoteOptions": true
      }
    ],
    "configured_props": {
      "gitlab": {
        "authProvisionId": "apn_kVh9AoD"
      },
      "db": {
        "type": "$.service.db"
      },
      "http": {
        "endpoint_url": "https://xxxxxxxxxx.m.pipedream.net"
      },
      "projectId": 45672541
    },
    "active": true,
    "created_at": 1734028283,
    "updated_at": 1734028283,
    "name": "My first project - exu_oedidz",
    "name_slug": "my-first-project---exu-oedidz-2"
  }
}
```

In the example above, the source ID is `dc_dAuGmW7`, which can be used to delete,
retrieve, or update the source in the future.

Refer to the [full Connect API reference](/connect/api#components) for questions and additional examples.

</Steps>

## Deploying triggers

These are 2 categories of triggers you can deploy on behalf of your end users:
- [App-based event sources](#app-based-event-sources)
- [Native triggers](#native-triggers)

<Callout type="info">
Refer to the [full Connect API reference](/connect/api/#deploy-trigger) to list, retrieve, delete, and manage triggers for your user.
</Callout>

### App-based event sources
- Listen for events that occur in other systems: for example, when [a new file is added to Google Drive](https://pipedream.com/apps/google-drive/triggers/new-files-instant) or when [a new contact is created in HubSpot](https://pipedream.com/apps/hubspot/triggers/new-or-updated-contact)
- Deploying these triggers requires that your customers first connect their account using [Pipedream Connect Managed Auth](/connect/managed-auth/quickstart), since the triggers are deployed on their behalf using account
- Refer to the [quickstart above](#deploying-a-source) to get started 

#### Handling test events
- Many event sources attempt to retrieve a small set of historical events on deploy to provide visibility into the event shape for end users and developers
- Exposing real test events make it easier to consume the event in downstream systems without requiring users to trigger real events ([more info](/components/contributing/guidelines/#surfacing-test-events))
- However, this results in emitting those events to the listening webhook immediately, which may not always be ideal, depending on your use case
- If you'd like to avoid emitting historical events, you can deploy a trigger without defining a `webhook_url`, then [update the listening webhooks for the deployed trigger](/connect/api/#update-webhooks-listening-to-deployed-trigger) after roughly a minute


### Native triggers
- You can also deploy native triggers, which don't require any authentication from your end users, so **you should skip the account connection process when configuring these triggers**
- Because these triggers don't use a connected account from your end users, APIs to deploy and manage them are slightly different (see below)

#### HTTP Webhook
Generate a unique HTTP webhook URL for your end users to configure in any other upstream service.

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'HTTP (cURL)']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
const { data: deployedTrigger } = await pd.deployTrigger({
  externalUserId: "abc-123",
  triggerId: "http-new-requests",
  webhookUrl: "https://events.example.com/http-new-requests"
});

const {
  id: triggerId,              // The unique ID of the deployed trigger
  endpoint_url: endpointUrl,  // The endpoint URL to return to the user
} = deployedTrigger;

// Parse and return the data you need
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/{project_id}/components/triggers/deploy \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-PD-Environment: {environment}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -d '{
    "external_user_id": "abc-123",
    "id": "http-new-requests",
    "webhook_url": "https://events.example.com/http-new-requests"
  }'

# Parse and return the data you need
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

##### Example response

```json
{
  "id": "hi_zbGHMx",
  "key": "xxxxxxxxxx",
  "endpoint_url": "http://xxxxxxxxxx.m.pipedream.net",
  "custom_response": true,
  "created_at": 1744508049,
  "updated_at": 1744508049
}
```

#### Schedule
Deploy a timer to act as a cron job that will emit an event on a custom schedule you or your users define.

##### Configured props

`cron` (**object**)

When defining schedules, you can pass one of the following:
- `intervalSeconds`: Define the frequency in seconds
- `cron`: Define a custom cron schedule and optionally define the `timezone`. For example:

```json
"cron": {
  "cron": "0 * * * *",
  "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles" // optional, defaults to UTC
}
```

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'HTTP (cURL)']}>

    }
  },
  webhookUrl: "https://events.example.com/schedule-custom-interval"

#### New emails received 
Generate a unique email address for your customers to emit events to

}
```

## Special Prop Types

### SQL Prop

The `sql` prop is a specialized prop type used for interacting with SQL databases. It enables developers to build applications that can:

- Execute custom SQL queries
- Introspect database schemas
- Support prepared statements

This prop type is used by these database actions:

- `postgresql-execute-custom-query`
- `snowflake-execute-sql-query`
- `mysql-execute-raw-query`
- `microsoft_sql_server-execute-raw-query`
- `azure_sql-execute-raw-query`
- `turso-execute-query`

#### Configuration

When configuring these actions, you'll need to provide:

1. Database app type and auth (e.g., `postgresql` in this example)
2. A `sql` prop with the following structure:

```javascript
const configuredProps = {
  postgresql: {
    authProvisionId: "apn_xxxxxxx"
  },
  sql: {
    auth: {
      app: "postgresql"  // Database type -- must match the app prop name 
    },
    query: "select * from products limit 1",
    params: []  // Optional array of parameters for prepared statements
  }
}
```

#### Using prepared statements

You can use prepared statements by including placeholders in your query and providing the parameter values in the `params` array. Different database systems use different placeholder syntax:

- **PostgreSQL** uses `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc. for numbered parameters
- **Snowflake**, **MySQL, Azure SQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Turso** use `?` for positional parameters

<Tabs items={['PostgreSQL example', 'MySQL example']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
const configuredProps = {
  postgresql: {
    authProvisionId: "apn_xxxxxxx"
  },
  sql: {
    auth: {
      app: "postgresql" 
    },
    query: "select * from products where name = $1 and price > $2 limit 1",
    params: ["foo", 10.99]  // Values to replace $1 and $2 placeholders
  }
}
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
const configuredProps = {
  mysql: {
    authProvisionId: "apn_xxxxxxx"
  },
  sql: {
    auth: {
      app: "mysql" 
    },
    query: "select * from products where name = ? and price > ? limit 1",
    params: ["foo", 10.99]  // Values to replace the ? placeholders
  }
}
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>


<Callout type="info">
Using prepared statements helps prevent SQL injection attacks by separating the SQL command structure from the data values being used, and is strongly recommended.
</Callout>

#### Retrieving database schema information

By retrieving the database schema, developers can:

- Provide database structure to AI agents for accurate SQL generation
- Build native SQL editors with autocomplete for tables and columns
- Validate queries against the actual database schema before execution

You can call `configureComponent` on the `sql` prop to retrieve database schema information:

```javascript
const resp = await pd.configureComponent({
  externalUserId: externalUserId,
  propName: "sql",
  componentId: "postgresql-execute-custom-query",
  configuredProps: {
    postgresql: {
      authProvisionId: accountId
    },
  },
});
```

The response includes a `context.dbInfo` object containing detailed schema information for all tables in the database:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "dbInfo": {
      "products": {
        "metadata": {},
        "schema": {
          "id": {
            "tableName": "products",
            "columnName": "id",
            "isNullable": "NO",
            "dataType": "integer",
            "columnDefault": "nextval('products_id_seq'::regclass)"
          },
          "name": {
            "tableName": "products",
            "columnName": "name",
            "isNullable": "NO",
            "dataType": "character varying",
            "columnDefault": null
          },
          "description": {
            "tableName": "products",
            "columnName": "description",
            "isNullable": "YES",
            "dataType": "text",
            "columnDefault": null
          },
          "price": {
            "tableName": "products",
            "columnName": "price",
            "isNullable": "NO",
            "dataType": "numeric",
            "columnDefault": null
          },
          "created_at": {
            "tableName": "products",
            "columnName": "created_at",
            "isNullable": "YES",
            "dataType": "timestamp with time zone",
            "columnDefault": "CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Referencing the app prop in configured props payload

If you encounter an error like `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'oauth_access_token')`, it's likely related to an incorrect reference to the app prop in your configured_props payload.

For example, using `google_sheets` instead of `googleSheets`, or `stripe` instead of `app`. Always use the exact app prop name as returned by the component definition.

The app prop name can be found in the component's definition under `configurable_props`:

```json
"configurable_props": [
  {
    "name": "googleSheets", // Use this exact name in your payload
    "type": "app",
    "app": "google_sheets"
  },
  ...
]
```

### Passing dynamic props ID

When working with components that use dynamic props, you must track and pass the `dynamicPropsId` in your API calls. After calling the API to reload props as described in the [Configure dynamic props](#configure-dynamic-props) section, you'll receive a response containing a `dynamicProps.id` value that looks like `dyp_6xUyVgQ`.

This ID must be included in subsequent API calls to `runAction` or `deployTrigger`. Failing to include it can result in errors like:

```json
{
  "name": "Error",
  "message": "undefined is not an array or an array-like"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "title": "TypeError",
  "detail": "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'endpoint')"
}
```

For example, after receiving the dynamic props ID from the reload props call, include it in your action execution:

```javascript
// First, reload props for a component with dynamic props
const { dynamicProps } = await pd.reloadProps({ … });

// Then use the dynamicProps.id when running the action
const resp = await pd.runAction({
  externalUserId: "abc-123",
  actionId: "google_sheets-add-single-row",
  dynamicPropsId: dynamicProps.id, // Must include this
  configuredProps: {
    googleSheets: {
      authProvisionId: account.id,
    },
    sheetId: "1BfWjFF2dTW_YDiLISj5N9nKCUErShgugPS434liyytg",
    worksheetId: "Sheet1",
    // ... other configured props
  }
});
```

Remember to maintain this ID in your application state while the user is configuring the component, and include it in all subsequent API calls related to that particular configuration.

### Checking source logs for deployed triggers

If a deployed trigger isn't emitting events as expected, you can examine the source logs to get a better sense of what's happening. 

Use the following URL to access logs and view emitted events:

```
https://pipedream.com/sources/{dcid}
```

Replace `{dcid}` with your deployed component ID (e.g., `dc_dAuGmW7`).

The sources UI contains three tabs:

- **Events**: Lists emitted events from the deployed trigger that will be sent to the subscribed webhook or workflow. This helps you verify that events are being properly processed and understand their structure.

- **Logs**: Displays execution history for the trigger. For polling sources, this shows each time the trigger checks for updates. For webhook-based instant sources, it shows each time the source receives an event from the upstream API. This tab is especially useful for troubleshooting when events aren't being emitted as expected.

- **Configuration**: Provides a read-only view of the deployed source's code and configuration. While you can't modify settings for deployed triggers that belong to external users here, this tab offers insight into how the trigger is configured.

<Callout type="info">
This UI view is currently in beta and has some limitations. Some UI elements may appear unpolished, and the configuration tab has limited functionality.
