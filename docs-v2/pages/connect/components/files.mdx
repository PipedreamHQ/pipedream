# Working with Files

Pipedream provides a file storage system that allows you to store and retrieve files from tool executions via Connect. When a trigger or action downloads files to the `/tmp` directory in Pipedream's execution environment, you can sync these files with a Pipedream File Store, making them accessible outside of Pipedream.

## File Stash

When you execute an action via Connect that downloads files to the `/tmp` directory, those files normally only exist within Pipedream's execution environment. With File Stash syncing, you can now make these files available via presigned URLs that can be accessed from anywhere.

### How it works

1. Files created in `/tmp` during execution are synced with a Pipedream File Store when you pass `stashId` in the action execution payload
2. Each file is assigned a presigned URL that remains valid for 30 minutes
3. These URLs allow anyone with the link to download the file directly

## When to use stashId

You should pass the `stashId` parameter when:

1. You're working with actions that download or generate files in `/tmp`, such as actions with "file", "upload", or "download" in their name
2. You're working with actions that have a `filePath` or `filename` prop
3. You want to make files accessible outside of Pipedream's execution environment

To generate a new stash ID, you can pass:
- An empty string (`""`)
- The string `"NEW"`
- Boolean `true`

To reuse an existing stash ID (valid for 24 hours), pass the previously returned `stashId` value. This allows you to reference multiple files from the same stash.

<Callout type="info">
Avoid passing `stashId` unnecessarily as it will slightly increase response time.
</Callout>

## API Reference

### Running actions with File Stash

To enable File Stash when running an action, use the `stash_id` parameter in your request:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stash_id` | string | (Optional) The key that identifies the external user-specific File Stash. If set to `""` (or `"NEW"` or `true`), Pipedream will generate a stash ID for you. If omitted, Pipedream will not sync files in `/tmp` with File Stash. |

    "$filestash_uploads": [

```

Each file in the `$filestash_uploads` array includes:

- `localPath`: The path to the file in the `/tmp` directory
- `s3Key`: The unique key for the file in the Pipedream File Store
- `get_url`: A presigned URL that allows downloading the file for 30 minutes

## Usage Examples

### Reusing a stash ID

To add more files to an existing stash, provide the same `stash_id` in subsequent action runs:

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'HTTP (cURL)']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
// First run generates a stash ID
const firstRun = await pd.actionRun({
  externalUserId: "abc-123",
  actionId: "download-file-1",
  configuredProps: { /* ... */ },
  stashId: "NEW"
});

// Save the stash ID
const savedStashId = firstRun.stashId;

// Later, add more files to the same stash
const secondRun = await pd.actionRun({
  externalUserId: "abc-123",
  actionId: "download-file-2",
  configuredProps: { /* ... */ },
  stashId: savedStashId // Reuse the existing stash ID
});
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
# First request with new stash
curl -X POST https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/{project_id}/actions/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -d '{
    "external_user_id": "abc-123",
    "id": "download-file-1",
    "configured_props": { /* ... */ },
    "stash_id": "NEW"
  }'

# Get the stash_id from the response

# Second request using the same stash
curl -X POST https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/{project_id}/actions/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -d '{
    "external_user_id": "abc-123",
    "id": "download-file-2",
    "configured_props": { /* ... */ },
    "stash_id": "d4ffb5b1081d3aacd2929f23f270237d"
  }'
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## File Storage Duration

Files in the File Stash are automatically deleted after 24 hours. The presigned URLs remain valid for 30 minutes from the time they are generated.
