# Working with Files

Pipedream provides a file storage system, File Stash, that allows you to store and retrieve files from tool executions via Connect. When a trigger or action downloads files to the `/tmp` directory in Pipedream's execution environment, you can sync these files with File Stash, making them accessible outside of Pipedream.

## File Stash

When you execute an action via Connect that downloads files to the `/tmp` directory, those files normally only exist within Pipedream's execution environment. With File Stash syncing, you can now make these files available via presigned URLs that can be accessed from anywhere.

### How it works

1. Files created in `/tmp` during execution are synced with File Stash when you pass `stashId` in the action execution payload
2. Each file is assigned a presigned URL that remains valid for 30 minutes
3. These URLs allow anyone with the link to download the file directly

## When to use stashId

You should pass the `stashId` parameter when:

1. You're working with actions that download or generate files in `/tmp`, such as actions with "file", "upload", or "download" in their name
2. You're working with actions that have a `filePath` or `filename` prop
3. You want to make files accessible outside of Pipedream's execution environment

To generate a new stash ID, you can pass:
- An empty string (`""`)
- The string `"NEW"`
- Boolean `true`

To reuse an existing stash ID (valid for 24 hours), pass the previously returned `stashId` value. This allows you to reference multiple files from the same stash.

<Callout type="info">
Avoid passing `stashId` unnecessarily as it will slightly increase response time.
</Callout>

## API Reference

### Running actions with File Stash

To enable File Stash when running an action, use the `stash_id` parameter in your request:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stash_id` | string | (Optional) The key that identifies the external user-specific File Stash. If set to `""` (or `"NEW"` or `true`), Pipedream will generate a stash ID for you. If omitted, Pipedream will not sync files in `/tmp` with File Stash. |

}
```

Each file in the `$filestash_uploads` array includes:

- `localPath`: The path to the file in the `/tmp` directory where it was downloaded or created
- `s3Key`: The unique key for the file in the Pipedream File Stash after being synced from `/tmp`
- `get_url`: A presigned URL that allows downloading the file for 30 minutes

## Usage Examples

### Reusing a stash ID

You can reuse a stash ID across multiple action runs to maintain a reference to previously downloaded files. This is particularly useful when you need to:

- Process multiple files across different actions in a sequence
- Keep a reference to files for later use in your app or agent
- Build a collection of files over time
- Ensure files downloaded in one action are accessible in subsequent actions

To reuse a stash ID, simply pass the same `stashId` value to subsequent action runs:

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'HTTP (cURL)']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```javascript
// First action run - download a file from Google Drive
const firstResponse = await pd.actionRun({
  externalUserId: "abc-123",
  actionId: "google_drive-download-file",
  configuredProps: {
    googleDrive: {
      authProvisionId: "apn_gyhLaz3"
    },
    fileId: "1xyz123",
    filePath: "/tmp/report1.pdf"
  },
  stashId: "" // Generate a new stash ID
});

const stashId = firstResponse.stashId;

// Second action run - use the same file in another action (e.g., upload to Dropbox)
const secondResponse = await pd.actionRun({
  externalUserId: "abc-123", 
  actionId: "dropbox-upload-file",
  configuredProps: {
    dropbox: {
      authProvisionId: "apn_mmhHPgj"
    },
    path: "/",
    name: "uploaded-report.pdf",
    filePath: "/tmp/report1.pdf" // Same file path as in the first action
  },
  stashId: stashId // Reuse the stash ID to maintain access to the file
});

// The file downloaded in the first action is available to the second action
```

<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
# First request with new stash
curl -X POST https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/{project_id}/actions/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \

      },
      "fileId": "1W6ZssXLvVE-YN8rRbQlqggCpdIF-gdh1",
      "filePath": "/tmp/myfile.txt"
    },
    "stash_id": "NEW"
  }'

# Get the stash_id from the response (e.g., "abcd1234")

# Second request using the same stash
curl -X POST https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/{project_id}/actions/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -d '{
    "external_user_id": "abc-123",
    "id": "dropbox-upload-file",
    "configured_props": {
      "dropbox": {
        "authProvisionId": "apn_mmhHPgj"
      },
      "path": "/",
      "name": "my-upload.txt",
      "filePath": "/tmp/myfile.txt"
    },
    "stash_id": "abcd1234"
  }'
```

### Common multi-action file workflows

A typical workflow involving files across multiple actions might look like:

1. Download a file from an external service to `/tmp`
2. Process or transform the file
3. Upload the file to another service

For this to work reliably, you need to use the same `stashId` across all actions to ensure that files downloaded or created in one action remain accessible to subsequent actions, even though each action runs in its own isolated environment.

## File Storage Duration

Files in File Stash are automatically deleted after 24 hours. The presigned URLs remain valid for 30 minutes from the time they are generated.
