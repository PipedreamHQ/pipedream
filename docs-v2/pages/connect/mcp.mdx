# MCP Servers

Pipedream offers dedicated MCP ([Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)) servers for all of our {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ integrated apps. These servers enable AI assistants like Claude to securely access and interact with thousands of APIs through a standardized communication protocol, performing real-world tasks by connecting to your accounts.

Pipedream's MCP servers are powered by [Pipedream Connect](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect), including:

- Access to {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ apps and APIs through a consistent interface
- Over 10,000 pre-built tools and actions
- Fully-managed OAuth and credential storage
- Secure account connections with revocable access

<Callout type="info">
User credentials are encrypted at rest and all requests are made through Pipedream's servers, never directly exposing credentials to AI models. Read more about how we protect user credentials [here](/privacy-and-security/#third-party-oauth-grants-api-keys-and-environment-variables).

## Available MCP servers

Pipedream provides MCP servers for all our [supported apps](https://pipedream.com/apps). Each app has its own dedicated MCP server with tools specific to that API. For example:

- **[Slack MCP server](https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/slack)**:  Send messages, manage channels, create reminders, and more
- **[GitHub MCP server](https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/github)**:  Create issues, manage pull requests, search repositories
- **[Google Sheets MCP server](https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/google-sheets)**:  Read and write data, format cells, create charts

Explore the full list of available MCP servers at [mcp.pipedream.com](https://mcp.pipedream.com).

## Getting started

You can use Pipedream's MCP servers in two ways:

1. **[As an end user](#for-end-users)**:  Connect your accounts through our hosted MCP servers at [mcp.pipedream.com](https://mcp.pipedream.com)
2. **[As a developer](#for-developers)**:  Host your own MCP servers for your application or organization

### For end users

Set up MCP servers to use with any compatible MCP client, like Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Cursor, and VS Code.

<Steps>

#### Configure MCP servers and connect accounts

- Navigate to [mcp.pipedream.com](https://mcp.pipedream.com) and sign in or create an account (this is a separate account from pipdream.com)
- Browse available MCP servers
- Follow the configuration instructions on the server page to add it to your preferred MCP client
- Connect your account (you can do this in the UI or the AI will prompt you when you first use a tool)

#### Start chatting

Ask the LLM or agent to perform tasks using your connected services. For example:

- "Send a message to my team in Slack"
- "Create a new issue in GitHub"
- "Add data to my Google Sheet"

The AI will refer to the configured tools available in its MCP servers to complete the task.

#### Get things done

With MCP-enabled AI, you can:

- Send messages and manage communication
- Create and update documents
- Query and analyze data
- Automate workflows across your favorite tools

All using your own connected accounts with full control and security.

</Steps>

### For developers

Deploy Pipedream's MCP servers to your application or agent and make authenticated request on behalf of your customers. Refer to our reference implementation [here](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/blob/master/modelcontextprotocol/README.md).

<Steps>

#### Prerequisites

To run your own MCP server, you'll need:

1. A [Pipedream account](https://pipedream.com/auth/signup)
2. A [Pipedream project](/projects/#creating-projects). Accounts connected via MCP will be stored here.
3. [Pipedream OAuth credentials](/connect/managed-auth/oauth-clients/)

#### Set up environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

#### Run the MCP server

Pipedream's MCP servers can run in two modes:

##### Stdio (for local testing)

```bash
npx @pipedream/mcp stdio --app slack --external-user-id user123
```

##### SSE (for hosting)

```bash
npx @pipedream/mcp sse
```

This exposes routes at:
- `GET /:external_user_id/:app` - App-specific SSE connection endpoint
- `POST /:external_user_id/:app/messages` - App-specific message handler

Where:
- `:external_user_id` is your user's unique identifier in your system
- `:app` is the app slug (e.g., "slack", "github")

#### Customize for your needs

You can host and customize the MCP server for your specific requirements:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream
cd pipedream/modelcontextprotocol

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Run the SSE server
npm run start:sse:prod
```

See the [MCP server README](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/blob/master/modelcontextprotocol/README.md) for detailed instructions on customization options.

</Steps>

## Security

MCP servers follow strict security best practices:

- **Credential isolation**:  Each user's credentials are stored securely and isolated from other users
- **No credential exposure**:  Credentials are never exposed to AI models or your client-side code
- **Request authentication**:  All requests to the MCP server are authenticated
- **Revocable access**:  Users can revoke access to their connected accounts at any time

For more information on security, see our [security documentation](/privacy-and-security/).

## Use cases

Pipedream's MCP servers enable AI assistants to perform a wide range of tasks:

- **Productivity automation**:  Schedule meetings, send emails, create documents
- **Data analysis**:  Query databases, analyze spreadsheets, generate reports
- **Content creation**:  Post social media updates, create marketing materials
- **Customer support**:  Respond to inquiries, create tickets, update CRM records
- **Developer workflows**:  Create issues, review code, deploy applications

## Supported tools

- Each MCP server provides tools specific to that app. Tools are automatically created based on Pipedream's registry of pre-built actions.
- You can find the supported tools for a given app on its MCP server page or search for specific actions here: [pipedream.com/expore](https://pipedream.com/explore#popular-actions).

## Known gaps and limitations

- Pipedream's MCP server doesn't yet support [configuring dynamic props](/connect/components/#configure-dynamic-props), which means LLMs may get confused when trying to configure props that require inputs from previous props
- As an end user, you need to manually add distinct MCP servers for every app you want to interact with, instead of using a single MCP server that contains tools for many APIs

## Pricing

- Anyone can use Pipedream's hosted MCP servers for their own use **for free**
- To deploy Pipedream's MCP servers to your own app or agent, you can get started for free in development mode
- [Visit the pricing page](https://pipedream.com/pricing?plan=Connect) when you're ready to ship to production
