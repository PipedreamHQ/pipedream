# Managed Auth Quickstart

<GlobalConnectProvider>

Pipedream Connect is the easiest way for your users to connect to [over {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs](https://pipedream.com/apps), **right in your product**. You can build in-app messaging, CRM syncs, AI agents, [and much more](/connect/use-cases/), all in a few minutes.

## Visual overview

Here's a high-level overview of how Connect works with your app:

Here's how Connect sits in your frontend and backend, and communicates with Pipedream's API:

## Getting started

We'll walk through these steps below with an interactive demo that lets you see an execute the code directly in the docs.

<Steps>

### Configure your environment

You'll need to do two things to add Pipedream Connect to your app:

1. [Connect to the Pipedream API from your server](#generate-a-short-lived-token). This lets you make secure calls to the Pipedream API to initiate the account connection flow and retrieve account credentials.
2. [Add the Pipedream SDK to your frontend](#connect-your-users-account) or redirect your users to [a Pipedream-hosted URL](/connect/connect-link/) to start the account connection flow.

If you're building your own app, you'll need to provide these credentials to the environment, or retrieve them from your secrets store:

```bash
# Used to authorize requests to the Pipedream API
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=development
PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

### Create a project in Pipedream

1. Open an existing Pipedream project or create a new one at [pipedream.com/projects](https://pipedream.com/projects)
2. Click the **Settings** tab, then copy your **Project ID**

### Create a Pipedream OAuth client

Pipedream uses OAuth to authorize requests to the REST API. To create an OAuth client:

1. Visit the [API settings](https://pipedream.com/settings/api) for your workspace
2. Create a new OAuth client and note the client ID and secret

You'll need these when configuring the SDK and making API requests.

### Generate a short-lived token

To securely initiate account connections for your users, you'll need to generate a short-lived token for your users and use that in the [account connection flow](#connect-your-users-account). See [the docs on Connect tokens](/connect/tokens/) for a general overview of why we need to create tokens and scope them to end users.

Check out the code below **try it yourself**:

<div className="not-prose">
  <TokenGenerationDemo />
</div>

Once you have a token, return it to your frontend to start the account connection flow for the user, or redirect them to a Pipedream-hosted URL with [Connect Link](#or-use-connect-link).

<Callout type="info">
Refer to the API docs for [full set of parameters you can pass](/connect/api/#create-token) in the `ConnectTokenCreate` call.
</Callout>

### Connect your user's account

You have two options when connecting an account for your user:

1. [Use the Pipedream SDK](#use-the-pipedream-sdk-in-your-frontend) in your frontend
2. [Use Connect Link](#or-use-connect-link) to deliver a hosted URL to your user

#### Use the Pipedream SDK in your frontend

Use this method when you want to handle the account connection flow yourself, in your app. For example, you might want to show a **Connect Slack** button in your app that triggers the account connection flow.

First, install the [Pipedream SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pipedream/sdk) in your frontend:

```bash
npm i --save @pipedream/sdk
```

When the user connects an account in your product, [pass the token from your backend](#generate-a-short-lived-token) and call `connectAccount`. This opens a Pipedream iFrame that guides the user through the account connection.

Try the interactive demo below to connect an account after generating a token in the previous step:

<div className="not-prose">
  <AccountConnectionDemo />
</div>

#### Or use Connect Link

Use this option when you can't execute JavaScript or open an iFrame in your environment (e.g. mobile apps) and instead want to share a URL with your end users.

The Connect Link URL opens a Pipedream-hosted page, guiding users through the account connection process. The URL is specific to the user and expires after 4 hours.

After generating a token in the [step above](#generate-a-short-lived-token), you can use the resulting Connect Link URL. Try it below:

<div className="not-prose">
  <ConnectLinkDemo />
</div>

<Callout type="info">
Make sure to add the `app` parameter to the end of the URL to specify the app.

Check out the [full API docs](/connect/api/#create-token) for all parameters you can pass when creating tokens, including setting redirect URLs for success or error cases.
</Callout>

### Make authenticated requests

Now that your users have connected an account, you can use their auth in one of a few ways:

1. [Expose 10k+ tools](/connect/components/) to your AI app or agent and call them on behalf of your customers
2. [Send custom requests](/connect/proxy/) to any one of the 2500+ APIs using the Connect API proxy
3. [Use Pipedream's visual workflow builder](/connect/workflows/) to define complex logic to run on behalf of your users
4. [Embed Pipedream components directly in your app](/connect/components/) to run actions and triggers on their behalf

### Deploy your app to production

- Test end to end in [development](/connect/managed-auth/environments/)
- Ship to production!
