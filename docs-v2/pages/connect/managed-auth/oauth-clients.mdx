# OAuth Clients

When connecting an account for any OAuth app via Pipedream Connect, we'll default to using Pipedream's official OAuth client, which enables you to quickly get up and running. [Read more about OAuth clients in Pipedream here](/connected-accounts/oauth-clients).

## Using Pipedream OAuth

There are two types of apps in Pipedream:

1. **Key-based**: These apps require static credentials, like API keys. Pipedream stores these credentials securely and exposes them via API.
2. **OAuth**: These apps require OAuth authorization. Pipedream manages the OAuth flow for these apps, ensuring you always have a fresh access token for requests.

<Callout type="info">
For any OAuth app that supports it, **you can always use your own client.** Your ability to use Pipedream's OAuth clients in production depends on the use case.
</Callout>

| Operation | Details | Environment |
|--------|---------|------------------------------|
| [Retrieve credentials via API](/connect/api#accounts) | Fetch the credentials for your end user from Pipedream's API to use in your application. | ✅ `development`<br />❌ `production` |
| [Invoke workflows](/connect/workflows) | Trigger any Pipedream workflow and use the connected account of your end user | ✅ `development`<br />❌ `production` |
| [Run components via API](/connect/components) | Run any action and deploy any trigger directly from your application | ✅ `development`<br />✅ `production` |
</div>

## Using a custom OAuth client

1. Follow the steps [here](/connected-accounts/oauth-clients#configuring-custom-oauth-clients) to create an OAuth client in Pipedream.
2. When connecting an account either via the [frontend SDK](/connect/quickstart#use-the-pipedream-sdk-in-your-frontend), make sure to include the `oauthAppId` in `pd.connectAccount()`.
3. If using [Connect Link](/connect/quickstart#or-use-connect-link), make sure to include the `oauthAppId` in the URL.
