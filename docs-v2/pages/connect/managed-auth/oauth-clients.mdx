# OAuth Clients

When connecting an account for any OAuth app via Pipedream Connect, we'll default to using Pipedream's official OAuth client, which enables you to quickly get up and running. [Read more about OAuth clients in Pipedream here](/integrations/connected-accounts/oauth-clients).

## Using Pipedream OAuth

There are two types of apps in Pipedream:

1. **Key-based**: These apps require static credentials, like API keys. Pipedream stores these credentials securely and exposes them via API.
2. **OAuth**: These apps require OAuth authorization. Pipedream manages the OAuth flow for these apps, ensuring you always have a fresh access token for requests.

<Callout type="info">
For any OAuth app that supports it, **you can always use your own client.** Your ability to use Pipedream's OAuth clients in production depends on the use case.
</Callout>

| Operation | Details | Environment |
|--------|---------|------------------------------|
| Retrieve user credentrials | [Fetch the credentials](/connect/api#accounts) for your end user from Pipedream's API to use in your app | ✅ `development`<br />❌ `production` |
| Invoke workflows | [Trigger any Pipedream workflow](/connect/workflows) and use the connected account of your end users | ✅ `development`<br />❌ `production` |
| Embed prebuilt tools | [Run any action and deploy any trigger](/connect/components) directly from your AI agent or app | ✅ `development`<br />✅ `production` |
| Proxy API requests | [Write custom code to interface with any integrated API](/connect/api-proxy) while avoiding dealing with user auth | ✅ `development`<br />✅ `production` |
</div>

## Using a custom OAuth client

1. Follow the steps [here](/integrations/oauth-clients#configuring-custom-oauth-clients) to create an OAuth client in Pipedream.
2. When connecting an account either via the [frontend SDK](/connect/managed-auth/quickstart/#use-the-pipedream-sdk-in-your-frontend), make sure to include the `oauthAppId` in `pd.connectAccount()`.
3. If using [Connect Link](/connect/managed-auth/quickstart/#or-use-connect-link), make sure to include the `oauthAppId` in the URL.
