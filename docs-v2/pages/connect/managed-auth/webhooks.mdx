# Connect Webhooks

When you [generate a Connect token](/connect/managed-auth/quickstart/#generate-a-short-lived-token), you can pass a `webhook_uri` parameter. Pipedream will send a POST request to this URL when the user completes the connection flow, or if an error occurs at any point. [See the API docs](/connect/api/#create-a-new-token) for details.

## Webhook events

- `CONNECTION_SUCCESS` - Sent when the user successfully connects their account
- `CONNECTION_ERROR` - Sent when an error occurs during the connection flow

## Webhook payload

### Successful connection

Please note that user credentials are not sent in the webhook request. To retrieve credentials, use the [Connect API to fetch the account](/connect/api/#retrieve-account-details-by-id) using the `account.id` provided in the webhook payload.
