# Users

To view or delete your users' connected accounts:

1. Open your project in Pipedream
2. Click the **Connect** tab on the left
3. Click the **Users** tab at the top

You'll see a list of all users, their connected accounts, and the option to delete any accounts from the UI. You can also retrieve and delete all your users via the API ([see the docs for reference](/connect/api/)).

## Connecting multiple accounts

Users can connect multiple accounts for many different apps, or for the same app (e.g., I can connect my Notion and Gmail accounts, as well as accounts for multiple Slack workspaces).

When retrieving account information [from the API](/connect/api/#accounts), you can filter by `external_user_id` and / or `app` to retrieve information for a specific user and / or app.

<Callout type="warning">
When running workflows on behalf of an end user, right now you can only use a single account for a given app. If there are multiple connected accounts for that app, **Pipedream will use the most recently created account**. See more info on running workflows for your users [here](/connect/workflows).
</Callout> 

## Deleting accounts

You can delete an individual connected account or an entire user and all associated accounts and resources from the UI or via the API.

### Deleting individual connected accounts

If you need more granular control, you can delete specific connected accounts instead of removing the entire user.

#### From the UI
1. Open the project in Pipedream
2. Navigate to the **Users** tab under **Connect**
3. Find the user whose accounts you want to manage
4. View all connected accounts for that user in the expanded section
5. Click the **Delete** button next to the specific account you want to remove

This allows for more granular control over which integrated services remain accessible to your users.

#### Via the API
You can delete specific connected accounts programmatically:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/{project_id}/accounts/{account_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
```

For complete API details including TypeScript and Node.js examples, [refer to the API reference](/connect/api/#delete-connected-account).

### Deleting users

When you delete a user, all of their connected accounts and deployed resources (if any) are permanently removed from Pipedream. There are two ways to delete users:

#### From the UI
1. Open the project in Pipedream
2. Navigate to the **Users** tab under **Connect**
3. Locate the user you wish to delete
4. Click the **Delete User** button from the overlow menu at the end of the row

<Callout type="danger">
Deleting a user is permanent and cannot be undone. All connected accounts for this user will be permanently removed.
</Callout>

#### Via the API
You can delete a user programmatically using the Pipedream API:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/{project_id}/users/{external_user_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
```

For complete API details including TypeScript and Node.js examples, see the [API reference](/connect/api/#delete-an-end-user).
