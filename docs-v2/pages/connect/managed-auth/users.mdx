# Users

To view or delete your users' connected accounts:

1. Open your project in Pipedream
2. Click the **Connect** tab on the left
3. Click the **Users** tab at the top

You'll see a list of all users, their connected accounts, and the option to delete any accounts from the UI. You can also retrieve and delete all your users via the API ([see the docs for reference](/connect/api)).

<Callout type="warning">
Connect currently supports one connected account per user, app, environment combination.

So if user `abc-123` in your application connects their Slack account in `production`, then that same user connects a different Slack workspace (also in `production`), the first connected account will get overwritten in Pipedream and replaced by the second.
