# Pipedream Connect

## Overview

Pipedream Connect is the easiest way for your users to connect to over {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs, **right in your product**. 

Connect enables your users to authorize API access for Slack, GitHub, and more, directly in your app. You can then retrieve fresh credentials for any account, making authenticated requests on their behalf. Pipedream handles the security of credentials and the whole OAuth flow — **no need to manage authorization grants or token refresh yourself.**

Since it's your app, you have full control over how these integrations work. You handle the product, Pipedream takes care of the auth. Connect provides:

1. A [Client SDK](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/packages/sdk) to initiate authorization or accept API keys on behalf of your users, for any of the [{process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs](https://pipedream.com/apps) available on Pipedream
2. A [REST API](#rest-api-overview) to retrieve credentials for your end users — OAuth access tokens, API keys, and other credentials stored for them
3. The Pipedream platform and its [serverless runtime](/), [thousands of pre-built source-available triggers and actions](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/components), and a first-class developer experience to build, test, and deploy custom workflows

Pipedream takes security seriously. Please [review our security docs](/privacy-and-security) and send us any questions or [suspected vulnerabilities](/privacy-and-security#reporting-a-vulnerability). You can also get a copy of our [SOC 2 Type 2 report](/privacy-and-security#soc-2), [sign HIPAA BAAs](/privacy-and-security#hipaa), and get information on other practices and controls.

**Pipedream Connect is currently in preview, and we're looking for feedback!**

**In the preview phase, the API may change without notice. We'll do our best to communicate changes, but please be aware that breaking changes may occur.**

Please [let us know](mailto:connect@pipedream.com) how you're using it, what's not working, and what else you'd like to see.
</Callout>

## Glossary of terms

- **App**: GitHub, Notion, Slack, Google Sheets, and more. The app is the API you want your users to connect to in your product. See the [full list here](https://pipedream.com/apps).
- **Developer**: This is probably you, the Pipedream customer who's developing an app and wants to use Connect to make API requests on behalf of their end users.
- **End User**: Your customer or user, whose data you want to access on their behalf. End users are identifed via the `external_id` param in the Connect SDK and API.
- **Connected Account**: The account your end user connects. [Read more about connected accounts](/connected-accounts).
- **OAuth Client**: Custom OAuth clients you create in Pipedream. [Read more about OAuth clients](/connected-accounts/oauth-clients).

## Getting started

<Steps>

### Enable the feature flag

Enable the feature flag for **Pipedream Connect** in your [account settings](https://pipedream.com/settings/alpha).

### Choose the apps you want to integrate

There are two types of apps in Pipedream:

1. **Key-based**: These apps require static credentials, like API keys. Pipedream stores these credentials securely and exposes them via API.
2. **OAuth**: These apps require OAuth authorization. Pipedream manages the OAuth flow for these apps, ensuring you always have a fresh access token for requests.

Connecting Key-based apps with the Pipedream API requires only [the app's name slug](#find-your-apps-name-slug). OAuth apps require you to [create your own OAuth client](#creating-a-custom-oauth-client) and pass the OAuth app ID, as well.

#### Find your app's name slug

1. Visit [https://pipedream.com/apps](https://pipedream.com/apps)
2. Search and select the app you want to integrate
3. In the **Authentication** section, copy the **Name slug**.

Typically, the name slug is the name of the app in lowercase, with spaces replaced by underscores. For example, the name slug for the GitHub app is `github`. The name slug for [Google Sheets](https://pipedream.com/apps/google-sheets#authentication) is `google_sheets`.

<br />

#### Creating a custom OAuth client

First, [create an OAuth client](/connected-accounts/oauth-clients#configuring-custom-oauth-clients) for the app you'd like to integrate.

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure to check the **Enable for Pipedream Connect** setting in the OAuth client configuration in Pipedream to allow your end users to connect their accounts. By default, OAuth clients are accessible only to members of your Pipedream workspace. Checking this box allows your end users to create accounts for this app, too.

<br />
<Image src="https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1723760958/enable-oauth-client-for-pd-connect_ipkzmo.png" alt="Enable OAuth client for Pipedream Connect" width={450} height={300} />
</Callout>

Once that's done, copy the OAuth app ID from the app configuration.

<Image src="https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1723761240/copy-oauth-app-id_on6d8p.png" alt="Copy your OAuth app ID" width={550} height={300} />

### Get your project keys

Open an existing Pipedream project or create a new one: [https://pipedream.com/projects](https://pipedream.com/projects).

Find your **Project Public Key** and **Project Secret Key** from the **Connect** tab within your project — you'll need these when configuring the SDK and making API requests.

<Image src="https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1723761665/proj-connect-keys_bodybd.png" alt="Project keys in the Connect tab" width={650} height={300} />

### Run the Pipedream demo app, or configure your own

You'll need to do two things to integrate Pipedream Connect into your app:

1. [Connect to the Pipedream API from your server](#connect-to-the-pipedream-api-from-your-server). This lets you make secure calls to the Pipedream API to initiate the account connection flow and retrieve account credentials. If you're running a JavaScript framework like Node.js on the server, you can use the Pipedream SDK.
2. [Add the Pipedream SDK to your frontend](#add-the-pipedream-sdk-to-your-frontend). This lets you kick off the account connection flow for your end users.

**DEVELOPER FLOW SCREENSHOT**

We'll walk through these steps below, using [a Next.js app](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/packages/sdk/examples/next-app/) as an example. If you'd like to run that code, clone the repo and follow the instructions in the example app `README`. That will run the app on `localhost:3000`.

In the example app, we provide an `.env.example` file that shows you the environment variables required to run the app:

```bash
# Specific to Next.js — see `app/page.tsx` for how these are used
NEXT_PUBLIC_PIPEDREAM_APP_SLUG=github
NEXT_PUBLIC_PIPEDREAM_APP_ID=oa_abc123

# Used by `app/server.ts` to authorize requests to the Pipedream API — see below
PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_PUBLIC_KEY=pub_abc123
PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_SECRET_KEY=sec_abc123
```

If you're building your own app, you'll need to provide these values to its environment, or retrieve them from your secrets store.

### Connect to the Pipedream API from your server

<Callout type="info">
**Why do I need to talk to the Pipedream API from my server?**

You need to secure specific operations, for example:

- You need to initiate the account connection flow for your end users. In Pipedream Connect, **you exchange your project keys for a short-lived token that allows a specific user to connect a specific app**, and return that token to your frontend. If you expose your Pipedream project keys directly to the frontend, anyone could initiate the account connection flow for any user, and you'd be charged for those accounts.
- You need to retrieve account credentials for your end users. Again, this should happen securely on your server, not in the frontend, to protect your users' data.

</Callout>

In this Next.js example, we're running Node.js code on our server, via [Next server components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components), so we'll use the Pipedream SDK. Additional examples in Python, Ruby, and other languages are noted below.

To install the [Pipedream SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pipedream/sdk) in your own project, run:

```bash
npm i --save @pipedream/sdk
```

To create a short-lived token via SDK, you'll need to create a Pipedream API client and call the `connectTokenCreate` method. In our example app, this code is in `app/server.ts`. Click into other tabs to see examples in additional languages.

```typescript
import {
  createClient,
  type ConnectTokenCreateOpts,
  type ConnectTokenResponse,
} from "@pipedream/sdk";

const pd = createClient({
  publicKey: PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_PUBLIC_KEY,
  secretKey: PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_SECRET_KEY,
});

export async function serverConnectTokenCreate(opts: ConnectTokenCreateOpts): Promise<ConnectTokenResponse> {
  return pd.connectTokenCreate(opts);
}
```

In our Next.js app, we call this method [from the frontend](#add-the-pipedream-sdk-to-your-frontend) to initiate the account connection flow **for a specific user, and a specific app**:

```typescript
import { serverConnectTokenCreate } from "./server"

const { token, expires_at } = await serverConnectTokenCreate({
  app_slug: appSlug,  // The app's name slug, passed from the frontend
  oauth_client_id: oauthAppId,  // The OAuth app ID, if you're connecting an OAuth app — keep this in config / a DB, pass here
  external_id: externalUserId  // The end user's ID in your system
});
```

If you're using a different server / API framework, you'll need to make secure calls to that API to create a new token for your users. For example, you might validate a user's session, then call the Pipedream API to create a new token for that user.

### Add the Pipedream SDK to your frontend

Install the [Pipedream SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pipedream/sdk):

```bash
npm i --save @pipedream/sdk
```

### Get a token

In our example app, `app/page.tsx` imports the SDK and the token creation code we wrote above:

```typescript
// Note that we import the browser-specific SDK client here
import { createClient } from "@pipedream/sdk/browser"
import { serverConnectTokenCreate } from "./server"

const { token, expires_at } = await serverConnectTokenCreate({
  app_slug: appSlug,  // The app's name slug
  oauth_client_id: oauthAppId,  // The OAuth app ID, if you're connecting an OAuth app
  external_id: externalUserId  // The end user's ID in your system
});
```

### Connect your account from the frontend

Once you have a token, you can use it to connect an account. In our example, `app/page.tsx` calls the `connectAccount` method from the Pipedream SDK when the user clicks the **Connect your account** button.

<br />
<Image src="https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1723762300/connect-account-button_ugkdrd.png" alt="Connect your account button" width={550} height={300} />

```typescript
export default function Home() {
  pd.connectAccount({
    app: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PIPEDREAM_APP_SLUG,
    token,
    onSuccess: ({ id: authProvisionId }) => {
      setAuthProvisionId(authProvisionId as string)
    }
  })

  return (
    <main>
      <button style={{ all: "revert" }} onClick={connectAccount}>Connect your account</button>
    </main>
  )
}
```

Press that button to connect an account for the app you configured.

### Retrieve the credentials from the backend

Once the user has connected their account, you can retrieve their credentials from your backend with your project keys.

```typescript
import {
  createClient,
} from "@pipedream/sdk";

const pd = createClient({
  publicKey: PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_PUBLIC_KEY,
  secretKey: PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_SECRET_KEY,
});

const data = await pd.getAccount({
  appId: appSlug, // The app's name slug whose credentials you want to retrieve
  externalId, // The end user's ID in your system
}, {
  includeCredentials: true,
});
```

### Deploy your app to production

Once you have the app working locally and want to deploy it to production, you'll need to [verify the domain](/workspaces/domain-verification#pipedream-connect) where the app will be hosted. This secures the account-connection process by ensuring that the app is hosted on a domain you control.

</Steps>

### REST API Overview

<Callout type="warning">
Note that both the Base URL and authentication method for the Connect REST API are different from the rest of Pipedream's REST API.
</Callout>

**Base URL for all Connect requests**
```
https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect
```

**Authentication**

You authenticate to the Connect REST API using **Basic Auth**. Send your Pipedream [Project Public Key]() as the username and the [Project Secret Key]() as the password. When you make API requests, pass an
`Authorization` header of the following format:

```
Authorization: Basic <Base 64 encoded public_key:secret_key>
```

For example, here's how you can use `cURL` to fetch a list of all accounts in your project:

```shell
curl 'https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/accounts' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <Base 64 encoded public_key:secret_key>'
```

### API Reference

#### Delete individual connected account
Delete a specific connected account for an end user

```
DELETE /v1/connect/accounts/:apn_id
```

- `:apn_id` is the auth provision of the account you want to retrieve
- We'll return a `204 No Content` response if the account was successfully deleted

#### Delete all connected accounts for a specific app

```
DELETE /apps/:app_id/accounts
```

- `:app_id` can be `oauth_app_id` or `app_id`
- We'll return a `204 No Content` response if the accounts were successfully deleted

#### Delete an end user and all their connected accounts

```
DELETE /users/:external_id
```

- `external_id` refers to the end user's ID in your system — whatever unique identifer you assign to your customers.
- We'll return a `204 No Content` response if the user was successfully deleted

## Plans and pricing

- The core billing model is based on the number of end users across projects in your Pipedream workspace
- During the preview phase, Pipedream Connect is available to Advanced and Business customers at no additional cost, with a limited number of end users during the preview phase

## Product roadmap for Connect

- Address bugs and feedback during the preview phase
- Invoke Pipedream workflows on behalf of end users
- Improve error handling for Connect developers and end users
- And more!
