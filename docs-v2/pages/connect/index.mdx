# Pipedream Connect

**Connect provides a developer toolkit that lets you add {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ integrations to your app or AI agent.** You can build AI agents, in-app messaging, CRM syncs, [and much more](/connect/use-cases/), all in a few minutes. You have full, code-level control over how these integrations work in your app. You handle your product, Pipedream simplifies the integration.

## Use managed auth

- Handle authorization or accept API keys on behalf of your users, for any of Pipedream's [{process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs](https://pipedream.com/apps)
- Use the [Client SDK](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/packages/sdk) or [Connect Link](/connect/managed-auth/quickstart/#or-use-connect-link) to accept auth in minutes
- Ship new integrations quickly with Pipedream's approved OAuth clients, or use your own


## Act on behalf of your users

- Retrieve OAuth access tokens and API keys for your end users with Pipedream's [REST API](/connect/api/)
- Add 10k pre-built tools and triggers from {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs to your AI agent or embed them directly in your SaaS app
- Develop and deploy complex multi-step [workflows](/connect/workflows/) in our best-in-class [visual builder](/workflows/building-workflows/)
- Send custom API requests while still avoiding dealing with customer credentials with the [Connect proxy](/connect/api-proxy/)

## Security

Pipedream takes the security of our products seriously. See [details on Connect security](/privacy-and-security/#pipedream-connect) and [our general security docs](/privacy-and-security/). Please send us any questions or [suspected vulnerabilities](/privacy-and-security/#reporting-a-vulnerability). You can also get a copy of our [SOC 2 Type 2 report](/privacy-and-security/#soc-2), [sign HIPAA BAAs](/privacy-and-security/#hipaa), and get information on other practices and controls.

### Storing user credentials, token refresh

All credentials and tokens are sent to Pipedream securely over HTTPS, and encrypted at rest. [See our security docs on credentials](/privacy-and-security/#third-party-oauth-grants-api-keys-and-environment-variables) for more information.

### How to secure your Connect apps

- **Secure all secrets** — Secure your Pipedream OAuth client credentials, and especially any user credentials. Never expose secrets in your client-side code. Make all requests to Pipedream's API and third-party APIs from your server-side code.
- **Use HTTPS** — Always use HTTPS to secure your connections between your client and server. Requests to Pipedream's API will be automatically redirected to HTTPS.
- **Use secure, session-based auth between your client and server** — authorize all requests from your client to your server using a secure, session-based auth mechanism. Use well-known identity providers with services like [Clerk](https://clerk.com/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), or [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) to securely generate and validate authentication tokens. The same follows for Pipedream workflows — if you trigger Pipedream workflows from your client or server, validate all requests in the workflow before executing workflow code.
- **Secure your workflows** — See our [standard security practices](/privacy-and-security/best-practices) for recommendations on securing your Pipedream workflows.

## Glossary of terms

- **App**: GitHub, Notion, Slack, Google Sheets, and more. The app is the API you want your users to connect to in your product. See the [full list here](https://pipedream.com/apps).
- **Developer**: This is probably you, the Pipedream customer who's developing an app and wants to use Connect to make API requests on behalf of your end users.
- **End User**: Your customer or user, whose data you want to access on their behalf. End users are identifed via the `external_user_id` param in the Connect SDK and API.
- **Connected Account**: The account your end user connects. [Read more about connected accounts](/integrations/connected-accounts).
- **OAuth Client**: This is admittedly a bit of an overloaded term and refers both to [custom OAuth clients](/connect/managed-auth/oauth-clients/) you create in Pipedream to use when your end users authorize access to their account, as well as [OAuth clients to authenticate to Pipedream's API](/rest-api/auth/#oauth).
