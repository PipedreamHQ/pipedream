# Pipedream Connect

## Overview

Pipedream Connect is the easiest way for your users to connect to over {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs, **right in your product**. Visit [the quickstart](/connect/quickstart) to build your first integration.

Connect enables your users to authorize API access for Slack, GitHub, and more, directly in your app. You can then retrieve fresh credentials for any account, making authenticated requests on their behalf. Pipedream handles the security of credentials and the whole OAuth flow — **no need to manage authorization grants or token refresh yourself.**

Since it's your app, you have full control over how these integrations work. You handle the product, Pipedream takes care of the auth. Connect provides:

1. A [Client SDK](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/packages/sdk) to initiate authorization or accept API keys on behalf of your users, for any of the [{process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs](https://pipedream.com/apps) available on Pipedream
2. A [REST API](#rest-api-overview) to retrieve credentials for your end users — OAuth access tokens, API keys, and other credentials stored for them
3. The Pipedream platform and its [serverless runtime](/), [thousands of pre-built source-available triggers and actions](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/components), and a first-class developer experience to build, test, and deploy custom workflows

## Glossary of terms

- **App**: GitHub, Notion, Slack, Google Sheets, and more. The app is the API you want your users to connect to in your product. See the [full list here](https://pipedream.com/apps).
- **Developer**: This is probably you, the Pipedream customer who's developing an app and wants to use Connect to make API requests on behalf of your end users.
- **End User**: Your customer or user, whose data you want to access on their behalf. End users are identifed via the `external_id` param in the Connect SDK and API.
- **Connected Account**: The account your end user connects. [Read more about connected accounts](/connected-accounts).
- **OAuth Client**: Custom OAuth clients you create in Pipedream. [Read more about OAuth clients](/connected-accounts/oauth-clients).

## Getting started

Visit [the quickstart](/connect/quickstart) to build your first integration.

## Plans and pricing

During the preview phase, Connect is free to use.

After the preview phase, Pipedream is likely to charge on the number of end users who have active accounts in your workspace's projects. Any prices will be clearly communicated, and you can delete unused end user accounts at any time.

Please let us know if you have any feedback on the value of Connect and how you'd like to see it priced.

## Product roadmap for Connect

- Address bugs and feedback during the preview phase
