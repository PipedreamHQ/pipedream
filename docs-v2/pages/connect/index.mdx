# Pipedream Connect

<Callout type="info">
**Pipedream Connect is currently in preview, and we're looking for design partners to pair with us on the product roadmap and provide feedback**. If you're building apps, AI agents, or anything else that needs to integrate with many third-party APIs, please reach out at `connect@pipedream.com` or our [Slack community](https://pipedream.com/support)

During the preview phase, Connect is free to use for any workspace. The API may change without notice, which may cause breaking changes. We'll do our best to communicate these changes. Please let us know how you're using it, what's not working, and what else you'd like to see.
</Callout>

Pipedream Connect is the easiest way for your users to connect to [over {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs](https://pipedream.com/apps), **right in your product**. You can build in-app messaging, CRM syncs, AI agents, [and much more](/connect/use-cases), all in a few minutes. Visit [the quickstart](/connect/quickstart) to build your first integration.

You have full, code-level control over how these integrations work in your app. You handle your product, Pipedream simplifies the integration. 

Connect lets you:

1. Handle authorization or accept API keys on behalf of your users, for any of Pipedream's [{process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs](https://pipedream.com/apps). Use the [Client SDK](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/packages/sdk) or [Connect Link](/connect/quickstart#use-connect-link) to accept auth in minutes.
2. Securely retrieve OAuth access tokens, API keys, and other credentials for your end users with Pipedream's [REST API](/connect/api)
3. Run workflows for your end users with Pipedream's [workflow builder](/workflows), [serverless runtime](/), and thousands of no-code [triggers](/workflows/triggers) and [actions](/workflows/actions). Build complex integrations in minutes, writing code when you need it and using no-code components when you don't. Pipedream workflows are easy to modify, debug, and scale.

## Security

Pipedream takes the security of our products seriously. See [details on Connect security](/privacy-and-security#pipedream-connect) and [our general security docs](/privacy-and-security). Please send us any questions or [suspected vulnerabilities](/privacy-and-security#reporting-a-vulnerability). You can also get a copy of our [SOC 2 Type 2 report](/privacy-and-security#soc-2), [sign HIPAA BAAs](/privacy-and-security#hipaa), and get information on other practices and controls.

### Storing user credentials, token refresh

All credentials and tokens are sent to Pipedream securely over HTTPS, and encrypted at rest. [See our security docs on credentials](/privacy-and-security#third-party-oauth-grants-api-keys-and-environment-variables) for more information.

### How to secure your Connect apps

- **Secure all secrets** — Secure your Pipedream OAuth client credentials, and especially any user credentials. Never expose secrets in your client-side code. Make all requests to Pipedream's API and third-party APIs from your server-side code.
- **Use HTTPS** — Always use HTTPS to secure your connections between your client and server. Requests to Pipedream's API will be automatically redirected to HTTPS.
- **Use secure, session-based auth between your client and server** — authorize all requests from your client to your server using a secure, session-based auth mechanism. Use well-known identity providers with services like [Clerk](https://clerk.com/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), or [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) to securely generate and validate authentication tokens. The same follows for Pipedream workflows — if you trigger Pipedream workflows from your client or server, validate all requests in the workflow before executing workflow code.
- **Secure your workflows** — See our [standard security practices](/privacy-and-security/best-practices) for recommendations on securing your Pipedream workflows.
