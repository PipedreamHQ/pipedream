# Pipedream Connect

## Overview

Pipedream Connect is the easiest way for your users to connect to any API, **right in your product**.

Connect enables you to easily integrate more than {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs into your product. Your users connect their API accounts for Slack, GitHub, and more, directly in your app. You can then retrieve fresh credentials for any account via API, making authenticated requests on their behalf. Pipedream handles the security of credentials and the whole OAuth flow — no need to manage authorization grants or token refresh yourself. 

Connect includes:

1. A [Client SDK](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/packages/sdk) to initiate authorization for any one of the [{process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs](https://pipedream.com/apps) available on Pipedream
2. A [REST API](#rest-api-overview) to retrieve credentials (OAuth access tokens, API keys, etc.) for your end users
3. The Pipedream platform and its [serverless runtime](/), [thousands of pre-built source-available triggers and actions](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/components), and a first-class developer experience to build, test, and deploy custom workflows

<Callout type="info">
**Pipedream Connect is currently in preview, and we're looking for feedback!**

**In the preview phase, the API may change without notice. We'll do our best to communicate changes, but please be aware that breaking changes may occur.**

Please [let us know](mailto:connect@pipedream.com) how you're using it, what's not working, and what else you'd like to see.
</Callout>

## Glossary of terms

- **App**: GitHub, Notion, Slack, Google Sheets, and more. The app is the API you want your users to connect to in your product. See the [full list here](https://pipedream.com/apps).
- **Developer**: This is probably you: the Pipedream customer who's developing an app and wants to use Connect to make API requests on behalf of their end users.
- **End User**: Your customer or user, whose data you want to access on their behalf. End users are identifed via the `external_id` param in Pipedream.
- **Connected Account**: The account your end user connects. [Read more about connected accounts](/connected-accounts).
- **OAuth Client**: Custom OAuth clients you create in Pipedream. [Read more about OAuth clients](/connected-accounts/oauth-clients).

## Getting started

<Steps>

### Enable the feature flag

Enable the feature flag for **Pipedream Connect** in your [account settings](https://pipedream.com/settings/alpha).

### Verify your application's domain

To integrate [the client SDK](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/packages/sdk) on your site, you'll need to verify ownership of your web domain. [See the domain validation docs](workspaces/domain-verification#pipedream-connect) to get started.

When developing locally, the following origins are automatically validated:

```plaintext
http://localhost
https://localhost
http://localhost:3000
http://localhost:5000
http://localhost:8000
http://localhost:8080
```

### Choose the apps you want to integrate

There are two types of apps in Pipedream:

1. **Key-based**: These apps require static credentials, like API keys. Pipedream stores these credentials securely and exposes them via API.
2. **OAuth**: These apps require OAuth authorization. Pipedream manages the OAuth flow for these apps, ensuring you always have a fresh access token for requests.

#### Key-based apps

#### OAuth apps

To use Pipedream Connect with OAuth apps, you'll need to create your own OAuth client. [See the docs](/connected-accounts/oauth-clients#configuring-custom-oauth-clients) to create a client.

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure to check the **Enable for Pipedream Connect** setting in the OAuth client configuration in Pipedream to allow end users to connect their accounts. By default, OAuth clients are accessible only to members of your Pipedream workspace.

**SCREENSHOT**
</Callout>

Once that's done, copy the OAuth app ID from the app configuration.

**SCREEENSHOT**

### Open your Pipedream project

- Open an existing Pipedream project or create a new one: [https://pipedream.com/projects](https://pipedream.com/projects)
- Note your **Project Public Key** and **Project Secret Key** from the **Connect** tab within your project — you'll need these when configuring the SDK and making API requests

### Run the example app

- Install the [SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pipedream/sdk) via npm: `npm install @pipedream/sdk`
- The code for the Pipedream SDK lives in the [public pipedream repo](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/packages/sdk)
- Check out the example app and README there to get started

### Retrieve your user credentials from Pipedream's API

- Check out to the API reference below to retrieve your users' credentials from Pipedream's API after they've connected their account.

</Steps>

## Retrieving account details and user credentials

After your end users have connected their account using Pipedream Connect, you can retrieve their credentials using Pipedream's REST API, which enables you to make authenticated requests on their behalf.

### REST API Overview

<Callout type="warning">
Note that both the Base URL and authentication method for the Connect REST API are different from the rest of Pipedream's REST API.
</Callout>

**Base URL for all Connect requests**
```
https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect
```

**Authentication**

You authenticate to the Connect REST API using **Basic Auth**. Send your Pipedream [Project Public Key]() as the username and the [Project Secret Key]() as the password. When you make API requests, pass an
`Authorization` header of the following format:

```
Authorization: Basic <Base 64 encoded public_key:secret_key>
```

For example, here's how you can use `cURL` to fetch a list of all accounts in your project:

```shell
curl 'https://api.pipedream.com/v1/connect/accounts' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <Base 64 encoded public_key:secret_key>'
```

### API Reference

#### List all accounts

List all connected accounts for all end users within your project

<Callout type="warning">
This endpoint is not currently paginated, so we'll attempt to return all connected accounts for all users within your project. We intend to add pagination soon.
</Callout>

```
GET /accounts/
```

#### Delete individual connected account
Delete a specific connected account for an end user

```
DELETE /v1/connect/accounts/:apn_id
```

- `:apn_id` is the auth provision of the account you want to retrieve
- We'll return a `204 No Content` response if the account was successfully deleted

#### Delete all connected accounts for a specific app

```
/DELETE /apps/:app_id/accounts
```

- `:app_id` can be `oauth_app_id` or `app_id`
- We'll return a `204 No Content` response if the accounts were successfully deleted

#### Delete an end user and all their connected accounts

```
DELETE /users/:external_id
```

- `external_id` refers to the end user's ID in your system — whatever unique identifer you assign to your customers.
- We'll return a `204 No Content` response if the user was successfully deleted

## Plans and pricing

- The core billing model will be based on the number of end users in your Pipedream workspace
- During the preview phase, Pipedream Connect is available to Advanced and Business customers at no additional cost, with a limited number of end users during the preview phase

## Product roadmap for Connect

- Address bugs and feedback during the preview phase
- Invoke Pipedream workflows on behalf of end users
- Improve error handling for Connect developers and end users
- And more
