## Overview

Connect enables you to easily integrate more than {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs directly into your application, letting you make authenticated requests on behalf of your end users, while not having to worry about authorization grants or refresh tokens, and includes these features:
1. [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/packages/sdk) to initiate authorization for any one of the [{process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs](https://pipedream.com/apps) available on Pipedream
2. [REST API](/connected-accounts/api) to retrieve credentials (access token, API key, etc.) for your end users
3. [Serverless runtime platform](/), [thousands of pre-built source-available triggers and actions](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/components), and a first-class developer experience to build, test, and deploy custom workflows
