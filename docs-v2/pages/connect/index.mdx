# Pipedream Connect

Pipedream Connect is the easiest way for your users to connect to [over {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs](https://pipedream.com/apps), **right in your product**. You can build in-app messaging, CRM syncs, AI agents, [and much more](/connect/use-cases), all in a few minutes. Visit [the quickstart](/connect/quickstart) to build your first integration.

You have full, code-level control over how these integrations work in your app. You handle your product, Pipedream simplifies the integration. 

Connect lets you:

1. Handle authorization or accept API keys on behalf of your users, for any of Pipedream's [{process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs](https://pipedream.com/apps). Use the [Client SDK](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/packages/sdk) or [Connect Link](/connect/quickstart#or-use-connect-link) to accept auth in minutes.
2. Securely retrieve OAuth access tokens, API keys, and other credentials for your end users with Pipedream's [REST API](/connect/api).
3. [Embed any Pipedream action or trigger](/connect/components) to run on behalf of your users, directly from within your application.
4. [Run workflows](/connect/workflows) for your end users with Pipedream's [workflow builder](/workflows), [serverless runtime](/), and thousands of no-code [triggers](/workflows/triggers) and [actions](/workflows/actions). Build complex integrations in minutes, writing code when you need it and using no-code components when you don't. Pipedream workflows are easy to modify, debug, and scale.

## Use cases

Pipedream Connect lets you build any API integration into your product in minutes. Our customers build:

- **In-app messaging**: Send messages to Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, or any app directly from your product.
- **CRM syncs**: Sync data between your app and Salesforce, HubSpot, or any CRM
- **AI products**: Talk to any AI API or LLM, interacting with your users or running AI-driven asynchronous tasks
- **Spreadsheet integrations**: Sync data between your app and Google Sheets, Airtable, or any spreadsheet

[and much more](/connect/use-cases).

## Getting started

Visit [the managed auth quickstart](/connect/quickstart) to build your first integration.

## App configuration for OAuth apps

Pipedream has more than {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS} apps available for you to integrate via Connect. Getting started is easy — just follow the [quickstart](/connect/quickstart) to get up and running.

By default, apps that use OAuth to authenticate will use Pipedream's OAuth client. Depending on your use case, you may need to configure your own OAuth client. Read more about OAuth clients in Pipedream [here](/connected-accounts/oauth-clients).

[Let us know](https://pipedream.com/support) if the app you're looking for isn't listed [here](https://pipedream.com/apps).

## Users

To view or delete your users' connected accounts:

1. Open your project in Pipedream
2. Click the **Connect** tab on the left
3. Click the **Users** tab at the top

You'll see a list of all users, their connected accounts, and the option to delete any accounts from the UI. You can also retrieve and delete all your users via the API ([see the docs for reference](/connect/api)).

<Callout type="warning">
Connect currently supports one connected account per user, app, environment combination.

So if user `abc-123` in your application connects their Slack account in `production`, then that same user connects a different Slack workspace (also in `production`), the first connected account will get overwritten in Pipedream and replaced by the second.
</Callout>

## Plans and pricing

**Managed authentication with Connect is free to use for up to 1,000 connected accounts for any workspace**. Check out our [pricing page](https://pipedream.com/pricing?plan=Enterprise) for details on running workflows and embedding components in your app.

## Security

Pipedream takes the security of our products seriously. See [details on Connect security](/privacy-and-security#pipedream-connect) and [our general security docs](/privacy-and-security). Please send us any questions or [suspected vulnerabilities](/privacy-and-security#reporting-a-vulnerability). You can also get a copy of our [SOC 2 Type 2 report](/privacy-and-security#soc-2), [sign HIPAA BAAs](/privacy-and-security#hipaa), and get information on other practices and controls.

### Storing user credentials, token refresh

All credentials and tokens are sent to Pipedream securely over HTTPS, and encrypted at rest. [See our security docs on credentials](/privacy-and-security#third-party-oauth-grants-api-keys-and-environment-variables) for more information.

### How to secure your Connect apps

- **Secure all secrets** — Secure your Pipedream OAuth client credentials, and especially any user credentials. Never expose secrets in your client-side code. Make all requests to Pipedream's API and third-party APIs from your server-side code.
- **Use HTTPS** — Always use HTTPS to secure your connections between your client and server. Requests to Pipedream's API will be automatically redirected to HTTPS.
- **Use secure, session-based auth between your client and server** — authorize all requests from your client to your server using a secure, session-based auth mechanism. Use well-known identity providers with services like [Clerk](https://clerk.com/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), or [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) to securely generate and validate authentication tokens. The same follows for Pipedream workflows — if you trigger Pipedream workflows from your client or server, validate all requests in the workflow before executing workflow code.
- **Secure your workflows** — See our [standard security practices](/privacy-and-security/best-practices) for recommendations on securing your Pipedream workflows.
