# Pipedream Connect

<Callout type="info">
Pipedream Connect is currently in **preview** and we're looking for feedback!

**While in the preview phase, the API may change without notice. We'll do our best to communicate any changes, but please be aware that breaking changes may occur.**

Please [let us know](https://pipedream.com/support) how you're using it, what's not working, and what else you'd like to see!
</Callout>

## Overview

Connect enables you to easily integrate more than {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs directly into your application, letting you make authenticated requests on behalf of your end users, while not having handle authorization grants or refresh tokens yourself, and it includes these features:
1. [Client SDK](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/packages/sdk) to initiate authorization for any one of the [{process.env.PUBLIC_APPS}+ APIs](https://pipedream.com/apps) available on Pipedream
2. [REST API](/connected-accounts/api) to retrieve credentials (access token, API key, etc.) for your end users
3. The rest of Pipedream, which includes [a serverless runtime platform](/), [thousands of pre-built source-available triggers and actions](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/components), and a first-class developer experience to build, test, and deploy custom workflows
