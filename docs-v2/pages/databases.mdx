# Working with Databases
Connecting to databases is a fundamental aspect of creating powerful workflows for your applications. Whether you're storing application data, querying user information, or analyzing event logs, most workflows require querying data at some step.

Every Pipedream workflow is deployed to its own virtual machine in AWS. This means your workflow runs in its own execution environment with dedicated RAM and disk space, isolated from other users' workflows.

However, outbound traffic from your workflows uses the same network as other AWS services in the us-east-1 region. **This means your workflows share AWS's `us-east-1` network, sending requests from standard AWS IP ranges.**

## How to Connect to Restricted Databases
When you need to connect to a database that restricts access to a specific set of IP addresses, you have a couple options:

### Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- The most secure, recommended approach, since it gives you a dedicated static IP only for workflows within your workspace
- Learn more about VPCs [here](/workflows/vpcs/)

### Use Pipedream's SQL Proxy
- The Pipedream SQL Proxy routes network requests through a static IP block
- When you create a connected account with any of [the apps](#supported-databases) that are currently supported by the SQL Proxy, steps using that account will route through the SQL Proxy, using the static IPs listed below.

#### Supported Databases
The SQL Proxy currently supports [MySQL](https://pipedream.com/apps/mysql), [PostgreSQL](https://pipedream.com/apps/postgresql), and [Snowflake](https://pipedream.com/apps/snowflake). Please let us know if you'd like to see support for other database types!

#### Static IPs
For database allow-listing, add the following IP block:
```
44.223.89.56/29
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### What's the difference between the SQL Proxy and a VPC?
- While both the SQL Proxy and a VPC enable secure database connections, a VPC offers enhanced isolation and security by providing a dedicated static IP that for workflows within your workspace.
- When enabled on a workflow, all requests from that workflow go through the VPC. The SQL Proxy, on the other hand, routes requests for the relevant database connection through a shared static IP block.
