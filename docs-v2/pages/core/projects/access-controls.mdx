# Access Controls

The [projects list view](https://pipedream.com/projects) contains **Owner** and **Access** columns.

**Owner** indicates who within the workspace owns each project. This is typically the person who created the project.

<Callout type="warning">
  Projects created before February 2024 don't automatically have owners, which
  has no functional impact.
</Callout>

**Access** indicates which workspace members have access to each project, and this can be displayed as "me", "Workspace", or "N members".

## Permissions

Workspace owners and admins are able to perform all actions in projects, whereas workspace members are restricted from performing certain actions in projects.

<Callout type="info">
  **Workspace admins and owners have the same permissions as project creators
  for all projects in the workspace.**
</Callout>

## Managing access

<Callout type="info">
  By default, all projects are accessible to all workspace members. Workspaces
  on the [Business plan](https://pipedream.com/pricing) can restrict access for
  individual projects to specific workspace members.
</Callout>

You can easily modify the access rules for a project directly from the [project list view](https://pipedream.com/projects), either by clicking the access badge in the project row (fig 1) or clicking the 3 dots to open the action menu, then selecting **Manage Access** (fig 2).

Via the access badge (fig 1):

Via the action menu (fig 2):

![Click manage access from the action menu](/images/projects/manage-access-overflow-menu.png)

From here, a slideout drawer reveals the access management configuration:

![Manage access slideout workspace access](/images/projects/slideout-workspace-share.png)

Toggle the **Restrict access to this project** switch to manage access:

![Manage access slideout restricted](/images/projects/slideout-restricted.png)

Select specific members of the workspace to grant access:

You can always see who has access and remove access if necessary:
