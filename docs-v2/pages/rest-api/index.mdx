# REST API

## Overview

Use the REST API to create and manage sources, workflows, subscriptions, and more.

## Base URL

The base URL for all requests is [https://api.pipedream.com/v1](https://api.pipedream.com/v1).

## Authentication

You authenticate to the REST API using your [Pipedream API
key](/rest-api/auth/#pipedream-api-key). When you make API requests, pass an
`Authorization` header of the following format:

```
Authorization: Bearer <api key>
```

For example, here's how you can use `cURL` to fetch profile information for the
authenticated user:

```shell
curl 'https://api.pipedream.com/v1/users/me' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api_key>'
```

Learn more about [API authentication](/rest-api/auth/)

## Required headers

The `Authorization` header is required on all endpoints for authentication.

`POST` or `PUT` requests that accept JSON payloads also require a `Content-Type`
header set to `application/json`. For example:

```shell
curl https://api.pipedream.com/v1/components \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"component_url": "https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/blob/master/components/rss/sources/new-item-in-feed/new-item-in-feed.js"}'
```

## Common Parameters

The following parameters can be passed to any endpoint. They can be included as
query string params for `GET` requests, or in the body of the payload of `POST`
requests.

---

`include` **string**

The fields in the API response you'd like to include (defaults to all fields).
Pass as a string of comma-separated values:

`comma,separated,fields,to,include`

---

`exclude` **string**

The fields in the API response you'd like to _exclude_ (defaults to none,
including all fields). Pass as a string of comma-separated values:

`comma,separated,fields,to,include`

---

`workspace_id` **string**

Some endpoints require you to specify [your workspace ID](/workspaces/#finding-your-workspace-s-id) you want the operation to take effect in. For example, if you're creating a new event source in a specific workspace, you'll want to pass the workspace ID in the `workspace_id` query string parameter.

[Find your workspace's ID here](/workspaces/#finding-your-workspace-s-id).

<Callout type="info">
  If your organization is on one of our legacy plans like the Free Teams or
  Teams plan, the `workspace_id` is synonymous with your `org_id`. Just pass
  your organization ID as the same parameter.
</Callout>

## Working with resources owned by a workspace

If you're interacting with resources owned by a [workspace](/workspaces/), you may need to specify the workspace ID as a part of the request's query string parameter or route:

- When fetching specific resources (for example, when you [retrieve events for a specific source](#get-source-events)), you should not need to pass your workspace's ID. If your user is a part of the workspace, you should have access to that resource, and the API will return the details of the resource.
- When _creating_ new resources, you'll need to specify the `org_id` where you want the resource to live as a query string parameter (`?org_id=o_abc123`). Read more about the `org_id` parameter in the [Common Parameters section](#common-parameters).
- When _listing_ resources, use [the workspace-specific endpoints here](#workspaces).

## Pagination

Most API endpoints below support pagination, **with a default page size of 10
items**. You can vary the size of pages, and set a `before` or `after` cursor on
the results, using the following parameters. They can be included as query
string params for `GET` requests, or in the body of the payload of `POST`
requests.

---

`limit` **integer**

The number of items to return in the requested page of results.

- Default: 10
- Min: 1
- Max: 100

---

`after` **string**

A cursor, specifying you'd like to retrieve items _after_ this cursor.

Cursor strings are returned with all paginated responses.

---

`before` **string**

A cursor, specifying you'd like to retrieve items _before_ this cursor.

Cursor strings are returned with all paginated responses.

---

### Example Paginated Request

This request fetches a page of 5 sources in the authenticated account, after a
specific cursor (returned with a previous request):

```shell
curl https://api.pipedream.com/v1/users/me/sources\?limit\=3\&after\=ZGNfSzB1QWVl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api key>"
```

### Example Paginated Response

The response from the request above will have a shape that looks like:

```json
{
  "page_info": {
    "total_count": 3,
    "count": 3,
    "start_cursor": "ZGNfSzB1QWVl",
    "end_cursor": "ZGNfclhhdTZv"
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "dc_5YGuMo"
    },
    {
      "id": "dc_5v3unr"
    },
    {
      "id": "dc_rXau6o"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Errors

Pipedream uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or
failure of an API request. Codes in the **2xx** range indicate success. Codes in
the **4xx** range indicate an error that failed (e.g., a required parameter was
omitted). Codes in the **5xx** range indicate an error with Pipedream’s server.

## Accounts

[Connected accounts](/connected-accounts/) let you manage credentials for integrated APIs.

### Get account

---

By default, this route returns metadata for a specific connected account. Set `include_credentials=1` to return credentials that you can use in any app where you need auth. [See this guide](/connected-accounts/api/) to learn more.

#### Endpoint

```
GET /accounts/{account_id}
```

#### Parameters

---

`account_id` **string**

To retrieve your account ID:

1. [Connect your account](/connected-accounts/#connecting-a-new-account)
2. On [https://pipedream.com/accounts](https://pipedream.com/accounts), find your account and click the `...` to the right of the account,
3. **Copy Account ID**

<br />

`include_credentials` **number**

Default `0`: Response only contains account metadata, no credentials. Pass `1` to include `credentials`.

---

#### Example Request — Get account metadata

```bash
curl 'https://api.pipedream.com/v1/accounts/<account_id>' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### Example Response — Get account metadata

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "apn_abc123",
    "created_at": "2022-07-27T20:37:52.000Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-02-11T04:18:46.000Z",
    "name": "Google Sheets — pipedream.com", // account nickname, if set
    "app": {
      "id": "app_abc123",
      "name": "Google Sheets"
    },
    "healthy": true // true if Pipedream can make a successful test request
  }
}
```

#### Example Request — Get account credentials

```bash
curl 'https://api.pipedream.com/v1/accounts/<account_id>?include_credentials=1' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### Example Response — Get account credentials

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "apn_abc123",
    "created_at": "2022-07-27T20:37:52.000Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-02-11T04:18:46.000Z",
    "expires_at": "2024-02-11T05:18:46.000Z",
    "name": "Google Sheets — pipedream.com", // account nickname, if set
    "app": {
      "id": "app_abc123",
      "name": "Google Sheets"
    },
    "credentials": {
      // Properties are specific to the app — see below
    }
  }
}
```

#### The `credentials` object

The properties of the `credentials` object are specific to the app.

All OAuth apps expose the following properties:

- `oauth_access_token` — A fresh OAuth access token
- `oauth_client_id` — The client ID of the OAuth app
- `oauth_refresh_token` — The latest OAuth refresh token for your grant
- `oauth_uid` — A unique identifier in the third party API's system, typically a user ID or email address

Apps with static credentials expose fields specific to the API, e.g. `api_key`. Review the response for specific apps to see the app-specific response.

## Components

Components are objects that represent the code for an [event source](#sources).

### Create a component

---

Before you can create a source using the REST API, you must first create a
**component** - the code for the source.

This route returns the components `id`, `code`, `configurable_props`, and other
metadata you'll need to [deploy a source](#create-a-source) from this component.

#### Endpoint

```
POST /components
```

#### Parameters

---

`component_code` **string** (_optional_)

The full code for a [Pipedream component](/components/api/).

---

`component_url` **string** (_optional_)

A reference to the URL where the component is hosted.

For example, to create an RSS component, pass
`https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/blob/master/components/rss/sources/new-item-in-feed/new-item-in-feed.js`.

---

One of `component_code` _or_ `component_url` is required. If both are present,
`component_code` is preferred and `component_url` will be used only as metadata
to identify the location of the code.

#### Example Request

Here's an example of how to create an RSS component from a Github URL:

```shell
curl https://api.pipedream.com/v1/components \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"component_url": "https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/blob/master/components/rss/sources/new-item-in-feed/new-item-in-feed.js"}'
```

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "sc_JDi8EB",
    "code": "component code here",
    "code_hash": "685c7a680d055eaf505b08d5d814feef9fabd516d5960837d2e0838d3e1c9ed1",
    "name": "rss",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "configurable_props": [
      {
        "name": "url",
        "type": "string",
        "label": "Feed URL",
        "description": "Enter the URL for any public RSS feed."
      },
      {
        "name": "timer",
        "type": "$.interface.timer",
        "default": {
          "intervalSeconds": 900
        }
      }
    ],
    "created_at": 1588866900,
    "updated_at": 1588866900
  }
}
```

### Get a component

Retrieve a component saved or published in your account using its saved
component ID **or** key.

This endpoint returns the component's metadata and configurable props.

#### Endpoint

```
GET /components/{key|id}
```

#### Parameters

---

`key` **string**

The component key (identified by the `key` property within the component's
source code) you'd like to fetch metadata for (example: `my-component`)

**or**

`id` **string**

The saved component ID you'd like to fetch metadata for (example: `sc_JDi8EB`)

---

#### Example Request

```shell
curl https://api.pipedream.com/v1/components/my-component \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>"
```

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "sc_JDi8EB",
    "code": "component code here",
    "code_hash": "685c7a680d055eaf505b08d5d814feef9fabd516d5960837d2e0838d3e1c9ed1",
    "name": "rss",
    "version": "0.0.1",

        "name": "url",
        "type": "string",
        "label": "Feed URL",
        "description": "Enter the URL for any public RSS feed."
      },
      {
        "name": "timer",
        "type": "$.interface.timer",
        "default": {
          "intervalSeconds": 900
        }
      }
    ],
    "created_at": 1588866900,
    "updated_at": 1588866900
  }
}
```

### Get a component from the global registry

Pipedream operates a global registry of all public components (for example, for
apps like Github, Google Calendar, and more). This endpoint returns the same
data as the endpoint for [retrieving metadata on a component you
own](#get-a-component), but allows you to fetch data for any globally-published
component.

#### Endpoint

```
GET /components/registry/{key}
```

#### Parameters

---

`key` **string**

The component key (identified by the `key` property within the component's
source code) you'd like to fetch metadata for (example: `my-component`)

---

#### Example Request

```shell
curl https://api.pipedream.com/v1/components/registry/github-new-repository \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>"
```

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "sc_JDi8EB",
    "code": "component code here",
    "code_hash": "685c7a680d055eaf505b08d5d814feef9fabd516d5960837d2e0838d3e1c9ed1",
    "name": "rss",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "configurable_props": [
      {
        "name": "url",
        "type": "string",
        "label": "Feed URL",
        "description": "Enter the URL for any public RSS feed."
      },
      {
        "name": "timer",
        "type": "$.interface.timer",
        "default": {
          "intervalSeconds": 900
        }
      }
    ],
    "created_at": 1588866900,
    "updated_at": 1588866900
  }
}
```

## Events

### Get Source Events

---

Retrieve up to the last 100 events emitted by a source.

#### Endpoint

```
GET /sources/{id}/event_summaries
```

#### Notes and Examples

The event data for events larger than `1KB` may get truncated in the response.
If you're processing larger events, and need to see the full event data, pass
`?expand=event`:

```
GET /sources/{id}/event_summaries?expand=event
```

Pass `?limit=N` to retrieve the last **N** events:

```
GET /sources/{id}/event_summaries?limit=10
```

### Delete source events

---

Deletes all events, or a specific set of events, tied to a source.

By default, making a `DELETE` request to this endpoint deletes **all** events
associated with a source. To delete a specific event, or a range of events, you
can use the `start_id` and `end_id` parameters.

These IDs can be retrieved by using the [`GET /sources/{id}/event_summaries`
endpoint](/api/rest/#get-source-events), and are tied to the timestamp at which
the event was emitted — e.g. `1589486981597-0`. They are therefore naturally
ordered by time.

#### Endpoint

```
DELETE /sources/{id}/events
```

#### Parameters

---

`start_id` **string**

The event ID from which you'd like to start deleting events.

If `start_id` is passed without `end_id`, the request will delete all events
starting with and including this event ID. For example, if your source has 3
events:

- `1589486981597-0`
- `1589486981598-0`
- `1589486981599-0`

and you issue a `DELETE` request like so:

```shell
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api key>" \
  "https://api.pipedream.com/v1/sources/dc_abc123/events?start_id=1589486981598-0"
```

The request will delete the **last two events**.

---

`end_id` **string**

The event ID from which you'd like to end the range of deletion.

If `end_id` is passed without `start_id`, the request will delete all events up
to and including this event ID. For example, if your source has 3 events:

- `1589486981597-0`
- `1589486981598-0`
- `1589486981599-0`

and you issue a `DELETE` request like so:

```shell
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api key>" \
  "https://api.pipedream.com/v1/sources/dc_abc123/events?end_id=1589486981598-0"
```

The request will delete the **first two events**.

---

#### Example Request

You can delete a single event by passing its event ID in both the value of the
`start_id` and `end_id` params:

```shell
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api key>" \
  "https://api.pipedream.com/v1/sources/dc_abc123/events?start_id=1589486981598-0&end_id=1589486981598-0"
```

#### Example Response

Deletion happens asynchronously, so you'll receive a `202 Accepted` HTTP status
code in response to any deletion requests.

### List Projects

Programmatically list the workspace's projects.

#### Endpoint

```
GET /v1/workspaces/<workspace_id>/projects
```

#### Path Parameters

`workspaces_id` **string**

[Switch to your workspace's context](/workspaces/#switching-between-workspaces) and [find your org's ID](/workspaces/#finding-your-workspace-s-id).

#### Example Responses

```
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "proj_kYRs18",
      "hid": "proj_kYRs18",
      "name": "Sample Project",
      "repository_id": null,
      "repository_path": null,
      "created_at": "2024-02-05T21:47:24.000Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-02-06T16:13:07.000Z",
      "org_id": 1,
      "exceptions": null,
      "allow_support": false
    }
  ]
```

## Sources

Event sources run code to collect events from an API, or receive events via
webhooks, emitting those events for use on Pipedream. Event sources can function
as workflow triggers. [Read more here](/sources/).

---

#### Endpoint

```
GET /users/me/sources/
```

#### Parameters

### Delete a source

---

#### Endpoint

```
DELETE /sources/{id}
```

## Subscriptions

### Listen for events from another source or workflow

---

You can configure a source or workflow to receive events from any number of
other workflows or sources. For example, if you want a single workflow to run on
10 different RSS sources, you can configure the workflow to _listen_ for events
from those 10 sources.

---

#### Endpoint

```
POST /subscriptions?emitter_id={emitting_component_id}&event_name={event_name}&listener_id={receiving_source_id}
```

#### Parameters

---

`emitter_id` **string**

The ID of the workflow or component emitting events. Events from this component
trigger the receiving component / workflow.

`emitter_id` also accepts glob patterns that allow you to subscribe to _all_
workflows or components:

- `p_*`: Listen to events from all workflows
- `dc_*`: Listen to events from all event sources

[See the component endpoints](/api/rest/#components) for information on how to
retrieve the ID of existing components. You can retrieve the ID of your workflow
in your workflow's URL - it's the string `p_2gCPml` in
`https://pipedream.com/@dylan/example-rss-sql-workflow-p_2gCPml/edit`.

---

`event_name` **string** (optional)

**Only pass `event_name` when you're listening for events on a custom channel, with the name of the custom channel**:

```
event_name=<custom_channel>
```

See [the `this.$emit` docs](/components/api/#emit) for more information on how to emit events on custom channels.

Pipedream also exposes channels for logs and errors:

- `$errors`: Any errors thrown by workflows or sources are emitted to this
  stream
- `$logs`: Any logs produced by **event sources** are emitted to this stream

---

`listener_id` **string**

The ID of the component or workflow you'd like to receive events.

[See the component endpoints](/api/rest/#components) for information on how to
retrieve the ID of existing components. You can retrieve the ID of your workflow
in your workflow's URL - it's the string `p_2gCPml` in
`https://pipedream.com/@dylan/example-rss-sql-workflow-p_2gCPml/edit`.

---

#### Example Request

You can configure workflow `p_abc123` to listen to events from the source
`dc_def456` using the following command:

```shell
curl "https://api.pipedream.com/v1/subscriptions?emitter_id=dc_def456&listener_id=p_abc123" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Automatically subscribe a listener to events from new workflows / sources

---

You can use this endpoint to automatically receive events, like workflow errors,
in another listening workflow or event source. Once you setup the
auto-subscription, any new workflows or event sources you create will
automatically deliver the specified events to the listener.

Note: this will configure subscriptions for _new_ workflows and sources after
the time you configure the subscription. To deliver events to your listener from
_existing_ workflows or sources, use the [`POST /subscriptions`
endpoint](#listen-for-events-from-another-source-or-workflow).

**Currently, this feature is enabled only on the API. The Pipedream UI will not
display the sources configured as listeners using this API**.

---

#### Endpoint

```
POST /auto_subscriptions?event_name={event_name}&listener_id={receiving_source_id}
```

#### Parameters

---

`event_name` **string**

The name of the event stream whose events you'd like to receive:

- `$errors`: Any errors thrown by workflows or sources are emitted to this
  stream
- `$logs`: Any logs produced by **event sources** are emitted to this stream

---

`listener_id` **string**

The ID of the component or workflow you'd like to receive events.

[See the component endpoints](/api/rest/#components) for information on how to
retrieve the ID of existing components. You can retrieve the ID of your workflow
in your workflow's URL - it's the string `p_2gCPml` in
`https://pipedream.com/@dylan/example-rss-sql-workflow-p_2gCPml/edit`.

---

#### Example Request

You can configure workflow `p_abc123` to listen to events from the source
`dc_def456` using the following command:

```shell
curl "https://api.pipedream.com/v1/auto_subscriptions?event_name=$errors&listener_id=p_abc123" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Delete a subscription

---

Use this endpoint to delete an existing subscription. This endpoint accepts the
same parameters as the [`POST /subscriptions`
endpoint](#listen-for-events-from-another-source-or-workflow) for creating
subscriptions.

---

#### Endpoint

```
DELETE /subscriptions?emitter_id={emitting_component_id}&listener_id={receiving_source_id}&event_name={event_name}
```

#### Parameters

---

`emitter_id` **string**

The ID of the workflow or component emitting events. Events from this component
trigger the receiving component / workflow.

`emitter_id` also accepts glob patterns that allow you to subscribe to _all_
workflows or components:

- `p_*`: Listen to events from all workflows
- `dc_*`: Listen to events from all event sources

[See the component endpoints](/api/rest/#components) for information on how to
retrieve the ID of existing components. You can retrieve the ID of your workflow
in your workflow's URL - it's the string `p_2gCPml` in
`https://pipedream.com/@dylan/example-rss-sql-workflow-p_2gCPml/edit`.

---

`listener_id` **string**

The ID of the component or workflow you'd like to receive events.

[See the component endpoints](/api/rest/#components) for information on how to
retrieve the ID of existing components. You can retrieve the ID of your workflow
in your workflow's URL - it's the string `p_2gCPml` in
`https://pipedream.com/@dylan/example-rss-sql-workflow-p_2gCPml/edit`.

---

`event_name` **string**

The name of the event stream tied to your subscription. **If you didn't specify
an `event_name` when creating your subscription, pass `event_name=`**.

You'll find the `event_name` that's tied to your subscription when [listing your
subscriptions](#get-current-user-s-subscriptions):

```javascript
{
  "id": "sub_abc123",
  "emitter_id": "dc_abc123",
  "listener_id": "dc_def456",
  "event_name": "test"
},
{
  "id": "sub_def456",
  "emitter_id": "dc_abc123",
  "listener_id": "wh_abc123",
  "event_name": ""
}
```

---

#### Example Request

You can delete a subscription you configured for workflow `p_abc123` to listen
to events from the source `dc_def456` using the following command:

```shell
curl "https://api.pipedream.com/v1/subscriptions?emitter_id=dc_def456&listener_id=p_abc123" \
  -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>" \

## Webhooks

Pipedream supports webhooks as a way to deliver events to a endpoint you own.
Webhooks are managed at an account-level, and you send data to these webhooks
using [subscriptions](#subscriptions).

For example, you can run a Twitter [event source](/sources/) that listens
for new tweets. If you [subscribe](#subscriptions) the webhook to this source,
Pipedream will deliver those tweets directly to your webhook's URL without
running a workflow.

[**See these tutorials**](/api/rest/webhooks/) for examples.

### Create a webhook

Creates a webhook pointing to a URL. Configure a [subscription](#subscriptions)
to deliver events to this webhook.

#### Endpoint

```
POST /webhooks?url={your_endpoint_url}&name={name}&description={description}
```

#### Parameters

---

`url` **string**

The endpoint URL where you'd like to deliver events. Any events sent to this
webhook object will be delivered to this endpoint URL.

This URL **must** contain, at a minimum, a protocol — one of `http` or `https` —
and hostname, but can specify resources or ports. For example, these URLs work:

```
https://example.com
http://example.com
https://example.com:12345/endpoint
```

but these do not:

```
# No protocol - needs http(s)://
example.com

# mysql protocol not supported. Must be an HTTP(S) endpoint
mysql://user:pass@host:port
```

---

`name` **string**

The name you'd like to assign to this webhook, which will appear when [listing
your webhooks](#get-current-user-s-webhooks).

---

`description` **string**

The description you'd like to assign to this webhook, which will appear when
[listing your webhooks](#get-current-user-s-webhooks).

#### Example Request

You can create a webhook that delivers events to
`https://endpoint.m.pipedream.net` using the following command:

```shell
curl "https://api.pipedream.com/v1/webhooks?url=https://endpoint.m.pipedream.net&name=name&description=description" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### Example Response

Successful API responses contain a webhook ID for the webhook that was created
in `data.id` — the string that starts with `wh_` — which you can reference when
creating [subscriptions](#subscriptions).

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "wh_abc123",
    "user_id": "u_abc123",
    "name": null,
    "description": null,
    "url": "https://endpoint.m.pipedream.net",
    "active": true,
    "created_at": 1611964025,
    "updated_at": 1611964025
  }
}
```

### List webhooks

You can list webhooks you've created in your account using the
[`/users/me/webhooks` endpoint](#get-current-user-s-webhooks)

### Delete a webhook

---

Use this endpoint to delete a webhook in your account.

#### Endpoint

```
