# Projects

A workspace can contain one or more _projects_. Projects are a way to organize your workflows into specific groupings or categories.

## Getting started with projects

### Creating projects

To create a new project, first [open the Projects section in the dashboard](https://pipedream.com/projects).

Then click **Create project** to start a new project.

Enter in your desired name for the project in the prompt, then click **Create**.

That's it, you now have a dedicated new project created within your workspace. Now you can create workflows within this project, or move workflows into it or create folders for further organization.

### Creating folders and workflows in projects

Within a given project, you can create folders for your workflows.

Open your project, and then click the **New** button for a dropdown to create a workflow in your current project.

- `C then F` creates a new folder.
- `C then W` creates a new workflow.

</Callout>

Folders can also contain sub-folders, which allows you to create a filing system to organize your workflows.

### Moving workflows into folders

To move workflows into folders, simply drag and drop the workflow into the folder.

You can move workflows or folders up a level by dragging and dropping the workflow to the folder icon at the top of the list.

### Importing workflows into projects

To import a workflow from the general **Workflows** area of your dashboard into a project:

2. Select one or more workflows you'd like to import into a project
3. Click *Move* in the top right and select a project to move them to

### Moving workflows between projects

To move a workflow from one project to another project, first check the workflow and then click **Move** to open a dropdown of projects. Select the project to move this workflow to, and click **Move** once more to complete the move.
