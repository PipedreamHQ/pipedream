### Delay

<VideoPlayer title="Delaying Workflow Steps" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IBORwBnIZ-k" />

Sometimes you need to wait a specific amount of time before the next step of your workflow proceeds. Pipedream supports this in one of two ways:

1. The built-in **Delay** actions
2. The `$.flow.delay` function in Node.js

{process.env.DELAY_MIN_MAX_TIME}. For example, we at Pipedream use this functionality to delay welcome emails to our customers until they've had a chance to use the product.

#### Delay actions

You can pause your workflow without writing code using the **Delay** actions:

1. Click the **+** button below any step
2. Search for the **Delay** app
3. Select the **Delay Workflow** action
4. Configure the action to delay any amount of time, up to one year

#### `$.flow.delay`

If you need to delay a workflow within Node.js code, or you need detailed control over how delays occur, [see the docs on `$.flow.delay`](/code/nodejs/delay/).

#### The state of delayed executions

Delayed executions can hold one of three states:

- **Paused**: The execution is within the delay window, and the workflow is still paused
- **Resumed**: The workflow has been resumed at the end of its delay window automatically, or resumed manually
- **Cancelled**: The execution was cancelled manually

You'll see the current state of an execution by [viewing its event data](/workflows/events/inspect/).

#### Cancelling or resuming execution manually

The [**Delay** actions](#delay-actions) and [`$.flow.delay`](/code/nodejs/delay/) return two URLs each time they run:

These URLs are specific to a single execution of your workflow. While the workflow is paused, you can load these in your browser or send an HTTP request to either:

- Hitting the `cancel_url` will immediately cancel that execution
- Hitting the `resume_url` will immediately resume that execution early

If you use [`$.flow.delay`](/code/nodejs/delay/), you can send these URLs to your own system to handle cancellation / resumption. You can even email your customers to let them cancel / resume workflows that run on their behalf.
