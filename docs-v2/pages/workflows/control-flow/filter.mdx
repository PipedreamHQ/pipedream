Use the Filter action to quickly stop or continue workflows on certain conditions.

Add a filter action to your workflow by searching for the **Filter** app in a new step.

The **Filter** app includes several built-in actions: Continue Workflow on Condition, Exit Workflow on Condition and Exit Workflow on Custom Condition.

In each of these actions, the **Value** is the subject of the condition, and the **Condition** is the operand to compare the value against.

For example, to only process orders with a `status = ready`

#### Continue Workflow on Condition

With this action, only when values that _pass_ a set condition will the workflow continue to execute steps after this filter.
