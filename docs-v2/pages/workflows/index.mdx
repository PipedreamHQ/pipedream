# What are workflows?

<VideoPlayer src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wnDijEtYaT0" title="What are workflows?" />

Workflows make it easy to integrate your apps, data, and APIs - all with no servers or infrastructure to manage. They're sequences of [steps](/workflows/steps) [triggered by an event](/workflows/triggers), like an HTTP request, or new rows in a Google sheet.

You can use [pre-built actions](/workflows/actions/) or custom [Node.js](/code/nodejs/), [Python](/code/python/), [Golang](/code/go/), or [Bash](/code/bash/) code in workflows and connect to any of our {process.env.PUBLIC_APPS} integrated apps.

Read [our quickstart](/quickstart/) or watch our videos on [Pipedream University](https://pipedream.com/university) to learn more.

## How do I create a new workflow?

To create a new workflow, first [create a project](/projects/). Then click **New**, title your workflow, and start adding steps.
