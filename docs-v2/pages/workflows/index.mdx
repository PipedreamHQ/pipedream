# Overview 

Workflows are applications that you build and run on Pipedream to automate any event-driven and batch processes. Integrate APIs, AI, databases and more with code-level control when you need it and no code when you don't â€” all with no servers or infrastructure to manage (no devops required).

## Key Capabilities

### Build, Run and Monitor

- Build workflows using the purpose-built IDE
- Test workflows step-by-step to validate changes with real-world data
- Deploy with a click to run your workflow in production
- Inspect workflow executions in real-time, get alerts on errors and debug events
- View and restore any edit/revision or production deployment
- Sync your changes with GitHub repos for source control

### Triggers & Event Queues

- Trigger workflows on HTTP requests, schedules, external app events and more
- Manage the concurrency and execution rate at which event streams invoke workflows

### Event and Step Data
- Pass any JSON-serializable data between steps and reference it directly in code or in pre-built actions by referencing the `steps` object
- Process large files using the large upload flag for HTTP endpoints or using File Stores

### HTTP / Webhook
 
- Generate unique trigger URLs with a click
- Make HTTP requests from any step with an intuitive request builder
- Return custom HTTP responses from HTTP-triggered workflows
- Configure custom domains to trigger workflows on your own domain (e.g. `https://endpoint.yourdomain.com`)

### Apps & APIs

- Connect OAuth and key-based accounts for ${process.env.PUBLIC_APPS} apps
- Use apps in [pre-built triggers and actions](/workflows/actions/) 
- Programmatically access OAuth tokens and API keys securely in code or via our API request builder
- Configure your own OAuth client for any app

### Code

- Run custom custom [Node.js](/code/nodejs/), [Python](/code/python/), [Golang](/code/go/), or [Bash](/code/bash/) 
- Use most npm and pypi packages
- Develop and publish private triggers and actions via CLI

### Databases

- Connect to databases with shared and dedicated static IP options
- Build queries with an intuitive schema explorer and SQL editor

### Orchestration & Fault Tolerance
- Orchestrate execution of non-linear workflows
- Normalize results and continue after a non-linear operation
- Nest control flow operators for advanced use cases
- Return HTTP responses during or after most non-linear operations
- Execute long running workflows (workflow timeout resets at each control flow boundary)
- Enable auto-retry to recover from intermittent errors automatically 

### Autoscaling
- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2

### Built-In Services
- Use data stores to maintain state across workflow executions.
- Run workflows in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPCs) to isolate the network and get a static egress IP unique to your workspace
- Inspect workflow executions and logs in real-time

## Getting Started

<Callout type="info">
When you create a new workflow, first add a trigger and then generate and select a trigger event. Trigger events provide data to help you configure and test your workflow.
