## Key Capabilities

### Integrate 2,200+ APIs in seconds

Auth apps once, then reuse connected accounts in any workflow with 5,000+ pre-built, source-available components. Removing the need to manage authentication and write boilerplate code.

### First-Class Support for HTTP,  Code and Databases

- Generate unique trigger URLs with a click, make HTTP requests from any step with an intuitive request builder, and return custom HTTP responses from workflows
- Execute custom logic using Node.js, Python, Go, or Bash. With instant deployment to run 24 x 7 x 365 on Pipedream’s servers. Allowing full code level control of your data and no server management overhead. Leverage millions of npm and PyPi packages, with automatic installation of dependencies. Saving time and effort when customizing your workflows with Node.js or Python.
- Connect to databases with shared and dedicated static IP options, and build queries with an intuitive schema explorer and SQL editor

### Automate Complex Processes

- Orchestrate execution of non-linear workflows
- Normalize results and continue after a non-linear operation

<Callout type="info">
A workflow that executes once for less than 30 seconds total

This is the most common scenario. Regardless of the number of steps within the workflow, if it completes it's execution under 30 seconds then only one credit is incurred.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
A workflow that executes 5 times with 1 second per run

5 credits are incurred, because the workflow ran for a total of 5 executions and under the 30 second threshold (5 executions at 1 credit each).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
A workflow that executes 2 times with 35 seconds per run

4 credits are incurred, because each workflow execution exceeded 1 credit time limit of 30 seconds by 5 seconds.
</Callout>
