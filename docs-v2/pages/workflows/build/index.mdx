# Overview

## Builder

LAYOUT

The new builder is backwards compatible with workflows created in the previous 2.0 builder and introduces powerful new capabilities and adapts common IDE patterns:

- Split panes to edit steps side-by-side
- Quickly switch between recent steps via tabs
- Resize the editor (you're no longer limited by the width of a step)
- Workflow-wide find and replace (across code and action inputs)
- More performant code editor
- Drag-and-drop steps on the canvas
- Refined design, performance improvements and much more

If you encounter any issues you can switch back to the Legacy 2.0 builder in [application settings](https://pipedream.com/settings/application).
