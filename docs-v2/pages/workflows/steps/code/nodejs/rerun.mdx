# Pause, resume, and rerun a workflow

You can use `$.flow.suspend` and `$.flow.rerun` to pause a workflow and resume it later.

This is useful when you want to:

- Pause a workflow until someone manually approves it
- Poll an external API until some job completes, and proceed with the workflow when it's done
- Trigger an external API to start a job, pause the workflow, and resume it when the external API sends an HTTP callback

We'll cover all of these examples below.

## `$.flow.suspend`

Use `$.flow.suspend` when you want to pause a workflow and proceed with the remaining steps only when manually approved or cancelled.

For example, you can suspend a workflow and send yourself a link to manually resume or cancel the rest of the workflow:

```javascript
export default defineComponent({
  async run({ $ }) {
    const { resume_url, cancel_url } = $.flow.suspend();
    $.send.email({
      subject: "Please approve this important workflow",
      text: `Click here to approve the workflow: ${resume_url}, and cancel here: ${cancel_url}`,
    });
    // Pipedream suspends your workflow at the end of the step
  },
});
```

You'll receive an email like this:

<br />
<img

  alt="approve this workflow"
  width="100%"
/>
<br />

And can resume or cancel the rest of the workflow by clicking on the appropriate link.

### `resume_url` and `cancel_url`

In general, calling `$.flow.suspend` returns a `cancel_url` and `resume_url` that lets you cancel or resume paused executions. Since Pipedream pauses your workflow at the _end_ of the step, you can pass these URLs to any external service before the workflow pauses. If that service accepts a callback URL, it can trigger the `resume_url` when its work is complete.

These URLs are specific to a single execution of your workflow. While the workflow is paused, you can load these in your browser or send any HTTP request to them:

- Sending an HTTP request to the `cancel_url` will cancel that execution
- Sending an HTTP request to the `resume_url` will resume that execution

If you resume a workflow, any data sent in the HTTP request is passed to the workflow and returned in the `$resume_data` [step export](/workflows/steps/#step-exports) of the suspended step. For example, if you call `$.flow.suspend` within a step named `code`, the `$resume_data` export should contain the data sent in the `resume_url` request:

<br />

  alt="resume data step export"
  width="350px"
/>
<br />

Requests to the `resume_url` have [the same limits as any HTTP request to Pipedream](/limits/#http-request-body-size), but you can send larger payloads using our [large payload](/workflows/steps/triggers/#sending-large-payloads) or [large file](/workflows/steps/triggers/#large-file-support) interfaces.

### Default timeout of 24 hours

By default, `$.flow.suspend` will automatically cancel the workflow after 24 hours. You can set your own timeout (in milliseconds) as the first argument:

```javascript
export default defineComponent({
  async run({ $ }) {
    // 7 days
    const TIMEOUT = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7;
    $.flow.suspend(TIMEOUT);
  },
});
```

## `$.flow.rerun`

  title="Rerunning a Node.js code step with $.rerun"
/>

Use `$.flow.rerun` when you want to run a specific step of a workflow multiple times. This is useful when you need to start a job in an external API and poll for its completion, or have the service call back to the step and let you process the HTTP request within the step.

### Retrying a Failed API Request

`$.flow.rerun` can be used to conditionally retry a failed API request due to a service outage or rate limit reached. Place the `$.flow.rerun` call within a `catch` block to only retry the API request if an error is thrown:

```javascript
import { axios } from "@pipedream/platform";

export default defineComponent({
  props: {
    openai: {
      type: "app",
      app: "openai",
    },
  },
  async run({ steps, $ }) {
    try {
      return await axios($, {
        url: `https://api.openai.com/v1/completions`,
        method: "post",
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${this.openai.$auth.api_key}`,
        },
        data: {
          model: "text-davinci-003",
          prompt: "Say this is a test",
          max_tokens: 7,
          temperature: 0,
        },
      });
    } catch (error) {
      const MAX_RETRIES = 3;
      const DELAY = 1000 * 30;

      // Retry the request every 30 seconds, for up to 3 times
      $.flow.rerun(DELAY, null, MAX_RETRIES);
    }
  },
});
```

### Polling for the status of an external job

Sometimes you need to poll for the status of an external job until it completes. `$.flow.rerun` lets you rerun a specific step multiple times:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

export default defineComponent({
  async run({ $ }) {
    const MAX_RETRIES = 3;
    // 10 seconds
    const DELAY = 1000 * 10;
    const { run } = $.context;
    // $.context.run.runs starts at 1 and increments when the step is rerun
    if (run.runs === 1) {
      // $.flow.rerun(delay, context (discussed below), max retries)
      $.flow.rerun(DELAY, null, MAX_RETRIES);
    } else if (run.runs === MAX_RETRIES + 1) {
      throw new Error("Max retries exceeded");
    } else {
      // Poll external API for status
      const { data } = await axios({
        method: "GET",
        url: "https://example.com/status",
      });
      // If we're done, continue with the rest of the workflow
      if (data.status === "DONE") return data;

      // Else retry later
      $.flow.rerun(DELAY, null, MAX_RETRIES);
    }
  },
});
```

`$.flow.rerun` accepts the following arguments:

```javascript
$.flow.rerun(
  delay, // The number of milliseconds until the step will be rerun
  context, // JSON-serializable data you need to pass between runs
  maxRetries // The total number of times the step will rerun. Defaults to 10
);
```

### Accept an HTTP callback from an external service

When you trigger a job in an external service, and that service can send back data in an HTTP callback to Pipedream, you can process that data within the same step using `$.flow.rerun`:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

export default defineComponent({
  async run({ steps, $ }) {
    const TIMEOUT = 86400 * 1000;
    const { run } = $.context;
    // $.context.run.runs starts at 1 and increments when the step is rerun
    if (run.runs === 1) {
      const { cancel_url, resume_url } = $.flow.rerun(TIMEOUT, null, 1);

      // Send resume_url to external service
      await axios({
        method: "POST",
        url: "your callback URL",
        data: {
          resume_url,
          cancel_url,
        },
      });
    }

    // When the external service calls back into the resume_url, you have access to
    // the callback data within $.context.run.callback_request
    else if (run.callback_request) {
      return run.callback_request;
    }
  },
});
```

### Passing `context` to `$.flow.rerun`

Within a Node.js code step, `$.context.run.context` contains the `context` passed from the prior call to `rerun`. This lets you pass data from one run to another. For example, if you call:

```javascript
$.flow.rerun(1000, { hello: "world" });
```

`$.context.run.context` will contain:

<br />

  alt="resume data step export"
  width="250px"
/>
<br />

### `maxRetries`

By default, `maxRetries` is **10**.

When you exceed `maxRetries`, the workflow proceeds to the next step. If you need to handle this case with an exception, `throw` an error from the step:

```javascript
export default defineComponent({
  async run({ $ }) {
    const MAX_RETRIES = 3;
    const { run } = $.context;
    if (run.runs === 1) {
      $.flow.rerun(1000, null, MAX_RETRIES);
    } else if (run.runs === MAX_RETRIES + 1) {
      throw new Error("Max retries exceeded");
    }
  },
});
```

## Behavior when testing

When you're building a workflow and test a step with `$.flow.suspend` or `$.flow.rerun`, it will not suspend the workflow, and you'll see a message like the following:

> Workflow execution canceled — this may be due to `$.flow.suspend()` usage (not supported in test)

These functions will only suspend and resume when run in production.

## Credits when using `suspend` / `rerun`

You are not charged for the time your workflow is suspended during a `$.flow.rerun` or `$.flow.suspend`. Only when workflows are resumed will compute time count toward [credit usage](/pricing/#credits).

<Callout type="warning">
When a suspended workflow reawakens, it will reset the credit counter.

Each rerun or reawakening from a suspension will count as a new fresh credit.

</Callout>
