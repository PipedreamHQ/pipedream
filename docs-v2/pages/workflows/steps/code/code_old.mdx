# Code

## Overview

Pipedream provides first-class support for writing and running code. 

- Access OAuth tokens and keys for any of Pipedream's 2,200+ integrated apps to authenticate API requests in code
- Use most npm packages with no npm install or package.json required

Pre-built actions are code steps that use props to generate forms to capture user input and are published to hide the code. However, you can view the code for all registry actions in Pipedream's GitHub repo. See the reference for your preferred runtime to learn more.

## Importing and Exporting Data

You can reference data exported by any prior steps of your workflow by referencing the `steps` object, and you can export any JSON-serializable data by returning it or using an export function.

## Runtimes

- Node
